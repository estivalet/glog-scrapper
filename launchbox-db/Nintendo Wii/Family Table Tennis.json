{"altername_name": ["Okiraku Ping Pong"], "name": "Family Table Tennis", "overview": "It's time for some good old family fun, and what's more fun than table tennis? Just like a real family, choose your character from a cast of four, which includes Daddy, Mommy, Sarah and Billy. There are four table tennis-tastic stages where it doesn't matter if you're an indoors or outdoors table-tennis player. Pick your poison from a gymnasium, a forest park, a beach or even an amusement park. Choose from Single or Versus mode, or select a minigame to play. In Versus mode, you and a friend can play against each other to see who is the better table-tennis player. And if Single and Versus modes aren't enough, select between three minigames, which include Target Table Tennis, Thrilling Table Tennis and Matching Table Tennis. The appealing cell-shaded graphics and endearing music, on top of the super-fun game play, will have you and your family playing from morning till night. Get your paddles ready.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Arc System Works", "publishers": "Aksys Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Table_Tennis", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23828-family-table-tennis\n"}
