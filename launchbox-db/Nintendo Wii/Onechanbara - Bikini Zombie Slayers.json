{"altername_name": ["Oneechanbara Revolution"], "name": "Onechanbara: Bikini Zombie Slayers", "overview": "Zombie carnage and armed babes with tight outfits ... that's Onechanbara in a nutshell, and the blood-spurting, short skirting action series comes to the Wii in all of its visceral glory. Players can master the sword to take full advantage of the Wii Remote motion controls by slashing, swinging and thrusting into zombie enemy hordes. Play as either sister Aya or Saki in single player or with a friend in Co-Op Mode and utilize each of their unique fighting styles and set of moves. Get too much blood on either sister and be driven into Rage Mode and gain more power and agility to destroy enemies faster and deadlier. Every person met and enemy battled brings the sisters closer to understanding who or what is behind the zombie outbreak and putting an end to it.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 10, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Tamsoft", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneChanbara:_Bikini_Zombie_Slayers", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLo6tdf87_w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13524-onechanbara-bikini-zombie-slayers\n"}
