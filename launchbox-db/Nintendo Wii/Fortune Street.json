{"altername_name": ["Boom Street", "Boom Street", "Itadaki Street Wii: Dragon Quest & Super Mario", "Strassen des Gl\u00fccks"], "name": "Fortune Street", "overview": "Fortune Street, developed by Square Enix, brings together the characters of both the Mario and Dragon Quest universes into one gaming experience. Now fans of the two series can finally see Yoshi stand alongside a Slime, or Mario face off against a Platypunk\u2026 just not in the way you're probably expecting. Rather than an epic adventure (or sports collection), Fortune Street is a video board game in the same vein as Monopoly. Known in Japan as Itadaki Street, Fortune Street marks the first time this franchise (which has been around for more than two decades) will be released in the States. Created by Yuji Horii, the man behind Dragon Quest, the game has players rolling dice and moving around oddly-shaped boards. Much like Monopoly, you use your starting wealth of cash to purchase unoccupied property you land on, which you can expand the value of by investing in (you can do this when you land on one of your own lots or on the bank square). Buy more than one piece of property in the same district and the value of your assets rises. If someone lands on one of your lots they have to pay you rent that turn. Your property becomes your primary source of income and power as the game progresses, so it's extremely important to invest wisely. The ultimate goal is to make as much bank as possible and force your opponents into bankruptcy.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "January 6, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8871-fortune-street\n"}
