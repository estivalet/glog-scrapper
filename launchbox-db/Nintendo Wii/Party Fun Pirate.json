Thrust a sword into the wrong hole and you'll send your captain flying, which means it's game over for you! Unique Wii features add to the excitement, making for a fun-filled party game. Try swapping out the captain and putting your custom Mii character in the barrel for some real laughs!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "TOMY", "publishers": "Tomy", "genres": "", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_Pirate#Video_game", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78329-party-fun-pirate\n"}
