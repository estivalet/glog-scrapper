{"altername_name": ["Soul Eater"], "name": "Soul Eater: Monotone Princess", "overview": "Three Soul Eater video games were produced. The first, Soul Eater: Monotone Princess, is an action-adventure video game exclusively for the Wii and developed by Square Enix with Bones. It was released on September 25, 2008 in Japan. Two characters that appear in the game, Grimoire and Ponera, are original characters designed by author Atsushi \u014ckubo; Ponera is the titular Monotone Princess and Grimoire is known as Noah in the manga. The player controls a Meister, either Maka, Black Star or Death the Kid, accompanied by their Weapon partner to fight those masked creatures. The game is separated in a number of missions leading to a boss fight. A number of foes, displayed in the lower-right corner, must be found and defeated in each stage. While exploring, the Weapon follows the Meister in human form, and changes into a weapon when enemies are encountered. Health is replenished by sun icons found by breaking crates lying around during exploration phases. Once the target number of defeated foes is reached, the level is cleared, and the player is rated on clear time, damage taken, number of hits and level bonus. The next mission can then be selected.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "September 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Eater_(manga)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128467-soul-eater-monotone-princess\n"}
