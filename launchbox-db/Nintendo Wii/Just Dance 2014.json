Players join a virtual crew--made up of real-life friends or other Just Dance fans--and compete based on different themes. On Stage Mode: Own the spotlight in this new mode where one player will dance, lead 2 back-up dancers, and even sing if they want! As the star of the show, the player can take it seriously and show off how talented they are, or just goof off with friends. Custom Sweat Mode: Players can personalize their Just Sweat workouts by creating custom playlists and tracking calories. There's also a new option to track calories in all gameplay modes, even outside of the dedicated Just Sweat mode. More Dances Per Track: Everyone loves variety! Find alternate choreography across all modes including Just Sweat, Extreme, Battle and Mash-Up.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 1, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12odQj-Kboo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17565-just-dance-2014\n"}
