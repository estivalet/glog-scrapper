Regardless of fresh or saltwater, you can select from over 40 popular types of fish; including favorites like the Ocellaris Clownfish, the Freshwater Angelfish, and the Asian Arowana. You can also create up to six different aquariums and personalize them by adding decorations like seaweed and driftwood. In My Aquarium, you can send aquariums to your registered friends. The aquariums can even be set with special dates, such as a friend's birthday, when the fish will commemorate it with a dance. Feed your fish, and watch them steadily grow from fry to adult. Then, after meeting certain conditions, you can breed them! Another fun feature will allow you to interact with your fish using your Wii Remote, such as \"tapping\" the glass of your aquarium!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "August 15, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29647-my-aquarium\n"}
