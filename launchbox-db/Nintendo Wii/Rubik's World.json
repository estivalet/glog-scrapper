The videogame features the famous Rubik's Cube, originally designed by the Hungarian inventor Ern\u0151 Rubik. The game contains the likeness of the cube as well as a playable version of the Rubik's Cube. The game features seven other short puzzle games that are inspired by the style of the Rubik's Cube. A few of these puzzle games are similar to other puzzle games like ChuChu Rocket, Boom Blox, and Panel de Pon. Some of the minigames featured in this game have been used later in another Two Tribes release, Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: Rush (Wiiware).", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 28, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Two Tribes Publishing", "publishers": "The Game Factory", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Puzzle_World", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JFj2PYKp4M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82117-rubiks-world\n"}
