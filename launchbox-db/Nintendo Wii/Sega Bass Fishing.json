{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sega Bass Fishing", "overview": "Sega Bass Fishing is an arcade fishing game where players attempt to hook and reel in fish with different lures. It uses a fishing rod controller. Consisting of four stages at different times of the day, the game requires the player to catch a certain weight of fish within a time limit in order to move onto the next stage. The final stage allows only for one fish to be captured, but are among the largest in the game and most difficult to catch. Fish are measured under four weight classes: Small One, Average, Big One, and Huge. An enhanced port of the game was released for the Wii on February 26, 2008. The game utilizes the motion controls of the Wii Remote and optionally the Nunchuck to replicate the Sega Fishing Controller. The game's graphics have been enhanced and it includes the modes, features, stages and unlockables found in the Dreamcast version. The Wii version also introduces seven more stages, bringing the number to fifteen. Arcade mode now consists of courses, with the final course unlocking the original four arcade stages. Nature Trip mode is also introduced, allowing players to practice without the background music playing.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 26, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Cavia", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Bass_Fishing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcqnXIasqnc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4733-sega-bass-fishing\n"}
