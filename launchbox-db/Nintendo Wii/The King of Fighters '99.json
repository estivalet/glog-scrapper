{"altername_name": ["The King of Fighters '99 (Wii Virtual Console)"], "name": "The King of Fighters '99", "overview": "Originally released in 1999, this is the 6th installment in the King of Fighters series. This time, there is a new protagonist with an all-new story. Instead of the previous 3-member team format, now teams have 4 members, where 3 members actually fight and 1 member is designated as a \"Striker\". As in previous versions, you can unleash Super Special Moves when the gauges fill up. However, a new feature has been introduced whereby using 3 power stocks allows you to execute either Counter Mode, which increases offensive strength, or Armor Mode, which increases defensive strength. Tactics that apply to each situation have also been powered up. King of Fighters 99 boasts 32 playable characters. Do you think you have what it takes to reach the top?", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "May 16, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "D4 Enterprise", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Fighters_%2799", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158930-the-king-of-fighters-99\n"}
