{"altername_name": ["Moebius Drive"], "name": "Mobius Drive", "overview": "\"Mobius Drive\" is a racing game where you manipulate powerful and unique carts and race battle with rivals. You can enjoy 'Grand Prix' aiming at winning the race by winning the circuit and winning 'match-up race' where you can enjoy 2 players with other players, 'Wi-Fi match' where up to 8 people can play with Nintendo Wi-Fi connection . Circuits that appear are becoming a powerful layout that is always unpredictable due to severe up-down like a roller coaster and gimmicks with undulations and corners fluctuating while driving. Leverage techniques such as drift and turbo to brilliantly overtake the rival's pursuits that appear one after another and aim for the fastest goal. Your driving will be counted as a driver's point and you can also get the title and compete in the national rankings. Please enjoy \"unexperienced running feeling\" that simple and innovative operation with Wii remote control produces!
