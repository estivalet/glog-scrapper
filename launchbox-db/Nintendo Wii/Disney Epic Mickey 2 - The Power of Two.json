Return to the Wasteland, the alternate Disney reality filled with forgotten characters and out-of-use attractions. Play as Mickey Mouse and, for the first time, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Walt Disney's first cartoon star, in a fully-voiced adventure. Explore levels based on Disney films, using your imagination to solve puzzles with Mickey's magic paintbrush and Oswald's electricity-controlling remote. How you choose to solve the puzzles affects how the story unfolds. A second player can drop in any time for co-op play and, in true Disney tradition, the characters will occasionally expand the story by singing songs.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 18, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Junction Point", "publishers": "Disney", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Mickey_2:_The_Power_of_Two", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH9Kx06oO_0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12955-disney-epic-mickey-2-the-power-of-two\n"}
