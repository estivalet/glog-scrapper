The original is a golf manga produced by Japanese cartoonist Fujiko Fujio A. The protagonist is often called \"ape\" because he looks like a monkey. In the game version, players have to compete with assassins organized by Shadow Golf in the natural environment. The various nirvana skills that appeared in the original work also have a very gorgeous performance in the game. Using the somatosensory operation of the Wii remote control, players will be able to experience a very realistic feeling of hitting the ball during the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 23, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138246-pro-golfer-saru\n"}
