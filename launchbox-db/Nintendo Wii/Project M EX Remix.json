{"altername_name": ["PMEX REMIX"], "name": "Project M EX Remix", "overview": "Project M EX REMIX, or PMEX REMIX for short, is a game mod of Super Smash Bros. Brawl in the vein of the original Project M, building on each of its characters while adding many veterans from Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate along with many, many new faces. In what can basically be considered the culmination of the Brawl modding scene over 12 years, PMEX REMIX features a whopping 116 fighters - that's 27 more than Ultimate's final count of 89 at the end of its DLC development in October 2021 - from across Nintendo's franchises and beyond, all while incorporating the in-depth competitive mechanics of Super Smash Bros. Melee. In short? It's the ultimate Super Smash Bros. jam session, bringing together the best character, stage and music mods from across the community into one enormous package. If Smash as a whole is the definitive Massive Multiplayer Crossover of video game history, REMIX is the definitive Massive Multiplayer Crossover of Brawl mods.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168027-project-m-ex-remix\n"}
