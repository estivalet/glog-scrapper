{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guitar Hero: Metallica", "overview": "Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game in the Guitar Hero series to focus on specific band, following the release of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 29, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Budcat Creations", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero:_Metallica", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZL1pEUiooY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8966-guitar-hero-metallica\n"}
