{"altername_name": ["PictureBook Games: A Pop-Up Adventure", "Asoberu Ehon Tobida Sugoroku!"], "name": "PictureBook Games: Pop-Up Pursuit", "overview": "With its unique setting and artistic style, Pop-Up Pursuit is a family board game unlike any other! Enter the world of PictureBook Games: Pop-Up Pursuit, and enjoy a family board game set in a pop-up picture book. Instead of simply rolling dice to move along the map though, you use cards (that can help or hinder progress) and coins (useful for buying more cards, but don\u2019t forget about your Coin Bonus at the end of the game). In addition, you\u2019ll find that the spaces on the map play an important role in the game\u2019s outcome and that your computer-controlled opponents exhibit different personalities and behavior. And if that\u2019s not enough, the mysterious Book of Magick will occasionally be opened, causing an event to occur\u2014which may change according to how you play. This mixture of exciting game play combined with a charming and artistic atmosphere gives Pop-Up Pursuit high replay value and a unique depth\u2014even if its characters are flat!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 26, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "h.a.n.d.", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PictureBook_Games:_Pop-Up_Pursuit", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73425-picturebook-games-pop-up-pursuit\n"}
