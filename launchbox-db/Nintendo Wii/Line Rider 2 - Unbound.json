{"altername_name": ["Line Rider Freestyle"], "name": "Line Rider 2: Unbound", "overview": "The physics-based Internet \"toy\" that evolved into a full-fledged online phenomenon gets turned into a legitimate game in Line Rider 2: Unbound. Where the original \"Line Rider\" combined elements of art and level design to create something of a sledding game, Line Rider 2 keeps the original features intact and adds a story element. Gamers take on the role of Bosh as he sleds through 40 courses, battling his rival Chaz in an attempt to earn the ultimate sled and the affections of the beautiful Bailey. Gamers also have more options when creating their own courses thanks to 15 new line types, new editing tools that allow for colored backgrounds and easier curve design, and on-the-fly real-time drawing. Proud designers can then record their tracks to video and share them online.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 7, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "inXile Entertainment", "publishers": "Deep Silver", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOsBeN37Vso", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14139-line-rider-2-unbound\n"}
