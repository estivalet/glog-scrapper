{"altername_name": ["Cosy Fire"], "name": "Cozy Fire", "overview": "We all long for a cozy open fire, particularly during the cold season, but not everyone is able to snuggle in front of a warming blaze. The WiiWare service opens the door for a fireplace to fill the room with a magical and cozy atmosphere! Select from a variety of logs and use the Wii Remote controller to stack them up. Now, light a virtual match and your home will soon be snug and glowing. There are 6 fireplaces available: fire alone, campfire and rustic, classic, elegant and Zen fireplaces. Poke and tend the fire to keep it burning. Place more logs on the fire to keep the fire burning, just like a real fire. Would you like to just sit back and relax? No problem: new logs will be placed on the fire in Butler mode, and the logs never burn down in Non-stop mode! What could be nicer than the comforting crackle and animation of a real fire, during the coldest time of the year!
