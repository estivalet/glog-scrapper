{"altername_name": ["Thor: Dios del Trueno"], "name": "Thor: God of Thunder", "overview": "Thor on Wii gets a lot of things right. The core combat mechanic works well, even if many of your move options don\u2019t seem necessary. It\u2019s easy to get big chain attacks going, resulting in some flashy moves and a feeling that you truly are kicking some ass. Despite that, Thor is a mixed affair. Level design is unimaginably dull, and boss encounters are too far apart to be rewarding. Visually the game struggles, as well, with a streamlined graphical approach failing to hold off a staggeringly inconsistent framerate and other awkward glitches. That\u2019s really a shame.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 3, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Red Fly Studio", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor:_God_of_Thunder", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpLSeJrb1lM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8875-thor-god-of-thunder\n"}
