Platforming is the beating heart of Ubisoft\u2019s crisp, charming riff on Spielberg\u2019s recent film. The subtlety and nuance of the cast\u2019s movements, from daring leaps to nose-smashing right-hooks, is an artistic delight that keeps the sidescrolling action consistently engaging, even if it does turn out to have more ideas than its slender runtime can cope with.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 6, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Ubisoft", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.37", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7982-the-adventures-of-tintin-the-game\n"}
