{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crystal Defenders R1", "overview": "In a land ruled by might and magic, peace is ensured by the benevolent power of the crystals. In CRYSTAL DEFENDERS R1, you must deploy various units such as Soldiers and Black Mages to stop wave after wave of encroaching monsters from escaping the area with your party's crystals. There are many different types of units to choose from, some specializing in powerful short-range attacks, some wielding far-reaching magicks, and still others equipped with bows, enabling them to bring down aerial foes. Deploy units in strategic locations to take full advantage of their traits. Each time an enemy breaches your defenses and reaches a map's exit, your party will lose crystals. When all your crystals are gone, the game is over. CRYSTAL DEFENDERS R1 comes complete with a plethora of exciting stages, each varying in layout and difficulty. Can you defend them all without losing a single crystal?", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 11, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Defenders#Releases", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72039-crystal-defenders-r1\n"}
