{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rock Band: Metal Track Pack", "overview": "Rock Band Track Pack: Metal is a standalone software product that allows owners of Rock Band and Rock Band 2 to keep on rocking with more hit songs from the pantheon of rock music. In addition, Rock Band Track Pack: Metal, like all Rock Band software, is compatible with all Rock Band instrument controllers and other current music-based video game peripherals. Summoning power from the metal gods on high, the Rock Band team has assembled 20 on-disc tracks exploding with bone-crushing, ear-lashing, face-melting metal including anvil-heavy cuts from Godsmack, Children of Bodom, Evile, Judas Priest, Bullet For My Valentine and more! Six of the on disc tracks are brand new to the Rock Band platform via this package. (Fans who buy the Rock Band Metal Track Pack can play directly from the disc or download the songs onto their consoles' hard drives through a free online offer -- once downloaded, the songs will automatically appear in the player's custom Rock Band library and can be integrated into setlists and played in all game modes of various Rock Band editions.)", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "September 22, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Demiurge Studios", "publishers": "MTV Games", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rock_Band_track_packs#Rock_Band_Metal_Track_Pack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23890-rock-band-metal-track-pack\n"}
