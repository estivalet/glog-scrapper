{"altername_name": ["Goo no Wakusei"], "name": "World of Goo", "overview": "Part adventure puzzle, part physics-based construction sim, World of Goo is a quirky game in which players must build geometric structures by connecting small droplets of \"goo.\" The premise is that players transport a specified number of droplets from the starting point to a pipe that serves as the goal, with leftover droplets automatically traveling along the completed pathway. Challenges come in the form of realistic gravity and weather conditions that change with each season, and as the game progresses players will encounter helpful tools, level-based pitfalls, and a number of different colored droplets, each offering unique levels of elasticity and a finite number of re-connections.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 13, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "2D Boy", "publishers": "2D Boy", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A_JfkzPwww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8950-world-of-goo\n"}
