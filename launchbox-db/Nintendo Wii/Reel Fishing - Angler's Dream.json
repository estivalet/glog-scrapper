{"altername_name": ["Fish Eyes Wii"], "name": "Reel Fishing: Angler's Dream", "overview": "Gamers head off to tranquil lakes and sandy beaches in an effort to wrangle more than 40 different kinds of fish in Reel Fishing: Angler's Dream. The game takes advantage of the Wii's motion-sensitive controls to let players cast and reel just as they would in real life, and each of the 40 fish species fights and flees like its real-world counterpart. When gamers are satisfied with their catch they can head back to the lodge, where the Fishing Master doles out expert advice and showcases the new equipment players have earned. Angler's Dream also strays into life development sim territory, because the lodge includes a number of aquariums where gamers can care for and rear their most prized catches. The ultimate goal for solo players is to track down the rare and elusive Legendary Fish, but those looking for multiplayer action can join up to three friends in the competitive \"Versus\" mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "May 30, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SIMS", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18868-reel-fishing-anglers-dream\n"}
