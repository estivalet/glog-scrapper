Each team consists of a team captain (Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, and more), three sidekicks (ranging from Koopa Troopas to Hammer Bros.), and a Kremling goalkeeper. Besides the usual soccer moves like passing the ball or tackling another player, the team captains can perform Mega Strike shots which can be stopped by the opponent's keeper by pointing the Wii Remote at the ball. Throughout each game, the player receives items like bananas or bombs used to hinder the opponent. There are also unique character items for each team captain. For example, Mario will temporarily grow to Super Mario to crush his opponents. The game features various stadiums each with their own environment, and several game modes. In Domination Mode, up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can battle each other in a user-defined number of rounds of a certain length. There is also a cup mode called \"Road to the Striker cup\" where the player and other teams battle each other to win one of the three cups. It is the first Wii game in Europe with an online multiplayer mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "July 30, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Next Level Games", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Strikers_Charged", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_MWHeuO-6g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7360-mario-strikers-charged\n"}
