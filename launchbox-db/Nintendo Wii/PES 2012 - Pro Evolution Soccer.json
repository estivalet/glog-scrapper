{"altername_name": ["Winning Eleven: Play Maker 2012"], "name": "PES 2012: Pro Evolution Soccer", "overview": "PES 2012: Pro Evolution Soccer is a soccer game in which the player directly controls the athletes. In various playing modes the player takes control over a team to dominate the match. This includes a mode where a single athlete is controlled, the league in which additional management jobs are undertaken and a training mode. New in this version is the club boss mode with even more tasks to take care of. The direct pass system, introduced in a former installment of the series, has now five settings so new players can slowly accustom to them. Besides a few new graphical effects, the main improvements are regarding AI and controls, most notably the possibility to manually control a second athlete of the own team. The license package is mostly the same as in the predecessor with a few additional teams.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 15, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15725-pes-2012-pro-evolution-soccer\n"}
