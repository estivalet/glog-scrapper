{"altername_name": [], "name": "Let's Tap", "overview": "Let's Tap consists of a number of minigames that requires the player to tap a flat surface with their hands to play. The game requires the player to set the Wii Remote face-side down on a flat, stable surface, with the accelerometer picking up their vibrations as they tap the surface to move an on screen character in a race, inflate a balloon, create ripples in a pool of water or paint swirls on a canvas.[3] In a video released by Sega the player is shown resting the Wii Remote on an empty box originally used to package the Wii console.[4] In Japan and Europe Sega released the game with two foldout cardboard boxes that players are able to use as a tapping surface,[5] but these are not included in the North American package.[6]", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 18, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Prope", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17497-lets-tap\n"}
