Match warriors from Fatal Fury against favorites from its sister series, Art of Fighting. Or see if the casts of the Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier series better suit your fighting style. Plus, there\u2019s a set of brand- new characters, exclusive to the KOF series, that are willing to join the fray. But there\u2019s a twist\u2014instead of the standard best best-two- out- of- three- rounds fight setup, players choose one of eight teams, each made up of three teammates. To win, all members of the other team must be eliminated before your fighters are knocked out. Use the game\u2019s power gauge to inflict maximum damage and end the round with a devastating finishing move. It\u2019s a battle royal unlike anything else\u2014a game whose inspiration is easily seen in the fighting games that followed it. Can your team be the last one standing?", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "January 7, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "D4 Enterprise", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Fighters_%2794", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158924-the-king-of-fighters-94\n"}
