{"altername_name": [], "name": "Agent Hugo: Hula Holiday", "overview": "Agent Hugo: Hula Holiday is a 3D platform game staring Hugo the TV troll that is played from a behind view perspective. While on vacation Agent Hugo notices that a big fly with his robotic trash cans is transforming a nearby island into a dump, in order to feed his fly army. Gameplay includes platforming and defeating trash cans. Killing enemies can be done with a tail sweep. A tail sweep can also be used to activate screw switches for doors. Sometimes a bubble gun can be used to shoot at distant enemies, trapping them helplessly inside floating soap-bubbles, until they can be eliminated with a tail-sweep at close range.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 6, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Attractive Games", "publishers": "NDS Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1XvZqIEy_I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102501-agent-hugo-hula-holiday\n"}
