{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan Wii", "overview": "(Google Translated from Japanese WiiWare page) The rules are easy. Just link words and make words. Because it carries a dictionary of 130 thousand words, it also happens that words that I do not know can be made, and unexpected fulfillment will happen. In addition to the traditional \"battle with two people\", fighting functions such as \"fighting with computer\" and the first series of \"Wi-Fi battle\" are enriched. The number of stages is 200 for one person, a large volume of 50 matches.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bandai Namco", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotoba_no_Puzzle:_Mojipittan", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75731-kotoba-no-puzzle-mojipittan-wii\n"}
