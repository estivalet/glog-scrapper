{"altername_name": [], "name": "Physio Fun: Pelvic Floor Training", "overview": "We would like to help you train your pelvic floor with our 30-day Pelvic Floor Training programme. Pelvic Floor Training Physiofun was developed in cooperation with Thomas Claus and the doctors of the Dr. Becker Klinikgesellschaft. It is aimed at assisting you in locating and training your pelvic floor. A strong and healthy pelvic floor fulfils numerous functions - it can even help to improve posture and provide positive impulses for your life. You will see that a well-trained pelvic floor is also good for your general body feeling. If you have just had your baby you can do special exercises together with your child. Not only is this fun and promotes bonding with your child, it can also be effective for your entire musculature and, of course, for your pelvic floor.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "April 8, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kaasa Health GmbH", "publishers": "Kaasa Health GmbH", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WiiWare_games", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78332-physio-fun-pelvic-floor-training\n"}
