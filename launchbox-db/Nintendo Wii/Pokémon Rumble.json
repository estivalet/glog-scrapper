{"altername_name": ["Pokemon Rumble", "Pokemon Rumble", "Ransen! Pokemon Scramble"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Rumble", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Rumble is an action game in which you control Pok\u00e9mon and take on wave after wave of other Pok\u00e9mon in a variety of stages. You can befriend some of the defeated Pok\u00e9mon along the way, which lets you add them to your collection and grants you the ability to use them in battle. Switch between collected Pok\u00e9mon at any time, taking advantage of the fact that the amount of damage you deal depends on the type of move used and the type of Pok\u00e9mon hit. Be the last one standing to gain the right to compete in the Battle Royale and test your skills against many Pok\u00e9mon at once. You can also team up with three people for some multiplayer action (additional Wii Remote controllers required), working together to take down tough Bosses and earning points that can be used toward recruiting or training Pok\u00e9mon. You can even save your favorite Pok\u00e9mon to your Wii Remote controller for exchanges with friends. Combining beautiful cel-shaded graphics and exciting game-play features, this is one rumble you won't want to miss.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 16, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Ambrella", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Rumble", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23785-pokemon-rumble\n"}
