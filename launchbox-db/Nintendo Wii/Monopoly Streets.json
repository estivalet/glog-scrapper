{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monopoly Streets", "overview": "Monopoly Streets reinvigorates the classic game of fortune in a whole new format. Explore the streets of your favorite town as you journey from the cheap motels of Baltic Avenue to the ritzy Boardwalk suites and more. Watch your fortunes rise and fall as your player headquarters change from a luxurious mansion to a dilapidated hut - and back, if you're lucky. Feeling competitive? Use your street smarts to auction off your properties and break your rivals' banks, or even challenge players worldwide in exciting online play. You set the standards with the opportunity to set and save house rules - play longer, shorter or whatever way you want. Play in classic game mode, explore new game twists in Monopoly City and Monument City or download extra themed boards and tokens online for changing adventures that keep you passing \"Go\" over and over again. Jump into the excitement of this classic game but watch out - once you reach the top, there's nowhere to go but back down.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 25, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hasbro", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_Streets", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfPTMamn4k0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8141-monopoly-streets\n"}
