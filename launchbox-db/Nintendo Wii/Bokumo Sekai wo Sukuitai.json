In addition, we have a simulation mode to watch over the activity of the brave person who made it. In \"breeding mode\", the parts such as moving experience and battle with fish enemies are progressing in a simplified, adventure format, covering factors such as earning experience value, money earnings, purchase of equipment, events, party formation, etc. . In the \"simulation mode\", you can watch how the activity will be carried out by sending the hero who made yourself to such a world that the demon wants to conquer the world and the hero aims to beat the demon king. You can register more than one brave, you can register multiple heros made by you or register the hero of another player by exchanging passwords of the brave person who you raised. While enjoying the process of making your favorite brave, please see how the brave man works and how it intertwines with the brave made by others.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 29, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Poisoft", "publishers": "Poisoft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WiiWare_games#Released_titles", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71838-bokumo-sekai-wo-sukuitai\n"}
