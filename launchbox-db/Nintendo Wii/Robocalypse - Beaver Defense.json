{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robocalypse: Beaver Defense", "overview": "Penned by the writers of the tongue-in-cheek SpongeBob Squarepants series, Robocalypse - Beaver Defense offers madcap weaponry and uproarious destruction in a \u201ctower defence\u201d style game. Set in a world of wise-cracking, battling robots, players must create and strategically position static and mobile defences to stop the waves of enemies that are intent on destroying the player\u2019s HQ. Place defences before the start of each level and prepare for the enemy\u2019s onslaught! Each successive wave of enemies is tougher, so the choice and positioning of defences is essential. The storyline follows the exploits of a wronged, mutated beaver, bent on exacting his revenge. Not only do players build static towers to stop the beaver-sent robot-onslaught, they also directly control one of several mobile and super-tough hero robots, the Thermidoom company\u2019s pride and joy. Heroes can use anything from dual chain-guns to flame throwers to fortify their HQ. These moving weapons can then be upgraded as they gain experience, becoming even more powerful fighting machines.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "May 31, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Vogster Entertainment", "publishers": "Vogster Entertainment", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocalypse:_Beaver_Defense", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73500-robocalypse-beaver-defense\n"}
