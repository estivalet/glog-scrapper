{"altername_name": ["Sesame Street: Cookie's Counting Carnival: The Videogame"], "name": "Sesame Street: Cookie's Counting Carnival", "overview": "In Cookie's Counting Carnival, kids head to the Carnival with Cookie Monster and Big Bird to learn about numbers, counting, colors and pattern recognition by playing educational mini-games. These mini-games are accessed by taking a tour of the amusement park and visiting its various attractions, such as The Grandstand, Rides, Midway, Food Court, Petting Zoo, and so on. Alternatively, a separate mode allows to directly select and play the desired mini-game, without going through the entire carnival.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 19, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "EC - Early Childhood", "developers": "Black Lantern Studios", "publishers": "Warner Bros.
