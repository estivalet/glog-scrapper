Aware of his people\u2019s distress, the king calls on his two sons, William and Edward, to acquire new territories in order to produce enough goods to satisfy the needs of his empire\u2019s inhabitants. Whereas Edward suggests aggressive means to collect the precious resources, his brother William offers a peaceful solution, proposing to explore new and unsettled lands in the south of the kingdom. With his Father\u2019s blessing, William heads south to the mysterious Orient and returns with valuable new technologies such as the water pump that allows dry lands to be cultivated in order to produce enough food for the people. But there are still many unmet needs within the king\u2019s empire, and players are tasked with the mission of fulfilling those needs while both expanding and sustaining the vast society.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 6, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Keen Games", "publishers": "Ubisoft Entertainment", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno:_Create_A_New_World", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368901-dawn-of-discovery\n"}
