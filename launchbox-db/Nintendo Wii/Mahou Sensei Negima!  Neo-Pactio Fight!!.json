Certain attacks and moves involving quickly moving the Wii Remote left and right or up and down. By getting a Pactio Card, one can activate a Pactio transformation like in Negima!?, randomly (though possible to control) becoming one of the three different forms: Armor (powerful version of your character, using a very powerful attack), Cosplay (character dresses up in costumes, and boosts the characters abilities), and Suka (or \"Miss\", in which your character is transformed into a weak super-deformed animal, such as a Kappa in Kaede's case). The art style of the game (as well as many of its characters' moves) is based on the second Negima TV series Negima!?, and not on the original manga by Ken Akamatsu or the first anime. In between fights, cut-scenes done in the style of Negima!? are shown, featuring voice-acting from the seiyuu of both anime adaptations.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 14, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "publishers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131933-mahou-sensei-negima-neo-pactio-fight\n"}
