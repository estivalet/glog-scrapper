{"altername_name": [], "name": "Create", "overview": "The game consists of an interactive main hub which spans into ten themed stages, (such as Theme Park and Transportopia) and a bonus stage. In each stage there are ten challenges to conquer. Each challenge falls into a category depending on its objective. Each category consists of using certain objects to reach a goal/target (Pickup Party), by racking up a massive score by using several items at once (Scoretacular) or even building their own machine out of blocks, girders, wheels and hinges (Contraption-o-Matic). Upon completing a challenge, the player will unlock 'Creative Sparks'. Each Spark will reward the player with an item to use in challenges or to their own devices, props to place in their scenery etc. To access items, the player must use the main interface which comprises Game Objects (These are used in challenges or can be played with), Brush Tools (These are used to colour each scene), Environment (The player may decorate the sky, add music and weather effects etc.), World Tools (Used to decorate the scenery with props) and options to Reset Creation and Save Creation. The game also allows plenty of free will for the player, as they may have a break from challenges and play with the items which they have unlocked.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 16, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "EA Bright Light", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzwIo7HSVKI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9028-create\n"}
