As legendary hero Link, you must journey across Hyrule, and even through time itself, to thwart the plans of Ganondorf. You\u2019ll wield weapons and gadgets, battle enormous bosses and solve brain-busting puzzles, which are among the best ever seen in the Zelda series. Ocarina of Time brilliantly adapted the 2D, top-down style of classic Zelda adventures into 3D, becoming a textbook example of game design that is still followed today. But the appeal of \u2018Ocarina\u2019 lies not only in its cinematic visuals or groundbreaking combat system; it also impresses with its epic storyline, memorable characters, superbly designed dungeons and rich variety of gameplay. Quite simply, it\u2019s a masterpiece!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 26, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162348-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time\n"}
