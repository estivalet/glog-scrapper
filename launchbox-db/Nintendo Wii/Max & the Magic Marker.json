{"altername_name": ["Rakugaki Hero"], "name": "Max & the Magic Marker", "overview": "Did you ever dream your pictures were real? In this game they are! One day Max gets a mysterious marker in the mail. Not knowing better, the first thing he draws is a wacky, purple monster. But as soon as the marker leaves the paper, the monster comes to life and jumps off the paper and into another drawing. With the monster on the loose and messing with Max's drawings, Max has no choice but to go after it. Armed with the awesome weapon of the magic marker, you must follow the monster through fifteen inventive and challenging levels. However, you will need more than good will and quick reflexes to tackle the challenges ahead. With the magic marker you will freely draw inside the game to help Max defeat enemies, overcome obstacles, and solve puzzles.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "January 22, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Press Play", "publishers": "Press Play", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_%26_the_Magic_Marker", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73385-max-the-magic-marker\n"}
