{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boingz", "overview": "Bend, stretch and flick your way to freedom! Stretch, flex, and flick your way to freedom! A truly mind-bending experience, Boingz introduces you to cute, colorful, stretchable friends lost in an alien world, searching for the magical gates that will take them home. Boingz springs to life with 30 levels of puzzle-platforming fun. The Boingz are bendy little critters that can be pulled, stretched, and flicked from place to place like rubber bands. It's a team effort, as all the Boingz will have to work together to unwind the game's puzzles. What's more, many of the Boingz have fallen into a deep slumber, and you'll have to lead the stronger Boingz to find and wake up their sleepy friends. Explore surreal landscapes, sail through the air like a trapeze artist, walk along the seafloor, and collect the Twinklies to power up your elastic-powered flights!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 24, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "NinjaBee", "publishers": "RealArcade", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boingz", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71825-boingz\n"}
