Here, it is the regular, classic \"Amazing\" Spider-Man, and Spider-Man 2099 \u2013 in a story awash in time travel, temporal battles, and Anti-Venom. The backbone of this story seems to play out more like a Spider-Man 2099 story, since he is the only character truly aware of the happenings in the game, and the changes that both Spider-Men encounter.
