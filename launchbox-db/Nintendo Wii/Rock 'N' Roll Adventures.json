{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rock 'N' Roll Adventures", "overview": "Rock 'n' Roll Adventures is a platforming video game developed and published by Data Design Interactive and Conspiracy Entertainment. The game was released in Europe on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Wii on 17 September 2007 and in North America on 11 October 2007. The game has received poor reception. Like Ninjabread Man, there are 3 levels, plus a tutorial. In the tutorial level, the game will show the player what controls to use. For the rest of the levels, the player must collect all 8 Power Rods. The enemies of the game are drum parts like cymbals. The game uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Jerking the Nunchuk up allows the player to jump. Swinging the Wii Remote swings the player's guitar.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 11, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Data Design Interactive", "publishers": "Conspiracy Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Adventures", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZUUPis9ZmP0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45225-rock-n-roll-adventures\n"}
