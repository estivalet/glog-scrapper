{"altername_name": [], "name": "Doc Louis's Punch-Out!!", "overview": "Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! is a three-tier sampling of the Punch-Out!! gameplay, but with Doc Louis as your opponent. The game starts out in \"Warm up\" which is really just a clever way to say \"Easy Mode.\" Here, the Punch-Out!! gameplay begins for the Novice \u2013 Doc telegraphs all his moves just like the Punch-Out!! opponents, but since he's on your side he actually tells you what to do with verbal commands. \"Duck this one!\" \"Block this!\" \"Dodge!\" He'll get roughed up, showing physical damage as you beat him up throughout the three rounds. There are no TKOs as Doc will stop the fight after being whittled down to no health. \"Training\" is the second mode, which is really a \"medium difficulty\" mode. Doc is faster and has different moves. And he'll save himself mid-round with a bite from a candy bar. If you manage to get through this mode, \"Sparring\" will unlock, and this is where Doc really shows his stuff\u2026including a crazy Star Power move.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 27, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Next Level Games", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Out!!_(Wii)#Doc_Louis.27s_Punch-Out.21.21", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kl-1AQxdVo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33246-doc-louiss-punch-out\n"}
