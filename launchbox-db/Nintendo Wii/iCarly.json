{"altername_name": ["Nickelodeon iCarly"], "name": "iCarly", "overview": "In the iCarly videogame, the possibilities are truly endless as players help Carly, Sam, Freddie and the other characters from the hit TV series craft all-new webisodes of the show in an original storyline designed specifically for the game. Fun and frenetic mini-games, presented as show skits, capture the creativity of the series, and allow players to work with the characters through new adventures. The innovative iCreate mode provides opportunities for gamers to add their own touches to the webisodes by swapping out props, characters, color schemes, audio, intros, outros and more. Up to four players can either compete or cooperate together on Wii to complete the skits and earn Web-Cred, which can then be used to purchase new items, props, accessories and locations from in-game websites.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 5, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Blitz Games Studio", "publishers": "Activision Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICarly_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QNvuiusw8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82208-icarly\n"}
