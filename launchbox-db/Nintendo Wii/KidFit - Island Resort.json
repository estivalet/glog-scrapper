Travel to the Kid Fit Island Resort and take a vacation from boring exercise. Choose from ten activities, all with a fun island theme. Get your heart rate going with a sprint to win treasure, a race to build a sand castle, or a dance around a bonfire. Catch some air leaping over the water in the Long Jump or swinging through the treetops in Vine Swing. Practice your balance by surfing or log rolling, and more. Each activity can be enjoyed alone, head-to-head, or in Party Mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 5, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Teyon", "publishers": "Red Wagon Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119679-kidfit-island-resort\n"}
