This game is developed in the style of Just Dance 3, but lacks some of its features such as unlockable songs and the shop. Like in Just Dance Wii, song lyrics are highlighted light blue when a male is singing and light pink when a female is singing, or both if a male and a female are singing together. This game also includes Dance Dojo, where the player can skip back and forth through a song in order to learn it better.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "July 26, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ubisoft Paris", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163457-just-dance-wii-2\n"}
