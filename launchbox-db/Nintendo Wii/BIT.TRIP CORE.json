BIT.TRIP CORE continues the BIT.TRIP saga in this retro-arcade-style game. BIT.TRIP CORE adds up to an exciting action/rhythm game that\u2019s best played while zoning out on the tunes and letting the visuals swallow you whole. The experience is inspired by games from the \u201880s, only with a modern twist. The game play is entirely new to the series, leaving the single-axis controls of BIT.TRIP BEAT behind in favor of the ability to control two axes. If the difficulty gets you down, grab a friend and play cooperatively with two-player multiplayer. Make it to the end and you\u2019ll have journeyed one step further to completing your BIT.TRIP.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "July 6, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gaijin Entertainment", "publishers": "Aksys Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit.Trip_Core", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71818-bittrip-core\n"}
