{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Climber Wii", "overview": "Crazy Climber made its debut in the early 1980s in the arcade. The concept of this innovative game is simple, the player takes on the role of a skyscraper climber and aim to board the helicopter at the top of the building. Although the concept is simple, the game itself is very challenging as there are many obstacles that you have to overcome to reach the top. Window shutters open and close to break your hand holds, residents of the building attempt to kill you by throwing flower pots and other heavy stuff at you. And as you climb higher and higher, you will come across monsters that are living on the buildings and think it's fun to swing themselves at you and see you drop to your death. 25 years later, this classic game is remade for the Nintendo Wii console. With your Wiimote control in one hand and the nunchaku in the other, you are ready to attempt to break your (or your player character's) neck from the comfort of your living room. The game offers four characters to choose from and a vast amount of carefully sculpted high rises for your climbing pleasure. The demented residents are back to throw things at you and so are the monsters. Playing alone generates a huge amount of fun, but you can also play this game at a party with a group of friends. The one person mode offers a set of six fixed stages and an unlimited amount of stages thereafter, while the group mode supports four stages and one secret stage.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 20, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon System", "publishers": "Nihon System", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131931-crazy-climber-wii\n"}
