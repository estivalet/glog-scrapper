{"altername_name": ["Schweine Party", "Farmyard Party", "Athletic Piggy Party", "Farmland Party"], "name": "Party Pigs: Farmyard Games", "overview": "Party Pigs: Farmyard Games (released as both Farmland Party and Atlantic Piggy Party in Europe) is a mini-game collection where pigs participate in eight different sports events: the 100 metres dash, the 110 metres hurdles, long jump, high jump, hammer toss, javelin throw, 100 metres swim and the high dive. Players can choose between six pigs: Brutus, Ginger, Maximus, Norris, Randy and Rasher, only providing an aesthetic difference that does not affect abilities. There are three difficulty levels and the game is set in a farm environment. All events use a combination of the Wii Remote and sometimes the Nunchuk based on speed, stamina and timing to do well, for instance by moving the controller quickly or according to a certain rhythm to run, flicking it for a jump, or moving the Wii Remote in a circular motion for the hammer toss for instance. Next to single-player games against AI-controlled opponents, local multiplayer is supported for up to four players. In addition to single events there are group games and special games where more content can be unlocked, such as additional games or a development gallery.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "September 30, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Data Design Interactive", "publishers": "Destineer", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIh-3u4srno", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82501-party-pigs-farmyard-games\n"}
