{"altername_name": [], "name": "ColorZ", "overview": "Take the ColorZ challenge! With ColorZ, set forth in your spaceships on a mission to clean up virus-infested planets. Immerse yourself in a new gameplay experience that will reveal mind-hand-eye coordination skills you never knew you had! Absorb viruses of your own color, but steer clear of the others. If you need to, you can cleverly merge your ships together to create new colors. Buzz past your enemies to keep your combo and clock up a new high-score record. Explore an extra dimension to the game with the multi-player mode and share the unique experience of cooperative play between friends. Pool your forces, synchronize your movements, and become a unified team (of up to 3 players) to meet the challenge together!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "September 7, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Exkee", "publishers": "Exkee", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColorZ", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72034-colorz\n"}
