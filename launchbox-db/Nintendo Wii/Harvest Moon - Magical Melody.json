{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harvest Moon: Magical Melody", "overview": "A farming simulation and adventure game. Choose to play as a girl or a boy and start life in a farming village with the goal of becoming an expert farm manager. Taking over your own farm, you raise plants and animals, catch lots of fish, build up your farm, and see your character grow into adulthood. The game features cows, horses and sheep, among other animals, but this time around, if you don't have a gate around their grazing area, they may get out from your farm area and, when night comes, get attacked by wild dogs. You also have added freedom with your planting, as you can now raise plants outside your own farm area. Once again, interacting with town folk and falling in love are major points of the game. Your choice of love interests changes depending on your choice of boy or girl at the start of the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "August 25, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon:_Magical_Melody", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14510-harvest-moon-magical-melody\n"}
