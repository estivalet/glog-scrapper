{"altername_name": [], "name": "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011", "overview": "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown. One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 26, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Yuke's", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown_vs._Raw_2011", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UmHlvE58lI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7450-wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2011\n"}
