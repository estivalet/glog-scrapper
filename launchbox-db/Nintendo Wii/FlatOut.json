{"altername_name": [], "name": "FlatOut", "overview": "In Flatout, making it to the finish line is not the only way to win. As long as no one else gets there either, things will work out just fine. Get behind the wheel of rust-bucket racers practically begging to be destroyed in all-out, over-the-top racing. Finish first or just finish the competition by reducing their ride to a pile of scrap metal. Go beyond classic Flatout racing with new modes that offer even more destruction. High speeds and slow motion come together in Stuntman Mode. Survive your opponents and much worse in deathtrap-filled Arena Mode. And do as much damage as quickly as you can as in Trash Mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 23, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Team6 Game Studios", "publishers": "Zoo Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlatOut_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ChJR5caZiU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10431-flatout\n"}
