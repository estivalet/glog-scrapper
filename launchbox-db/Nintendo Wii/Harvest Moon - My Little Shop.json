You've just taken over your grandparents' farm and shop. The town has fallen on hard times, though. People are leaving, businesses are struggling, and the magic of the Harvest Sprites is gone. Can you turn Clover Town's fortunes around and restore its missing magic? Raise crops and animals, then use what you farm at your shop! Keep your customers happy by making wild fruit juices, towering ice cream cones, and extravagantly decorated eggs in a series of fun and fast-paced activities that use the Wii Remote controller to its fullest potential. Chop vegetables in midair, shake your Wii Remote controller to match your cow's moves, roll eggs through tilting mazes, and more! Use your hard-earned money to buy new crops and animals, and expand and decorate your shop. Along the way, you'll meet and befriend lots of new and interesting characters, as well as more than a few familiar faces from the Harvest Moon series!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "April 28, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon:_My_Little_Shop", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77767-harvest-moon-my-little-shop\n"}
