{"altername_name": ["Battle Rage: The Robot Wars"], "name": "Battle Rage: Mech Conflict", "overview": "Battle Rage is a third person shooter with elements of a beat'em'up game that allows a player to control giant robots. Battles between the robots take place on carefully selected battlegrounds (so called \"arenas\") and they are short, quick, brutal skirmishes. The player can fight alone (versus one, two or even three opponents) or in a team against a common foe. Every robot has its own weapons (for melee and distance combat), additional weapon types can be collected on the arena. The player can modify a robot's parameters in the single player mode as well as in the multiplayer to fit its possibilities to his/her own fighting style. Also many new, powerful robots will wait for the player to unlock in the story mode.
