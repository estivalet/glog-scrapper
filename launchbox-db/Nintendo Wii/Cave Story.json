{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cave Story", "overview": "Cave Story for WiiWare takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent, rabbit-like creatures called Mimiga run free. You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village, you discover that the once-carefree Mimiga are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. Their only hope rests squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name. Take control, learn the origins of this world's power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 22, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Studio Pixel", "publishers": "Nicalis", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Story", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14605-cave-story\n"}
