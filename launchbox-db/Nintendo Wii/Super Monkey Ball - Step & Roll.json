{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Monkey Ball: Step & Roll", "overview": "Super Monkey Ball: Step & Roll, like the previous Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz, is a fun ball-rolling design with a nice stack of challenges and a hit-or-miss pile of mini-games. There are some neat inclusions like the Super Mario Galaxy-like co-op mode where other players can shoot obstacles out of the players\u2019 way. The added balance board support wasn\u2019t that much of a selling point for me \u2013 on paper it sounds like a match made in heaven but in practice it\u2019s just a great big load of frustration. Skip the balance board support and you\u2019ll have a good time.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 11, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball:_Step_%26_Roll", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B-7x0LmWR8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8876-super-monkey-ball-step-roll\n"}
