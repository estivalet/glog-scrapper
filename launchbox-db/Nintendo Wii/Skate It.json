{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skate It", "overview": "Skate It is set between the events of Skate and Skate 2 in San Vanelona, the same fictional city as the original game, although several earthquakes have caused widespread damage and a mass evacuation of the city, leaving the player free to skate alone and undisturbed. They will, however, be able to travel to other cities in the world later in the game. Skate It is the only game in the series to not feature the main protagonist of the series, as this is set during the protagonist's incarceration explained in Skate 2. Because the Nintendo DS and Wii lack the dual analog joysticks that were used for control in the original game, the controls for Skate It were redesigned to take advantage of each platform's respective control methods. For example, the Wii version utilizes the motion sensing of the Wii Remote to control the player's skateboard, with gestures used to perform tricks, while the Nintendo DS version features stylus and touchscreen control. The Wii version also features support for the Wii Balance Board. The Wii version uses a modified version of the original's game engine, supports 480p and widescreen display options, and contains the instant Replay feature from the original game. The Wii version also offers a deep and unique career mode that allows the player to earn sponsors, unlock gear, and travel to places such as London, Barcelona, Paris, Shanghai, San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro, a first for the series. In addition, a number of offline and online multiplayer modes are available.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 19, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "EA Montreal", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_It", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18276-skate-it\n"}
