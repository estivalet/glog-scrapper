{"altername_name": ["London Taxi Rushour"], "name": "London Taxi: Rush Hour", "overview": "The player needs to choose a cab and driver then pick up hitchhikers and drive them to their destinations while speeding through traffic, going on sidewalks, and driving onto ramps through mid-air. It has been classified as a clone of the classic game franchise Crazy Taxi. Also because this game has no traffic lights, stop signs, or even law enforcers, the cab drivers get to ignore the speed limit and ram and/or evade other vehicles on the road just like in Crazy Taxi.[1]", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 12, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Data Design Interactive", "publishers": "Popcorn Arcade", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Taxi:_Rush_Hour", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8KKVetDtWY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8696-london-taxi-rush-hour\n"}
