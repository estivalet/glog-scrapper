{"altername_name": ["ObsCure II", "ObsCure 2"], "name": "ObsCure: The Aftermath", "overview": "It has been two years since the incident at Leafmore High you witnessed in ObsCure and the survivors of the nightmare moved on to a university of Fallcreek. When they killed Herbert Friedman, the conductor of the biological experiment with the black flowers, they assumed everything was okay, of course it was not. The seeds of the flower had already spread around and it grew and blossomed without much notice. When it was discovered, that the flowers contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams, it became the new hit drug on the campus. Now the seeds begin to germinate and the bad trip turns into a horrible nightmare. The only ones that really know what is going on are the ones that are experiencing it for the second time and hide terrible secrets inside themselves... Most of the time you take control over two of the six available characters. Each one has a speciality that comes in handy in order to open blocked doors or reaching new heights. Kenny for example has more muscles than brain and is therefore able to move around crates. Mei is instead a hacker and knows how to hack access panels. You can switch between both characters at any time and if you need another character in a given situation, you can go back to a gathering point and change your team.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Hydravision Entertainment", "publishers": "Ignition Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscure_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GrbmRUX8pU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8731-obscure-the-aftermath\n"}
