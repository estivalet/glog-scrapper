{"altername_name": [], "name": "EA Sports Active: NFL Training Camp", "overview": "In NFL Training Camp, players perform various drills that are commonly performed in the NFL Scouting Combine, such as the 40-yard dash. At the end of every drill, a graph appears to inform the player of how many calories he/she has burned throughout the course of the drill, as well as the median of the player's heart rate. Players are rewarded with points and achievements for their performance. In the game, the player can participate in the NFL Combine 60-Day Challenge, which lets players work for four days per week for 60 days in the drills performed in the Combine. Points and achievements that are earned by the player can be compared to other people who have played on the console, as well as people on the player's friend list. The game also has set up public groups for players to join, and players can contribute their stats to their team.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 16, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Canada", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports_Active_NFL_Training_Camp", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103932-ea-sports-active-nfl-training-camp\n"}
