{"altername_name": [], "name": "SD Gundam Gashapon Wars", "overview": "SD Gundam Gashapon Wars (SD\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0 \u30ac\u30b7\u30e3\u30dd\u30f3\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba) is a simulation game where you can organize your original units with your favorite mobile suits and share points on the map in the form of a camp. The recorded modes include a one-player mode with a variety of ways to play, a \"survival mode\" where all participants are enemies, a \"100 question battle\" that clears the mission, and an action RPG-like \u201cdangerous dungeons\u201d mode. In addition, it has a mode that allows up to 4 players to play. Over 40 types of fields are recorded as battle stages. Each time you turn on the power, a new main map appears at random, so you can enjoy the game with a fresh feeling every time. More than 150 types of large and small types of MS appear. Some MSs can be deformed or fly. You can also collect them, and you can enjoy the MSs you get at the gallery. The battle starts when MSs collide. In the battle scene, elements of the action game are also included. In addition to the strategy-oriented fighting method that advantageously develops the battle station based on the number and compatibility of MSs, the enemy units are operated by themselves by operating a small number of powerful MSs that can be annihilated.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 24, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco Bandai Games", "publishers": "Namco Bandai Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140876-sd-gundam-gashapon-wars\n"}
