{"altername_name": ["Art Style Series: DIALHEX"], "name": "Art Style: ROTOHEX", "overview": "Rotate and group colored triangles to create matching hexagons, but don\u2019t let the playing field become full! Use colored triangle panels to create a vibrant mosaic of stained glass in Art Style: ROTOHEX. As triangles fall from the top of the screen, rotate them to group six panels of the same color and create a matching hexagon (HEX). Once the HEX has been formed, it will disappear, allowing the existing panels to shift and more to fill the playing field. Two different styles of intuitive controls and the clear-cut goal allow you to focus solely on the game play\u2014which is vital, as the playing field will be full of panels before you know it. With multiple modes available (unlock more as you progress farther in SOLO mode), special item panels at your disposal, and the ability to play cooperatively or competitively with a friend, there will always be another HEX to create!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 27, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Skip Ltd.", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotohex", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71779-art-style-rotohex\n"}
