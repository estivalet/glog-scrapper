While the last game emphasized relaxation, this one is designed with more adventure in mind. Divers might find themselves escaping from or calming down attacking sharks, exploring shipwrecks or finding treasure. Endless Ocean: Blue World also has more creatures and improved graphics designed to fully immerse players in an ocean environment that they can freely explore at their own pace.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 22, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Arika", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_Ocean_2:_Adventures_of_the_Deep", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-GVXtSPNVA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12605-endless-ocean-blue-world\n"}
