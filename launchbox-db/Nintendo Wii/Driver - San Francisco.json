{"altername_name": [], "name": "Driver: San Francisco", "overview": "The Wii version of the game does not include the \"Shift\" mechanic but allows players to use guns while driving. The SMG, the pistol, the shotgun, the assault rifle and the RPG are all the weapons available in the game. All weapons can be upgraded in the following categories: clip size, reload speed, and damage. There is a maximum of four levels for each upgrade. Upgrade points can be earned by doing various tricks and earning awards around the city. A new feature for the Wii is the localized multi-player, where a second player may take control of the gun or, if they desire, can connect a DS, DSi or 3DS system through download play. The DS device can be used to make roadblocks, look for police and buy player 1 some more time through playing various mini games. There is also a four player split-screen multiplayer. The split screen mode includes four game variants. The variants are Capture the flag, in which the players must grab a flag and drive it to a specific location, Pass the Bomb, in which players must pass a bomb from car to car before a timer counts down, ending the game, Gold Rush, in which the players must grab a bag of money and hold on to it for points, and elimination, in which players must race each other. There is also a cops and robbers split screen mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "September 6, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Ubisoft Porto Alegre", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver:_San_Francisco#Nintendo_Wii", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7621-driver-san-francisco\n"}
