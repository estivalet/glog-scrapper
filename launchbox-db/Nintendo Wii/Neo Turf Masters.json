{"altername_name": [], "name": "Neo Turf Masters", "overview": "Neo Turf Masters is a golf game that offers play in three different countries. You can play in the US, Germany, and Japan. There are 18 holes per course, just like in real life, which totals to 54 holes. The game features a two-player versus mode and three single player modes. You can choose from one of six different characters, who each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Like many other golf games, you use an accurate click type of play, where you click in an overhead map where you want to hit the ball, then adjust hook, slice, and power. In Versus mode, you can earn \"super-clubs\" that can only be used once. These can also be traded between friends. The ACA NeoGeo series release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One contain both the US and Japanese game versions, as well as Hi Score and Caravan modes which can all be launched from the main menu", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "August 18, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nazca", "publishers": "D4 Enterprise", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/IG8yOOPvzpY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161100-neo-turf-masters\n"}
