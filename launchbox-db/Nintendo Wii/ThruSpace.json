{"altername_name": ["ThruSpace: High Velocity 3D Puzzle", "Surinuke Anatousu"], "name": "ThruSpace", "overview": "ThruSpace is a unique 3D puzzle game that will put your spatial awareness and reaction times to the ultimate test. Steer a Keydron, a simple geometric shape, at high speed through gaps in a series of walls, rotating it to the correct angle to fit through: the more walls you pass through the more you score, plus, you can pick up crystals to boost your points. Once you've mastered the basics, learn how to do tricks and combos. Some gaps are bigger than the Keydron, but you can fill the entire space with the Keydron's shadow before passing through it, upping your score even further. There are three modes to enjoy - Normal, Endless and Trick Challenge - and you can save three of your best runs as replays to watch again in Keydron Memories mode. Plus, upload your scores to the online leaderboard and see how you stack up with players from across the world!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 18, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Keys Factory", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThruSpace", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81885-thruspace\n"}
