From the original Game Boy classic Kirby's Dream Land to New Challenge Stages based on 2011's Kirby's Return to Dream Land, players can follow the evolution of Kirby's remarkable abilities - and his pesky enemies - through six complete games and then some. The collection also includes a music CD*, an interactive timeline and a special anniversary book, giving both new and experienced players a way to fully immerse themselves in the one-of-a-kind fun of Kirby.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "July 19, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby's_Dream_Collection", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JMzZnWE28w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14138-kirbys-dream-collection-special-edition\n"}
