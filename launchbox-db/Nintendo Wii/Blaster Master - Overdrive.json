{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blaster Master: Overdrive", "overview": "BLASTER MASTER OVERDRIVE is an action-shooter charging players with saving the world from virus-infected mutants. BLASTER MASTER OVERDRIVE is an action-adventure game that takes place on an Earth infected by an aggressive, polymorphic virus. Poor, defenseless animals worldwide infected by the virus have been turned into flesh-eating, hemoglobin-swilling terrors. Fortunately, the world has Alex. And, even more coincidentally, he happens to be one of the world\u2019s foremost biologists - specializing in viral mutation profiles and genetic manipulation. Every studious biologist facing imminent global annihilation needs a sweet ride, and Alex is no exception. He has S.O.P.H.I.A., a shape-shifting, gas-guzzling, projectile-spewing paean to destruction on four wheels. Things look grim, but with Alex and S.O.P.H.I.A. on the case, the world just may have a chance this time.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 8, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Gaijinworks", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_Master:_Overdrive", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34257-blaster-master-overdrive\n"}
