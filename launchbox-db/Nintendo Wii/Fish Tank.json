FishTank is a combination of a very popular Match 3 genre with a puzzle video gamestyle. It is an arcade-style matching game but instead of matching gems or blocks you collect shoals of colored fish. In order to do that, you need to build up a combination of four or more identical fish and press a corresponding button to remove them from the net. The gameplay goes horizontally \u2013 not vertically as you might be used to. Looking for more?
