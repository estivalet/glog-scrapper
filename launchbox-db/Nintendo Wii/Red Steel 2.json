{"altername_name": [], "name": "Red Steel 2", "overview": "In Red Steel 2 Wild West gunplay and Samurai skill with the blade collide head on. Set in a desert-bound, high-tech metropolis a swordsman with no name is nearly all that is left of the once powerful Kusagari-clan. A clan known as \"the Jackals\", lead by one known as \"Payne\", are responsible and now it is the Swordsman's duty and you're to avenge the fallen Kusagari. Red Steel 2 is a single player first-person shooter developed exclusively for Wii and designed to utilize the Wii Remote's optional MotionPlus technology. Players will pick up the Wii Remote and swing it freely as the sword on-screen follows their precise movement - and even measures the strength of their swing. With this added ability of the Wii MotionPlus to sense the strength of a swing, you will literally be able to make an impact on your adversaries through power and precision and even engage multiple pistol-packing enemies at once, deflecting bullets with precise sword strokes. Along with less stylish actions, players rack up points through executing combos, finishing moves and other actions as members of the rival Jackal clan are eliminated. Additional abilities and weapons are earned or are available for purchase as victories pile up.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 23, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Ubisoft Paris", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Steel_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9AfdFLMJ_g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/800-red-steel-2\n"}
