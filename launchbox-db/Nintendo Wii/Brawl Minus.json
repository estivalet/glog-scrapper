{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brawl Minus", "overview": "Brawl- (also known as Brawl Minus or B-) is a mod of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Brawl- was initially created as a parody of the then-popular Brawl+, which was designed to be balanced through reasonable tweaks to characters; in addition to its name being a pun on the mod, Brawl-'s goal instead was to give all characters incredible buffs until they all became equally overpowered, and thus, balanced. Brawl- notably eclipsed the popularity of Brawl+ after its release, and it was even featured at some tournaments as a side event, such as at Apex 2010. Its popularity has since been overtaken by Project M, but Brawl- still maintains a devoted cult following, and development of the mod has continued into the present day, making it one of the oldest mods for Brawl that remains in active development; version 4.0BC notably features Pichu, Mewtwo, Roy, and Waluigi as additions to the character roster.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/0gxSk_7Ohx8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90124-brawl-minus\n"}
