Brennpunkt City"], "name": "Emergency Mayhem", "overview": "Emergency Mayhem puts the player at the helm of the three emergency services in a frantic race against time to hold together Crisis City, a mad metropolis falling apart at the seams. Combining chaotic driving sequences with arcade mini-games, you'll be in stitches controlling the frenzied police, fire service or paramedics as they dash around the city from one emergency situation to the next. With over 30 missions, it's a non-stop time crisis where you'll be rescuing people from burning buildings, defusing bombs and more.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "April 15, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "IR Gurus Interactive Ltd.", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Mayhem", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNGU7ysb4Zc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31237-emergency-mayhem\n"}
