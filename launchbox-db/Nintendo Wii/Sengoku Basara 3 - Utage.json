Sengoku BASARA 3 Utage was meant to be a more light-hearted and fun game than its predecessor, hence the title \"Utage\", which means party. While it keeps the same background and general information about the time period as in Sengoku BASARA 3, some of the eight new stories only marginally reference the plot that was introduced in the previous game. Sengoku BASARA 3 save data can be synced with Sengoku BASARA 3 Utage. If they are unlocked, alternate costumes and personal items will be brought over. Synching save data with certain achievements will give the player extra gold.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 10, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15985-sengoku-basara-3-utage\n"}
