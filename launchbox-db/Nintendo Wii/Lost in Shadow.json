No one knows who built this or why it was built. One thing is certain, the Tower both sheds a large shadow and at the same time is filled with moving shadows. There is a shadow of a boy that climbs this tower. He runs through the shadow of the Tower, solves mysteries and puzzles along the way, and fights off enemies that try to impede his progress. The boy is not affected by gravity but his movement is restricted within the thin boarder between light and shadow. The boy is not alone in his endeavors as a creature of light joins him on his quest. A winged sylph known as a \u201cSpangle\u201d supports him in his journey. Lost In Shadow mixes unique platform elements and levels of puzzling, to challenge the player. The combination of light and shadow creates a unique blend of game styles, with the shadow boy altering shapes of surrounding objects\u2019 shadows, creating walkways to previously inaccessible areas, and adventuring into a world never before seen on Wii.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "January 4, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Shadow", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxhjogVYPM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14354-lost-in-shadow\n"}
