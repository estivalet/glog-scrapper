{"altername_name": ["Wall-E: Der Letzte r\u00e4umt die Erde auf", "Disney-Pixar WALL-E"], "name": "WALL-E", "overview": "Wall-E is based off of the 2008 Disney/Pixar movie of the same name. The cutscenes closely follow the movie, with added scenes and dialogue added to give more to the game. The gameplay is a basic platformer with a bit of strategy involved, using Wall-E to navigate areas and pick things up to use, players must also figure out ways to reach more out of the reach areas due to Wall-E's limited jump capacity. There are also racing stages designed for the robot, EVE, where the player flies through constricted areas, avoiding fall obstacles.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 24, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Heavy Iron Studios", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7440-wall-e\n"}
