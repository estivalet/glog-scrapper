{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wild West Guns", "overview": "Draw your revolver to see if you're the fastest gun in the West! Adjust your speed and accuracy as targets or enemies appear in front of you. Point and shoot to earn more points. You can aim at anything, so be sure to explore the environment for elements that will earn you more shooting points. Identify your enemies among the characters you encounter, but do not shoot at innocent citizens! Take part in an Old West-style train attack or challenge your skills in a variety of increasingly difficult challenges in other beautiful, classic, and lively Western environments. As you progress through challenges, you'll earn medals and rewards, making for nonstop and addictive action. Play in a two-player multiplayer mode where you and your partner can combine points, or play against each other to find out who's the fastest gun in the West.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "August 4, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Gameloft", "publishers": "Gameloft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_West_Guns", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73552-wild-west-guns\n"}
