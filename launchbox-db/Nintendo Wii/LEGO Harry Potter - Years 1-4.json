Casting spells is an integral part of the gameplay, with a wide range of spells available for unlocking as the player progresses. As there are many spells available in the game, the player can use the spell wheel to select the spell. Potion-making is another integral feature; potions can help the player complete levels or, if created incorrectly, have adverse side effects such as turning the player into a frog.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 10, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Traveller's Tales (UK)", "publishers": "Warner Bros.
