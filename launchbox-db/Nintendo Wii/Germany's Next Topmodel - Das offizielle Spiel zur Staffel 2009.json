Here the player has to choose between three sentences, two mean and a nice one. Of course just the nice one improves the stat. The styling is divided into clothes, make up and hairstyle.

These are mini games where the player needs to emulate movements with his input device.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Coreplay", "publishers": "SevenOne Intermedia", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159660-germanys-next-topmodel-das-offizielle-spiel-zur-staffel-2009\n"}
