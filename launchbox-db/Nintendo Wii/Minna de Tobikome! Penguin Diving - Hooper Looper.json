Become that penguin, let's enjoy the thrill full of high diving! During falling, score goes through a ring that appears one after another. The score changes according to the type of ring and the speed of the moment he crawled through. Let's go through the ring quickly and aim for a high score. Easy operation. Tilt the Wii remote control left and right to move the penguin left and right. For young children and those who do not normally play games, you can play with ease. By using the acceleration function of the 2 button of the Wii remote control and the 1-button deceleration function, even higher scores can be aimed. There are 7 types of stages, including icebergs and caves. Obstacles such as snowy mountains and fighting when you hit, and the Ojama character will make the game excitement. In battle mode, you can play up to 4 people at the same time with your family and friends (you need a number of Wii remote control). Easy rule of \"win the most if you get through the ring\". Let's pass through the ring all the while paying attention to the interference of other players. The scores of each stage in single-person mode correspond to Wi-Fi ranking, and you can compete with players nationwide.
