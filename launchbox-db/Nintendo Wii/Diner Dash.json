{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diner Dash", "overview": "Diner Dash, the number one PC Action Puzzle game has landed onto WiiWare! Guide Flo, an office-worker turned restaurateur, as she builds up her empire over four unique diners! Go online to face players in head to head matches! If you feel up to the challenge, join up with a friend or another player online for a Team Dash game where your team will take on six other players to see whose diner is the best in town! Players take direct control of Flo as she runs around to seat patrons, take orders, deliver food, take payment and bus tables as efficiently as possible within the time limit allowed. Players fond of the traditional control schemes may also use a point-and-click style with hotkeys to aid Flo in her quest for customer satisfaction, which is reflected in a heart meter that empties as customers lose patience. If the meter empties completely, then the customer will leave the restaurant.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 16, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner_Dash", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72047-diner-dash\n"}
