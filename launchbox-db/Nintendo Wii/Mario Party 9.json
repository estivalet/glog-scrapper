{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario Party 9", "overview": "A new form of gameplay is introduced in this game: players will move all at once through the board in a vehicle. Instead of trying to collect coins to buy stars, players receive Mini Stars (bananas in DK's Jungle Ruins) if they pass by them. Players must try to avoid Mini Ztars, which deduct their current amount of Mini Stars. In this game, the minigames don't appear after everyone moves, but only when a player ends up on any of the spaces that triggers a minigame.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 2, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nd Cube", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Party_9", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN7E4wDdO7c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8969-mario-party-9\n"}
