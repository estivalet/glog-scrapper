The player has no weapons against the ghosts, and instead must run away to avoid being touched and killed. The game uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as well as the Wii Balance Board for different elements in the game. Ikenie no Yoru was released in March 2011, and was not released outside Japan. However, an unofficial English patch was released on 03.31.2020 by Brand Newman. A group of college students have decided to take a trip to a place called the Tsukuyomi Ravine, where people used to sacrifice to the gods. There are five main characters in this game, which the game encourages the player to rename with the names of their friends: Black, Blue, Yellow, Pink and Red. Black invites the group to the ravine, and his father owns the mansion in which they're staying at. Red is the hot-tempered leader of the group. He starts the whole mess with the statement \"Let's test our courage\". Blue is kind and has a strong sense of justice. Yellow has a pure heart - she is kind, well raised and nice to people. Pink states her opinions clearly and makes sure everyone hears them. Also, a mysterious young girl comes along the game and she seems to get along with Yellow. An extra character, \"You\", is playable in the epilogue of the story. The player controls each of the characters in turn as they explore the mansion.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 24, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "publishers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikenie_no_Yoru", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJDaz0ggwX4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134167-ikenie-no-yoru\n"}
