First of all, try interacting with him by moving the Wii Remote or pressing the buttons and seeing how much he loves it! Once you've gotten to know the crazy guy, it's time to change his appearance in the Lab! Mess with his head and place seasonal accessories on him to act as a hat, or change his look entirely with the painting module! When you've made your raving Rabbid completely unique, you can take a photo and send it in a Wii message to show your friends!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 28, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Ubisoft Entertainment", "publishers": "Ubisoft Entertainment", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23786-rabbids-lab\n"}
