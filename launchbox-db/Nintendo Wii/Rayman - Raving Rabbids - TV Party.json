{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rayman: Raving Rabbids: TV Party", "overview": "Very much in the same vein as the previous two Rabbids games, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party is a collection of party minigames, distinguished by its television theme, 2D artwork, and its compatability with Wii Balance Boards for certain minigames. Multiplayer gameplay consists of a series of randomly selected minigames resembling television shows or movies, each of which can be optionally interrupted by a WarioWare-style advertisement microgame. Single player gameplay has the player unlock new minigames by winning at the available ones. Minigames in TV Party include the \"Monster Tractors\" racing game; several lightgun shoot-'em-ups like \"Night of the Zombids\", \"Star Worse\", and \"Rabzilla\"; the burger-cooking- and walrus-feeding-sim \"Flippin' Burgers\"; the coin-collecting platformer \"Mega Balls\"; and a few Guitar Hero-like rhythm games, among others.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 18, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Ubisoft", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayman_Raving_Rabbids:_TV_Party", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsmz78ratbY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/866-rayman-raving-rabbids-tv-party\n"}
