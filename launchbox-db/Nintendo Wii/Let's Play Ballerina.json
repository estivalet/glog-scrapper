{"altername_name": ["Paris Ballerina", "Spielen wir Ballerina", "Repetto Paris: Let's Play Ballerina"], "name": "Let's Play Ballerina", "overview": "Classical dance is one of the most popular hobbies among girls. Ballet tells a story, expressed through music and dance instead of words. In Let's Play Ballerina, players take on the role of a 12-year-old girl, who has just been admitted to a very prestigious dancing academy. During her period of training, the heroine commits herself solely to dancing. Her dream is to become a great prima ballerina. But the path to success is full of challenges. Also, she should never underestimate her fellow students, because some of them would do anything to outdo their competition. But only the best will get a chance to shine, and therefore players will have to keep proving and improving their skills. Luckily, they are getting support from Nathan, a young, very talented dancer, the heartthrob of every girl in the academy. Together, they train between lessons, so that the heroine can make her dream come true and become a famous prima ballerina. \"Repetto Presents Ballerina\" is set in the academy, as well as an opera house. The single player title offers awesome dance animations, gorgeous 2D and 3D graphics, and a gripping story filled with passion and adventure. Just as in real life, hard training is a main factor. At the same time, the game tries to convey values such as friendship, loyalty, and helpfulness.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 8, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ZigZag Island", "publishers": "Deep Silver", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79659-lets-play-ballerina\n"}
