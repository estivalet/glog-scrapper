{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tales of Graces", "overview": "Tales of Graces is the twelfth game in the Tales series, following a format similar to its predecessors. Exploration takes place on a field where items can be collected or side-quests can be initiated; coming into contact with an enemy begins a battle. Battles follow the Style Shift Linear Motion Battle System, in which simple attacks and special skills are executed in real-time. Skills are performed through button combinations which may be mapped in menus beforehand, and are split into two categories: Assault Artes are special attacks done on the spot while Burst Artes are actions which must be charged, such as healing spells. The amount of attacks that can be performed in one combo is regulated by Chain Capacity, more frequently referred to in-game as CC. When CC is used up, it can be replenished by blocking, walking, or simply waiting. The number of CC available for each combo increases as characters level up, allowing for more powerful and intricate combos as more attacks are learned.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 10, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco Tales Studio", "publishers": "Namco Bandai Games", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Graces", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZpZiomZ3f8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77335-tales-of-graces\n"}
