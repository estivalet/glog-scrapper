{"altername_name": ["Penguin Seikatsu"], "name": "Snowpack Park", "overview": "Bring penguins back to the safety of Snowpack Park. Play games with them, pet them, and feed them so they stay happy! Welcome to Snowpack Park! You\u2019ve arrived hoping to hang out with some of the local penguins and learn how to take care of them. However, a recent storm has just sent the residents of the park fleeing to various islands throughout the area, and there are only a few penguins to be found. Take control of either a Mii character or one of the characters already prepared for the game and brave various terrain and unexpected obstacles as you travel from island to island, finding penguins and bringing them back safely to the park. But getting them back is just the beginning. The penguins have different moods, which will go up and down depending on how much interaction they have with you, and if a penguin's mood gets too bad, it will leave the park. To prevent that from happening, you must learn how to feed, pet, and play games with the penguins in order to keep them happy. Throughout the park, you\u2019ll also find fun minigames to play with the penguins, headwear pieces for the penguins to wear, fish for them to eat, blowfish to roll up into snowballs, and a variety of other useful things. You can even collect photos of yourself and the penguins by visiting one of the park's photo-taking locations. Prepare yourself for a heartwarming Antarctic adventure!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 22, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Skip", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpack_Park", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73519-snowpack-park\n"}
