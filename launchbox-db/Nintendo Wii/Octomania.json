{"altername_name": [], "name": "Octomania", "overview": "The player uses the Wii Remote to control a 2x2 cursor over a field of colored octopuses. Pressing the A button causes the octopuses under the cursor to rotate counter-clockwise. Numbered nets are scattered around the playing field. If the player arranges a number of same-colored octopuses under the net, the octopuses under the net, as well as any other octopuses of the same color which are connected orthogonally, are removed. By removing octopuses in this way, the player can send sea urchins to their opponents playing field. Sea urchins can not be removed using nets, but are removed if they are orthogonal to other octopuses being removed, similar to ojama puyos in Puyo Puyo. If the player's field fills up for 3 seconds, they lose. The game features both a single player story mode, and a multiplayer mode for up to four players. Online play is also included using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.[4]", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hyper-Devbox", "publishers": "Conspiracy Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttoh0sToZ5g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17553-octomania\n"}
