{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bonsai Barber", "overview": "A tasty nibble of a game, it is bite-sized barbering at its finest, in only minutes a day. The village residents are hungry for the latest in foliage fashion, and it\u2019s up to you\u2014the new barber\u2014to fix them up. Use the tools of your trade: scissors, clippers, spray can, and more, in this humorous, first-of-its-kind \u201cfirst-person-groomer\u201d game. Bonsai Barber features a colourful cast of twelve intriguing customers, including a temperamental shallot starlet (don't call her an onion!), an oddball strawberry boffin, a cactus cowboy, a daredevil carrot, and a suave banana with top-secret clearance. Each day, five customers arrive to test your stylistic skill. If the customer requests a specific style, you'll plow that furrow, or you can rely on your expertise to pick from over thirty popular fashions... Or why not turn over a new leaf; be creative and see how they react! They\u2019re a demanding bunch, so if you miss an appointment, you\u2019ll hear about it\u2014on your Wii Message Board. But, if you do a good job, you may receive a gift or even a postcard from an exotic destination, as your happy customers travel to distant lands and show off their exquisite coifs.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 30, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Zoonami", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai_Barber", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29926-bonsai-barber\n"}
