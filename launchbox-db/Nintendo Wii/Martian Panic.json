{"altername_name": [], "name": "Martian Panic", "overview": "Martian Panic takes the Wii shooting genre out of this world, with new levels of strategy and experimental weaponry. If one gun at a time isn't enough, players can grab a second Wii Remote and blast away in the game's dual-wielding mode. Up to four players can battle simultaneously against the Martian onslaught and the advanced camera system ensures that the gamer's vantage is always right. The rules are simple but the action is intense, so hold onto your helmet as the challenges escalate.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "August 26, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "nFusion Interactive", "publishers": "Zoo Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75797-martian-panic\n"}
