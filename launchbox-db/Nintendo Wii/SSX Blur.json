{"altername_name": [], "name": "SSX Blur", "overview": "SSX Blur brings back the soul of SSX - remixed, re-energized, and fully realized. Revolutionary controls take full advantage of the Nintendo Wii's potential by putting you in total command of your skier or rider. The new On-the-Ground and In-the-Air controls will translate every motion you make into moves that create mountain legends. One hand controls you as you tear down the mountain; the other unleashes your array of aerial maneuvers. The mountain is your playground with SSX Blur. Familiar SSX faces return including Mac, Kaori, Psymon, and Allegra -- plus two all-new hot shot riders", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 27, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSX_Blur", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4171-ssx-blur\n"}
