Well then, gear up to put your racing skills to the test in a frantic trip across the United States, following a route that you won\u2019t find on any map! Whether it\u2019s the rolling hills of Appalachia, the flowing corn fields of Iowa, or the crowded tunnels below Chicago, you\u2019ll find yourself too focused on the intense racing action to worry about the scenery. Get started by picking from a garage full of cars to find the one that best suits your style\u2014if you\u2019re good enough, you\u2019ll even find a few hidden ones to round out your selection. Then choose one of three different playing perspectives and get ready to hang on tight! With five difficulty levels, the ability to remove traffic or other racers, and two- player simultaneous racing, it\u2019s enough to make you forget all about finding that next rest stop.
