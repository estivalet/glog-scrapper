{"altername_name": ["Farm Story: Exciting Animal March", "Harvest Moon: Deine Tierparade"], "name": "Harvest Moon: Animal Parade", "overview": "A divine tree which once stood in the middle of the Harvest Goddess' pond has begun to weaken, the creatures are beginning to leave the land, and the five bells have lost their power. Only the strength of the Harvest King can revive the earth and bring the tree back to life, but he is nowhere to be found. You must ring the five bells, bring the Harvest King back to the island, and help revive the Goddess' Tree, while at the same time running a large farm plantation. The release of this game for Wii allows the player to use the Wii Remote as an axe, shovel, watering can, fishing pole, milking the animals, and has many other uses. The player must grow and sell their crops to make money to buy things and furnish your ranch house. There are lots of crops to grow, including beans, tomatoes, potatoes, and many more.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 10, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon:_Animal_Parade", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxRPyg6c6JE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1512-harvest-moon-animal-parade\n"}
