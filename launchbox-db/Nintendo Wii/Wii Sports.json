{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wii Sports", "overview": "This is what video games should be: fun for everyone. Wii Sports offers five distinct sports experiences, each using the Wii Remote controller to provide a natural, intuitive and realistic feel. To play a Wii Sports game, all you need to do is pick up a controller and get ready for the pitch, serve or that right hook. If you've played any of these sports before, you're ready for fun! Play Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling and Boxing in the comfort of one's living room. No ball boys scurrying about, no oil from the alleys to get players dirty and no rain to keep anyone from a day at the court, park or course. Use the Wii Remote controller to mimic the actions of swinging a racket, bat or club, roll a ball down an alley or bring the left jab. Players can use their own Mii caricatures in the game and play them against their friends' Miis for a more personalized experience. As players improve, their Miis' skill levels will increase, so that they can see exactly how much better they've become. People of all skill levels can pick up and play any of the games in the unprecedented Wii Sports package, making this truly a title for everyone!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 19, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.29", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mnuKggIjo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3126-wii-sports\n"}
