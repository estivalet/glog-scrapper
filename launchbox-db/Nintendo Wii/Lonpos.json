{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lonpos", "overview": "LONPOS is a simple yet challenging puzzle game that tests your logic and concentration, either by yourself or working with - or against - other players. The aim is to arrange differently-shaped pieces to fit inside a box by moving and rotating them with the Wii Remote so that all pieces are used. In Normal Mode you battle the clock, solving puzzles as fast as you can to win points. Or take on Continuous Mode, where one false move means failure. In Cooperative Mode, take turns with a friend to complete puzzles, or try Versus Mode to battle with up to three opponents, either on the same Wii console or worldwide via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. LONPOS comes with lots of puzzles to tax your grey matter - but if you hunger for more of a challenge, you can obtain even more puzzles, and also new backgrounds and visuals, via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Pay & Play!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 2, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Genki", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonpos", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77591-lonpos\n"}
