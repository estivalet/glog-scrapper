It follows The Chipmunks as they play their way from small venues (such as a high school prom or a civic center) to massive crowds at Burning Munk and ultimately Rockathonapalooza. The soundtrack features 40 popular songs, including \"All the Small Things\" by Blink-182, \"It's Tricky\" by Run-D.M.C., and \"Heartbreak Hotel\" by Elvis Presley. The gameplay itself is similar to other rhythm games such as Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
