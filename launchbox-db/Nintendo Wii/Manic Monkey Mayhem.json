{"altername_name": [], "name": "Manic Monkey Mayhem", "overview": "As with most fights, nobody really knows where, how or when this rivalry started, but this group of monkeys have not stopped battling for as long as they can remember. Their chosen fighting style is the ancient art of Banana Flinging and, now sworn enemies, this band of angry apes is each determined to outlast the other in a furious contest of fruity war. Controlling one of eight monkeys you will do battle with the up to seven others across eight different themed landscapes. In single player, battle through three increasingly difficult campaigns of missions ranging from survival to coconut fights or have a one off battle against the clock, as a team or a standard deathmatch. Connect additional Wii Remotes to battle against up to three additional players or compete against strangers or your friends over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. May the best monkey win.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "May 24, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "The Code Monkeys", "publishers": "The Code Monkeys", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73383-manic-monkey-mayhem\n"}
