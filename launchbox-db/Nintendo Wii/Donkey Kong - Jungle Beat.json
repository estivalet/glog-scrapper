{"altername_name": ["New Play Control! Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat"], "name": "Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat", "overview": "Gameplay involves combat, jumping, and counterattacking. While the traditional GameCube controllers are compatible, Jungle Beat uses a pair of bongo drums to control Donkey Kong's (DK) actions. Hitting the left drum causes DK to move left, while hitting the right drum causes him to move right. Hitting both drums at the same time causes DK to jump. Clapping one's hands or hitting the sides of the drums also causes DK to clap, which has various consequences depending on the situation.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "May 4, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Nintendo EAD Tokyo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Jungle_Beat", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYhf70z4S58", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4781-donkey-kong-jungle-beat\n"}
