{"altername_name": ["El Oso Yogi: El Videojuego", "Yogi B\u00e4r: Das Videospiel"], "name": "Yogi Bear: The Video Game", "overview": "Yogi Bear: The Video Game is a platform game based on the movie that combines actors playing the humans along with CGI characters of Yogi Bear, his friend Boo Boo and other animals. Land developers want to shut down Jellystone Park as it nears its 100th anniversary. Yogi must make his way through park levels by jumping, crawling, performing belly whomps or slides, sneaking by park visitors, swinging on vines, and even zip-lining. Collect slices of pie and pic-a-nic baskets for points and bonuses. Ranger Smith is on the lookout, so don't disturb animals and visitors in the park. Yogi is helped by his sidekick, Boo Boo, to get through difficult areas. He'll also take photos of endangered animals to help save the park. Dan Aykroyd voices Yogi in the game as well as the movie.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 7, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Monkey Bar Games", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF4L2mKuSCI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33796-yogi-bear-the-video-game\n"}
