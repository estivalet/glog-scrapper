{"altername_name": [], "name": "My Little Baby", "overview": "Have you always dreamed of having a cute little baby to lovingly care for? Well, now is your chance! Suddenly, it has arrived. Your little bundle of joy smiles at you gleefully, and you have to do everything you can to make sure it is provided for, and develops and grows in a healthy manner. Changing, bathing, and feeding are as much a part of your duties as shopping, preparing meals, rocking your baby to sleep, playtime, dressing, and teaching it to crawl and walk. But above all, what your little angel needs is your love and attention. All this, plus an enormous selection of toys, clothes, and other objects will make your little one the happiest baby in the whole wide world!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "April 18, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "dtp young entertainment", "publishers": "dtp young entertainment", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WiiWare_games", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78317-my-little-baby\n"}
