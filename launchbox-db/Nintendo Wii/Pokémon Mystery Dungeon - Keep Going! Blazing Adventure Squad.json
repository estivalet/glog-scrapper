Blazing Adventure Squad) is a Roguelike video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Nintendo for WiiWare as part of the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Adventure Squad! set of games within the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series. The other games within the generation are Pok\u00e9mon Fushigi no Dungeon: Ikuzo! Arashi no B\u014dkendan (Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Let's Go! Stormy Adventure Squad!) and Pok\u00e9mon Fushigi no Dungeon: Mezase! Hikari no B\u014dkendan (Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Go For It! Light Adventure Squad!) Much like standard Pok\u00e9mon releases, all three games share the same engine, artwork, and environments; however each game has entirely unique dungeons built from the shared assets. They were the first Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon titles to be released on a console, and the first to be a Japanese exclusive.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "August 4, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chunsoft", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77070-pokemon-mystery-dungeon-keep-going-blazing-adventure-squad\n"}
