{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dancing Stage: Hottest Party", "overview": "Gameplay is largely unchanged from other Dance Dance Revolution games. However, the game features additional modes taking advantage of the hardware of the Wii. The game allows the integration of the Wii Remote into gameplay, where steps can be replaced by markers requiring a hand motion with the remote. Other step types include steps which must be hit twice. Hottest Party also includes several other modes, including a Free Mode, multi player modes, a battle mode, and Sync mode, where several players play the same chart, and only the lowest step judgment on each arrow will count. Friendship mode is an opposite, where the highest step judgment is counted. Hottest Party also includes Workout Mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 28, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17988-dancing-stage-hottest-party\n"}
