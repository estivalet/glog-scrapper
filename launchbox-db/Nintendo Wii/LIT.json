{"altername_name": ["School of Darkness"], "name": "LIT", "overview": "LIT is a 3D horror action puzzler that follows Jake, a typical, apathetic, slightly emo teenager, who\u2019s trapped in his high school when it\u2019s overrun by dark creatures. Players must guide Jake through 30 classrooms, using the available light sources to create paths to each exit. The goal is to reunite Jake with his girlfriend Rachael, who\u2019s also trapped in the school and calls Jake from time to time on the school\u2019s phone system. Stay in the light and Jake\u2019s safe. Step into the darkness and he\u2019s pulled under. In addition to light puzzling, the game features 5 boss battles against dark faculty members, an unlockable challenge mode, multiple endings, level select mode, and a second playable character. LIT will be released soon, exclusively on Nintendo\u2019s WiiWare platform. Until then, keep your eyes here for the latest details on this game.
