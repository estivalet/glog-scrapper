{"altername_name": ["Blue Oasis: Michinaru Shingai", "Blue Oasis: Michinaru Shinkai"], "name": "My Aquarium 2", "overview": "This time, the theme is the mysterious deep sea. With a single Wii Remote, you can raise fascinating creatures of all shapes and sizes, including deep sea fish and glowing jellyfish! Like the original, you can customise your aquarium, and choose which fish to put in and where to place various decorations. You can also choose from a variety of coloured lights to illuminate your aquarium. In time, your fish might breed to give you a whole new shoal to raise! Create your very own aquarium for endless hours of relaxing fun and entertainment! This sequel features a larger selection of fish and objects than the original! And like before, you can link up to the Forecast Channel to reflect the actual weather. You can send your aquariums to registered friends via WiiConnect24. What's more, Add-On Content will be available for later purchase. Come dive in and see all the wonderful creatures of the deep blue sea!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "September 10, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72733-my-aquarium-2\n"}
