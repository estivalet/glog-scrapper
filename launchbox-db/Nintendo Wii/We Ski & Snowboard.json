{"altername_name": ["Family Ski & Snowboard", "Family Ski: World Ski & Snowboard"], "name": "We Ski & Snowboard", "overview": "We Ski & Snowboard is a wintry thrill ride through many different environments on the awesome Mt. Angrio and cool Jamboree Snow Resort. Players enjoy the classic motion-based controls popularized by We Ski using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers, or by adding the increased realism of the Wii Balance Board for even more ski and snowboard action. Custom characters and player Mii's add even more dimension to snow-capped adventures across even more mountain terrain than ever with vast free-riding areas. Leisurely gondola rides to sloping peaks invite a breathtaking panoramic experience, while heli-drops from extreme dizzying heights offer-up opportunities to shred down vertical cliffs and severe precipices. Players should be sure to watch out for avalanches! Hot Doggers can quench their thirst for excitement with half-pipe courses, and ski technique challenges, while loungers can look forward to other activities including ski school, board school, moguls and slaloms, as well as animal search and rescue. Players can enjoy the sprawling vistas with day, night and dusk skiing, offering countless nuances to an ever-expanding list of experiences. The whole family can still enjoy fast-paced racing action or free-skiing with four-player fun, while single players can enjoy the ride with up to three AI-controlled skiing buddies.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "March 9, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco Bandai Games", "publishers": "Namco Bandai Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Ski_%26_Snowboard", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgDXO9oBHq8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18274-we-ski-snowboard\n"}
