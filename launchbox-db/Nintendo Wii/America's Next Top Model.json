Following the same successful formula as the TV series, one model is dismissed each week following a special challenge; just make sure it's not you! Choose your outfits in a variety of ways to live out the model lifestyle; be it striking a pose for a photographer, keeping your walk timed perfectly on the catwalk, or making sure your make-up is a match for the occasion. Talk to the other models in the apartment and get tips from your coach to help your performance during the week, then test your knowledge of the fashion industry in front of the panel each week to secure your place in the next round.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "June 23, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8791-americas-next-top-model\n"}
