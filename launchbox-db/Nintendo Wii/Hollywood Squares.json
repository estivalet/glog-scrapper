{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hollywood Squares", "overview": "Hollywood Squares is based on the long-running game show and allows two players to play a celebrity and joke-filled version of Tic Tac Toe. Standard stock character models fill out most of the board, while the center square is occupied by one of four celebrities: Brad Garrett, Kathy Griffin, Jeffrey Tambor, or Martin Mull. Choosing one of them during gameplay triggers full motion video of the celebrity answering a question during an actual Hollywood Squares episode. Players can unlock new wardrobe options for their players by winning games and bonus rounds.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "October 3, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Ludia", "publishers": "Encore Software", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113764-hollywood-squares\n"}
