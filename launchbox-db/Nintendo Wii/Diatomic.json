{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diatomic", "overview": "Retro arcade action inside a petri dish! Diatomic is a fast retro arcade action game set inside a set of petri dishes. The safe confines of your petri dish are about to be invaded by nine different diatomic creatures that seek to destroy you. Armed with your shield, tail, strategic intelligence and good reflexes you stand a good chance to defeat the overwhelming odds. You must stay alive during 65 hectic stages, spread over five chapters. The high score list shows what kind of player you are. Playing defensively and gaining an all-out defensive high score is harder to pull off than gaining an all-out offensive high score.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 14, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Grendel Games", "publishers": "Grendel Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72046-diatomic\n"}
