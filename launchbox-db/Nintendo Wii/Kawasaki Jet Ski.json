A stunt mode lets creative players use their Wii Remote to perform numerous airborne tricks, solo gamers can try out Championship Mode and Time Trial, or they can join a friend for multiplayer racing.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "January 22, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Data Design Interactive", "publishers": "Bold Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Jet_Ski", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyethLD1s7U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18578-kawasaki-jet-ski\n"}
