{"altername_name": ["Actionloop Twist", "Minna de Puzzloop"], "name": "Magnetica Twist", "overview": "Twist, aim, and launch marbles to form combos and clear the board before they reach the end! The classic puzzle game Magnetica is now available on WiiWare , putting its own unique \"twist\" on the puzzle-game experience. You're surrounded by marbles, marching slowly but surely down a track. Use a launcher (piloted by a Mii of your choice) to shoot marbles with matching colors and wipe them out before they reach the end of the track. Control couldn't be simpler, as all you need to do is twist the Wii Remote controller to aim and press the A button to shoot. And the game play remains as addictive and deep as you've come to expect in Nintendo's puzzle games, with five varied play modes, advanced mechanics such as the ability to lob marbles, and a never-ending supply of combos. This definitely isn't your typical game of marbles.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "April 22, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Mitchell", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetica#WiiWare_version", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73381-magnetica-twist\n"}
