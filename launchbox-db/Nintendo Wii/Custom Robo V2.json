It is the second title of the Custom Robo series, and the predecessor of Custom Robo for the Nintendo GameCube. The gameplay of Custom Robo V2 is similar to any ordinary RPG: players walk around in an overworld, then engage in battles. However, the game differs from the traditional RPG mold by having a real time battle system. The goal of the game is to win battles to obtain better Robos and parts to improve your combat abilities.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 19, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Noise", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_Robo_V2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162271-custom-robo-v2\n"}
