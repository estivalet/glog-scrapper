{"altername_name": ["Major League Eating"], "name": "Major League Eating: The Game", "overview": "The ultimate chomp-off is about to begin. Grab your Wii Remote controller and dig into 12 different foods as you compete against the greatest major-league eaters in the world. This isn't just a race to stuff your face-you'll need strategy to master a smorgasbord of digestive attacks, defenses and counters. These include the Mega Burp, Gas Attack, Antacid and more. And don't forget to keep an eye on your Barf-O-Meter, because if the food hits the plate twice, you're out. Unlock more than 10 characters in single-player career mode, go gut-to-gut against your friends in versus mode, or compete online using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Online play supports friend codes, random matchmaking and leader boards.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "July 14, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Sensory Sweep Studios", "publishers": "Mastiff", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Eating:_The_Game", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29643-major-league-eating-the-game\n"}
