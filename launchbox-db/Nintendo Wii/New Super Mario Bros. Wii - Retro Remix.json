It will be very similar to its precedessors under many aspects and will have 16-bit graphics, but it will have some new things, too, such as the plot, which will involve Mario, Peach and Bowser being pixelated, and its location which will not be in the Mushroom Kingdom at first, like its prequels, but rather in Enchanted Island. In this game, Mario returns in an all-new 2D adventure that brings back the pixels of its series.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "January 1, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118636-new-super-mario-bros-wii-retro-remix\n"}
