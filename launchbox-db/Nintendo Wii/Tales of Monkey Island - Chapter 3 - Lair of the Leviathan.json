{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tales of Monkey Island: Chapter 3: Lair of the Leviathan", "overview": "In the third Tales of Monkey Island chapter, Guybrush gets in deep (literally!) as his quest for the voodoo exfoliating La Esponja Grande takes a scenic twist -- through the guts of a giant manatee! Trapped in the belly of the beast, our hero encounters a surprising band of castaways, including the long-lost (and obsessive-compulsive) explorer Coronado De Cava. Can the Mighty Pirate win the suspicious De Cava's trust? Will sexy pirate hunter Morgan LeFlay prove to be a ruthless enemy, or an unlikely ally? Will the group find La Esponja Grande in time to save Elaine from the rampant Pox of LeChuck? And will the world be crushed by the gnashing teeth of a certain demonic skull? Tales of Monkey Island's moist and absorbing third episode, Lair of the Leviathan, will answer some of these urgent questions -- and raise still more -- as the five month adventure builds to its epic climax!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "July 29, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Telltale Games", "publishers": "Telltale Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73532-tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-3-lair-of-the-leviathan\n"}
