{"altername_name": [], "name": "Christmas Clix!", "overview": "Christmas doesn't have to be all work for Santa does it? Santa's having some fun and wants you to play along too! While Santa magically stacks the Christmas presents, it's your job to remove the presents and decorate the Christmas tree. Christmas Clix is a casual family friendly game for the Nintendo Wii system. The goal of Christmas Clix is to quickly remove the colored presents and ornaments that Santa stacks by clicking on the same colored presents. As you remove the presents, candy canes and gold coins will fall. Collect enough candy canes and Santa will send you a power-up to help you clear the level. Collect enough gold coins and Santa will send you a toy soldier that unlocks a mini-game. Christmas Clix features 100 levels of fast-paced and progressive Christmas fun with 10 un-lockable mini games.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 30, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "JV Games", "publishers": "JV Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Clix", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72027-christmas-clix\n"}
