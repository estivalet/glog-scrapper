{"altername_name": [], "name": "Defend Your Castle", "overview": "Prepare to Defend your Castle against the relentless army of crayon invaders! Those crafty barbarian hordes have amassed their forces once again to challenge your domain. Will you and your court rise to the challenge, or stand aside as they raze your Castle to the ground? You are the commander of your castle, and it is your duty to pick up the enemy and mercilessly fling them to their demise. Perform this task well, for the invaders you face are numerous and employ many different types of soldiers in their quest for your castle. Attacks come at dawn. The Barbarian invaders arrive in relentless waves until nightfall, when they return to their camp. Luckily the game provides a few tricks up your invisible sleeve including powerful spells, and the capability to convert enemy troops into soldiers to help defend your walls. You can also purchase upgrades and repairs for your castle, which are miraculously administered overnight while the barbarian hordes snore in their camps!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "May 12, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Xgen Studios", "publishers": "Xgen Studios", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defend_Your_Castle", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29642-defend-your-castle\n"}
