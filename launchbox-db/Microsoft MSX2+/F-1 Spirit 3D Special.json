{"altername_name": [], "name": "F-1 Spirit 3D Special", "overview": "The succesor of F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1. Unlike the original, this game uses scaling-based third-person graphics like Pole Position and the like, and focuses specifically on F-1 racing. In addition to the Free Run and Grand Prix modes, there is a two player Battle Mode. The difficulty level can be set, and in Free Run a number of settings (such as the number of laps) is variable. Cars are custom made; the body and color of the car, the engine, the tires, the suspension, the brakes, the gear, and the wings can be all modified.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2+", "release_date": "January 1, 1988", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbrjYm9tDU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33466-f-1-spirit-3d-special\n"}
