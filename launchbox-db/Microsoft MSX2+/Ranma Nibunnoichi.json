{"altername_name": ["Ranma 1/2"], "name": "Ranma Nibunnoichi", "overview": "One of the games based on the manga and anime series Ranma 1/2. The protagonist is a young martial artist who is afflicted with a peculiar curse: touching cold water turns him into a girl. The series features many supportive characters, some of which suffering from a similar predicament (for example, Ranma's father occasionally turns into a panda). This adaptation assumes familiarity with the series and is built like a side-story, focusing on the relationships between the series' characters. The gameplay mostly follows a traditional Japanese adventure format, having no puzzles and mainly requiring the player to visit different locations and deplete all options to advance the story. Actions are represented as icons corresponding to looking, talking, moving, and using an item, including portraits of different characters for multiple conversations. There are also a few turn-based battles adopting a rock-scissors-paper system.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2+", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bothtec", "publishers": "Micro Vision", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPTdL2twd7E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151225-ranma-nibunnoichi\n"}
