{"name": "Faceball", "overview": "Faceball was going to be one of the games to support the unreleased Virtual Boy GameLink cable. Like the Faceball games on other consoles (like Faceball 2000 on Game Boy and SNES), the Virtual Boy version could be described as an ego shooter with smiley balls. The game offers 2 modes of play, \"Normal\", which is the main, 1-player game, and \"Arena\", which most likely is the 2-player mode that uses the link cable. The \"Normal\" mode consists of 4 stages with 14 mazes each, which makes a total number of 56 levels.
