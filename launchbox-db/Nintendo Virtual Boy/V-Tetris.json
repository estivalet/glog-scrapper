{"name": "V-Tetris", "overview": "Tetris has always had depth, but with the Virtual Boy's stereoscopy, you can now see it. At its core, this is just another version of Tetris with its own set of graphics, sounds, and other quirks. Rotate blocks, and when you've formed a complete line they disappear. Mode A is the familiar endless mode of play, where you'll keep going until you've let the pile reach too high. Mode B is another common mode, where there are a set number of lines you must clear before victory is declared. Mode C is the most unique in this game. The game field is twice as wide, but you only use half of it at once; the other half is displayed further away in the background. You can scroll left or right at any time, creating new possibilities for creating lines and strategies.", "platform": "Nintendo Virtual Boy", "release_date": "August 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Locomotive", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Tetris", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18643\n"}
