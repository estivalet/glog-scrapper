{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zipper", "overview": "Zipper is a fixed screen shoot 'em up. It plays similarly to other games of its kind but instead of vicious aliens the enemies here are ordinary objects such as flowers, apples and umbrellas. Each wave have different enemies, and they move back and forth across the screen while firing their projectiles at the player, who controls a spaceship along the bottom of the screen. The ship has a limited amount of gas, but it can be refuelled by shooting gas canisters that at times fall from the sky. Lives are lost when gas runs out, or when hit by either enemy fire or a falling gas canister. The player has five lives when starting out.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mikael Nordstr\u00f6m", "publishers": "ScandSoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scWrlTkXiKU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130589-zipper\n"}
