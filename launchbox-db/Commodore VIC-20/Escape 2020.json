Collect all 44 keys from the rooms of 2020 and find the exit to escape. Your task won't be easy. There are monsters roaming the many rooms and they aren't looking to be your friend. Blast them before you become their dinner. Oh, did I say they have acid for blood? Well of course they do, this is 2020 afterall. Use the joystick to run around and shoot.
