{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cannon Ball", "overview": "Cannon Ball is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The player controls 2 immobile cannons each with 12 shots that fire horizontally from the left. A skull approached from the right, which moves from the top to the bottom of the screen, and then approaches 1 row closer and repeats. The goal is to shoot as many skulls as possible. As skulls approach closer they are worth fewer points. If a skull reaches the cannons it's game over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Decibal Records Inc.", "publishers": "Dynapak Digital Duplication Systems", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167829-cannon-ball\n"}
