{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skramble (Rabbit Software)", "overview": "Skramble is another Scramble clone, this time from Rabbit Software. You fly above a coarse landscape filled with missiles, factories and fuel supplies. Bomb the fuel supplies in order to refill your own fuel, and bomb the rest for points. The missiles are inactive at the beginning, but after a while, they start to launch in order to intercept you. After that, the mountainous landscape turns into a cave, with thin passages that must be navigated while spider-like things fly in your path. You have only one life, after that it is game over for you.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373429-skramble-rabbit-software\n"}
