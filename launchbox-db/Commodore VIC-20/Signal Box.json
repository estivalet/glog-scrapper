{"altername_name": [], "name": "Signal Box", "overview": "Signal Box is a puzzle game for the VIC-20. The goal is to place 10 trains into 10 different sidings by manipulating train switches. Trains start at the central track on the left, and switches are modified by pressing the corresponding number. Every 10 trains safely placed restarts the puzzle with faster moving trains. If two trains end up in the same siding it's game over. The game was developed by Thompson and published in the April, 1985 issue of VICTAPE Computing (a UK based cassette \"e-mag\" for the VIC 20, similar to what Loadstar was for the C64). The game itself was developed in 1984, but not released until 1985.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "April 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thompson", "publishers": "VICTAPE Computing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169245-signal-box\n"}
