{"altername_name": [], "name": "Invaders", "overview": "Invaders is a side view single screen shooter inspired by the arcade game Space Invaders where you control a laser platform at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, blasting aliens in formation above. The aliens move across the screen and when they reach the other side then they move down one place before moving across the screen in the opposite direction. As you blast the aliens, they will drop bombs and these must be avoided, or you lose one of three lives when hit. Between you and the aliens are four shields, but these take damage when hit from you or the aliens and will eventually disappear. Occasionally a Mothership moves across the top of the screen and when destroyed gives you bonus points. Two players can play, and each player takes it in turns when the other player loses a life. You can also select a skill level (1-5) before playing.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LiveWire Software UK", "publishers": "LiveWire Software UK", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLqnhzkrrx0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369089-invaders\n"}
