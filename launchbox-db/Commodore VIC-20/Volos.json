{"altername_name": [], "name": "Volos", "overview": "Originally made for annual comp.sys.sinclair Crap Game Compo, for the ZX Spectrum, the game was later ported to the Commodore VIC-20, the same year, by the same developer. Volos is a small and very basic game (even programmed in BASIC) where you as the ancient Slavonic god of cattle and fertility, Volos (represented by a bull's head) must attract cows into a hole and then land on them. The cow's market (?) value varies constantly, and pressing the attract button at the right moment is vital to quickly increasing your score. Your score is multiplied by your vicinity to the cow, but don't fall into the hole before the cow!", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "July 14, 2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anders Carlsson", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167975-volos\n"}
