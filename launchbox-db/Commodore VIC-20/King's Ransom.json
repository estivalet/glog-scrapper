{"altername_name": ["Kings Ransom"], "name": "King's Ransom", "overview": "King's Ransom (also spelled as Kings Ransom on the title screen) is a 1-player arcade platform game for the VIC-20. Set on a number of moving platforms with holes, the player controls a small character who tries to gather coins that fall from the top of the screen. The player can move and jump laterally, and can also jump a short distance vertically to move to higher platforms. Numerous blue monsters descend from the top of the screen, while red fireballs ascend through spaces from the bottom. The goal is to gather coins before they fall off the screen, while avoiding monsters and not falling into the lava at the bottom. The player starts with 4 lives, and each coin is worth 10 points.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Elder", "publishers": "Nufekop Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fITFf-fzK_g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367998-kings-ransom\n"}
