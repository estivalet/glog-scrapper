{"altername_name": ["Anti-Matter Splatter"], "name": "Antimatter Splatter", "overview": "Antimatter Splatter (or Anti-Matter Splatter in the Rabbit release) is a side view single screen shooter where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, and your mission is to protect humans below you, who are moving across the screen. At the top of the screen is an alien who drops bombs and the bombs have to be shot before they land and kill any human it touches. Between you and the alien are four platforms that move either left to right, or right to left and when shot destroys part of the platform. Any gaps allows the bombs to fall through but when a platform is completely destroyed it appears whole again. If you are hit by a bomb or all the humans are killed then it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Nufekop Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PCUCGE1oNs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116636-antimatter-splatter\n"}
