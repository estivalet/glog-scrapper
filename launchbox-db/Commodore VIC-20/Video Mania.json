{"altername_name": [], "name": "Video Mania", "overview": "Video Mania is a shoot 'em up similar to Robotron: 2084. The game is played on a single screen and the player can move and shoot in any direction. Around, alien creatures roam and the player has to shoot them down before they collide with him. The only defence available is a football shaped electronic alien zapper that is thrown at the aliens. However, unlike Robotron, it's played with only one joystick and therefore the player can only shoot in the direction that he is moving. There are three different enemies. The evil eye which bounces off when hitting a wall, the walwoker which climbs walls when they hit and otherwise move in unpredictable ways and the killerbox which always follows the player. Each killed alien is worth 50 points and once all have been killed a new level is started with a larger amount of enemies. The player starts with three lives and after every 10th level the player gets a bonus life.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Software", "publishers": "Creative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167977-video-mania\n"}
