{"altername_name": [], "name": "Villain", "overview": "Villain is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. Today's life of crime isn't all high living and a villa in Brazil you know. These days a crook has to be in top physical shape to escape from the fuzz, especially around Pinner Way where P. C. Plod has his beat. Recently, he's become a real pain. He always seems to be able to keep up with you, however fast you run. He's making a life of crime sheer hard work. To escape P. C. Plod, the player must rapidly move their joystick left and right. The player can also jump, throw vacuums, or throw diamonds. At the start of each job, the player has a training session where they have 3 attempts to complete a 200 yard dash in the displayed time frame. This section can be skipped if deemed too difficult. During the actual theft, the player must stay ahead of P. C. Plod for 1000 yards. While doing this, they must jump over or use their vacuum on objects to clear their path. If the player hits an obstacle or is caught by P. C. Plod, they lose a life. The player can jump to grab treasure. If they jump and grab a bomb, they are temporarily filled with adrenaline and can run faster and jump higher. If the player accidentally grabs an alarm bell, surveillance floaters known as Big Eyes appear. These can be removed by throwing diamonds. Master Big Eyes resistant to diamonds appear after level 10.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "October 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interceptor Software", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV5z7picyoc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114174-villain\n"}
