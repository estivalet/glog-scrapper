{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Storm", "overview": "You take control of a ship piloting through space, destroying asteroids that appear in random places. This is accomplished by moving your crosshair over them and pressing the fire button. When you have destroyed enough asteroids without losing a life, they gradually move faster. Lives take the form of a damage meter at the bottom-right, and when this meter fills up red, the game ends.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Rabbit Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBy4NfAjzsk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167027-space-storm\n"}
