{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quackers", "overview": "Roll up! Roll up! All the fun of the fair! The object of this game is to kill four lines of targets consisting of space invaders, rabbits, and ducks before time runs out. In addition, you must kill melons that are sitting behind a moving brick wall, and you must shoot through the gaps in the wall to reach them. You have limited time, so you need to kill all of them quickly or you will lose one of your four lives. Once you have shot all targets, you are treated to a scene involving a turtle dancing across the screen and then the game proceeds to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interesting Software", "publishers": "Rabbit Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpsXNr8mmq0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130151-quackers\n"}
