Your job is simple: save humanity from their own creation -- the ROBOTRONS! The gameplay is pretty unique for the time. You can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you've got to kill all the robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vid Kidz", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron:_2084", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4PpMn-6bI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115203-robotron-2084\n"}
