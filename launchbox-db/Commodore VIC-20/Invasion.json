{"altername_name": [], "name": "Invasion", "overview": "Invasion is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The player is under attack by alien vessels, which approach one at a time from the left, attempt to grab a power supply from the right of the screen, and then escape. The player must defend themselves by launching missiles from the top and bottom of the screen, one at a time, to try to destroy the alien vessel. The player receives 10 points for each vessel destroyed, and it's game over when all 4 power supplies are lost. The player receives a final rank for their defensive performance.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Elder", "publishers": "Nufekop Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369091-invasion\n"}
