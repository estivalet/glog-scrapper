{"altername_name": ["Rodman"], "name": "RodM\u00e4n", "overview": "Guide RodM\u00e4n around the maze, collecting the round purple things. Also collect the yellow diamonds because they're bombs and can be used to blow up RodM\u00e4n's enemies. When moving around, avoid the things which are also moving around, as they aren't very nice. Apparently, the things that move are called \u25cf Naughtly Nic \u25cf Dirty Tim \u25cf Desperate Dave \u25cf Spurious Pete \u25cf Teflon Timmy Although no one knows why. There are three levels, and each level has three screens: \u25cf Garden \u25cf House \u25cf Basement Giving a total of nine unique screens.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "March 25, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mika Ker\u00e4nen", "publishers": "The Future was 8bit", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPFIbXGOew8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156874-rodman\n"}
