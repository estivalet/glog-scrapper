{"altername_name": [], "name": "H3lp B0dg3", "overview": "Help \"b0dg3\" through the 20 levels, collecting the electronic components he needs to complete his mega project. But, the enemies have scattered his components around the 20 levels, and are not too keen on b0dg3 getting them back. There are four components to collect per level, and once collected the four, head for the flashing exit to go to the next level. There are tunnels that take b0dg3 from left to right or vice versa for short cuts or to get out of the way of baddies. There is a time limit on each level that gets slightly quicker as b0dg3 progresses through the levels. When the time limit gets too low, a warning will sound and b0dg3 will also flash red. A shot enemy may drop either more firepower ( as you only have so many bullets, so need to replace them where possible ), an extra life or a timer freeze. Score, lives, remaining bullets and timer are at the bottom of each screen. B0dg3 can only fall so far off platforms so be careful. Mind the spikes. Collectables can't be picked up by jumping up below them, you have to be on the same horizontal level ( it would be too easy otherwise! ). Similarly a similar thing applies to hitting the baddies ( it would be too hard otherwise! ). Points are scored for collecting items, shooting baddies, completing level before timer run out so receiving a timer bonus.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "July 17, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Derek", "publishers": "Reset64 Magazine", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369336-h3lp-b0dg3\n"}
