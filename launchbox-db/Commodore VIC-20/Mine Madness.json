{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mine Madness", "overview": "A mine full of abandoned gold is something you've always dreamed about. But now that you've found it, it's more like a nightmare than a dream. You hurry around the mine, trying to get the gold to the surface, while elevators travel eerily up and down of their own accord. As you try to climb into one, it shoots upwards at a hair-raising speed, and you are left standing on the edge of a gaping shaft. Be careful not to fall into it, as it's a long way down. The monsters roaming the mine will try to kill you if they catch you trying to take the gold, so have your gun ready to shoot. Rock falls bar your way, but you must get the gold to the surface quickly, or the mine's mysterious force will paralyze you and you will never get out. Can you save the trapped girl and become rich in this fast action 100% machine code game?", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thorn EMI Computer Software", "publishers": "Creative Sparks", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQJuuyilt8Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118883-mine-madness\n"}
