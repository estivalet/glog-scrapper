{"altername_name": [], "name": "Electra Sports Soccer", "overview": "Electra Sport Soccer is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20 The player controls a single soccer player that tries to push a soccer ball into a single net. The player moves in the cardinal directions, and the distance the soccer ball travels depends upon how fast the player pushes the ball. If the ball is pushed into a wall and bounces back to the player, the level is restarted. The player tries to score in the fewest possible kicks. There is only one level, and 4 levels of difficulty. Despite the game's name, this is more of a general action game than an actual sports game.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "K-Tek Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368713-electra-sports-soccer\n"}
