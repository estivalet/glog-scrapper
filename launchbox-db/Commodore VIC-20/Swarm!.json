Additionally other entities hunt the player as he contends with this attacking swarm.

There are 40 levels of increasing difficulty. Scoring is as follows: \u2022 Eggs.........................................1 point each. \u2022 Queen...................................200 points. \u2022 Dodoclaw..............100,200,or 300 points. \u2022 Android Wasp Swarm...............50 points per wasp. \u2022 Rhizopod and Rhizopus....indestructible. \u2022 Egg shells...............................50 points.
