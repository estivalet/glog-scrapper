{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rally-X", "overview": "In 1981 Commodore obtained a license from Namco to release a home version of the hit arcade game Rally-X. But the license only applied to Japan. Since the VIC never sold well in Japan, only a small number of these were released. But since it was a really good game, and not wanting to be limited by their license agreement with Namco, Commodore changed the car graphics to be a cat and mouse and released the game worldwide as VIC-1910 Radar Rat Race. Use your radar to hit the course checkpoints and shoot for a high score! Players control a car and dodge pursuing red cars while collecting flags. Stall the red cars using a smokescreen when they get too close", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156872-rally-x\n"}
