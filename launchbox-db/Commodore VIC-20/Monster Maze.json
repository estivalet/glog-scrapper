{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monster Maze", "overview": "Monster Maze is a Pac-Man variant played from a first person perspective. The player has been trapped in a chamber of horrors where he is being chased by mutated monsters who want nothing more than to put their teeth into human flesh. Throughout the corridors of the maze the player will find gold bars lying around that he can collect. He can also find vitamins which allows him to kill the monsters. When charged by the vitamin the monsters will automatically be killed when the player moves into the same square as them. If the player would not be charged he would instead lose one of his nine lives. The maze consists of multiple levels. When the player is done with one he can move to the next by jumping into a hole which will take him deeper into the maze. As the player progresses the difficulty will increase with him.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert A.
