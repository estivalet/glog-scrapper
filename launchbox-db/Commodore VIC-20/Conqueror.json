{"altername_name": [], "name": "Conqueror", "overview": "Conqueror plunges you into medieval Europe, where land and men were divided among kings. There were serfs and soldiers, trades made at the marketplace, and battles fought over land. The land was divided into kingships owned and ruled by lords. If it was to their advantage, they would attack a neighboring kingship. But always, they had to defend their own holdings. Assume your position as lord of a kingship. Eventually, one king will come to rule the entire land, and become Emperor. Maybe that will be you.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computer Knowledge", "publishers": "Computer Software Associates", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-_HcWqWV6I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118234-conqueror\n"}
