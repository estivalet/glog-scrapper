{"altername_name": [], "name": "Video Vermin", "overview": "Video Vermin is a 1-player Centipede clone for the VIC-20. Your once-peaceful garden is being invaded by a horde of hungry vermin. Shoot them, and their fallen bodies sprout a barricade of mushrooms to conceal more swarming raiders. Snails oil a path on which the vermin slither erratically toward you. Dropping butterflies leave a trail of mushrooms in their wake, and pouncing spiders, ants, beetles, and fleas infest the area. One vigilant gardener strikes first. If he's destroyed by the fatal touch of the invaders, two more defenders lie in wait to take his place. If the third gardener succumbs, and you have 10,000 points, another gardener will emerge to help you save the garden from devastation.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Wacker", "publishers": "UMI (United Microware Industries)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVUovRd9rk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149390-video-vermin\n"}
