{"altername_name": [], "name": "Omnitron", "overview": "Omnitron is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The year is 2052, and man has created a race of indestructible robots. These omnitron robots are attempting to rule the world, and it is up to you to stop them. The player and one or more omnitron drones move about the field looking to collect enertron crystals. If the omnitron drone contacts a crystal it electrifies the playing field, killing the player. If the player contacts a drone or a green nuclear explosive device, they also lose a life. These nuclear devices continue to appear on the screen, and the player must survive 45 seconds to advance to the next stage. If the player stays in one place too long, the omnitron sentinel appears, which chases the player and is very difficult to avoid. Each level has more or faster moving drones, and the player starts with 3 lives.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Parker", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nmPFyFBaHQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168713-omnitron\n"}
