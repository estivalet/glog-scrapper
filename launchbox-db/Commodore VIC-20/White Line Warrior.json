{"altername_name": [], "name": "White Line Warrior", "overview": "White Line Warrior is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. You are Obi Wan Wyatt, and just received a message from Astroscan Intelligence that long range scanners detected a large fleet of Red Line Axel Fighters of the Imperial Fleet approaching. Computer analysis of their current course indicates their target is Earth. They will try to obtain the sub-atomic \"Spaze\" area at the Earth's core. Only the sub-atomic White Line Warriors can stop the invasion. The player controls a small line on the screen that moves in the cardinal directions. The goal is to move the line as long as possible without hitting the edge of the screen or other lines. The longer the line grows, the more points the player scores. If the line grows long enough, the player advances to a new level with a faster moving line.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "June 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "VICTAPE Computing", "publishers": "VICTAPE Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168716-white-line-warrior\n"}
