{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cavern Fighter", "overview": "Are you willing to plow through six levels of asteroids, alien ships and defense installations, and finally a Dicator's Lair, so as to save the sleepy English town of Watford? If not, you might be better to pass on this Scramble-inspired shoot 'em up. The caverns you fly through have the standard zig-zag walls, which must be avoided. There are no mid-level restart points, and only three lives, which makes things tougher.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darrell Etherington", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_jTcNM73MI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126937-cavern-fighter\n"}
