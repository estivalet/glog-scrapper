{"altername_name": ["Hau den Lukas"], "name": "Mole Attack", "overview": "Mole Attack is one of the earliest computerized Whac-a-Mole variants. Gameplay should be clear: Moles randomly pop out of several holes (arranged in a 3x3 grid), and you can hit them using the right keyboard key (one for each hole). The sooner you hit the mole's head, the more points you get -- but if you hit the mole's buttocks (yes, them buggers sometimes pop up that way), you lose points. After 60 seconds, the game ends and your score is shown.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_Attack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mHWByQICqw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114126-mole-attack\n"}
