{"altername_name": ["Space Pirates"], "name": "Space Pirate", "overview": "Space Pirate is a 1st person shooter where you control a cross-hair on a single screen viewed from an elevated angle. Aliens appear one at a time from the back at the screen and move downwards in random patterns and you must blast a certain amount to move to the next level. If an alien reaches the bottom of the screen then it appears at the top again. You only have a limited amount of ammo which cannot be replenished and it is game over once you have run out of ammo. Each level also has to be completed before a bonus timer reaches zero and if it does reach zero then it is game over as well. Later levels sees another type of alien that attempts to remove ammo.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anirog Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Omega Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiEwSlhH-Oc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112628-space-pirate\n"}
