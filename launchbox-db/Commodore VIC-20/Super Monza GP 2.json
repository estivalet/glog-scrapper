More damage equals slower maximum speed. - \"Race against the clock\" mode has been replaced by a \"Championship\" mode, where you have to complete every race with a podium finish in order to continue. - PAL / NTSC. It will run on either a PAL or NTSC system, but it is designed to run on a PAL system. It will run slightly faster on a NTSC system and will play a little harder. - Joystick only.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "September 13, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AJ Layden", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDfZya88T5Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371972-super-monza-gp-2\n"}
