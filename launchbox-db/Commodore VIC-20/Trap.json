{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trap", "overview": "Trap is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The foundations of a wall have been laid, and you are trapped on the wrong side on the brick work. There is only one gap left through which you can get away. As you hurry towards the opening, your escape is impeded by the bricks placed in your path. Your only hope is escape to the next frame or the salvation of one of the safety zones. The player moves in the cardinal directions, and tries to quickly reach the exit point for the room. Random pieces of brickwork appear near the player, and if they're trapped on all 4 sides it's game over. The safety zones will temporarily remove all obstructing bricks. 200 points are awarded for reaching the exit, and 50 points for safety zones. Every 1000 points the game begins to fill faster. There are 5 levels of starting difficulty.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373594-trap\n"}
