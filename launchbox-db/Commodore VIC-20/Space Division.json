A number is written below the ship, which decreases by one every time you answer correctly. Get an answer wrong and you have to try again. Answer all 20 questions correct and the ship takes off, traveling so many miles into space. Distance into space is dependent on total of correct answers. The game starts over once the ship has traveled for long enough.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpoHli1ifMk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126134-space-division\n"}
