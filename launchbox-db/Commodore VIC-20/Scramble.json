{"altername_name": ["VIC Scramble"], "name": "Scramble", "overview": "Scramble (also known as VIC Scramble) is another Scramble game for the VIC-20, but with some alterations that make it stand out. As usual, you fly with a ship through a system of caves, but this cave lacks the usual roof. You shoot or drop bombs at the usual missiles, saucers and fuel pods, but in this version, you don't shoot and bomb simultaneously. Bombs are released by pulling back on the joystick with the fire button pressed. Of course, this means that you can't go back and forth as usual, instead your ship is glued to the back of the screen. While the scrolling is forced, pushing forward makes it speed up, so that you can fly away from missiles and other threats. As you go deeper into the caves, the border colour changes.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJxeOD_mciM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127175-scramble\n"}
