{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hopper", "overview": "A clone of Frogger where you must guide your frog across a busy highway to the city in the middle of the screen, then across the river to one of five safety homes at the top of the screen. Once all five homes are filled, you proceed to the next level where you do it all over again. Colliding with logs, buildings, or traffic results in a loss of lives, and the game ends when all of them are lost.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "July 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Kim", "publishers": "Rabbit Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQRAm8LRd60", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116622-hopper\n"}
