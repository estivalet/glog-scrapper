{"altername_name": ["Bomb Buenos Aires"], "name": "Blitzkrieg", "overview": "In Blitzkrieg, you pilot a small airplane and your mission is to bomb the city so you can land safely. It is a one-key game, so you don't control the plane, you can only drop bombs by pressing the spacebar. The plane moves from left to right across the screen, and slowly descends every time it wraps back to the left side. The higher skill level means the buildings are higher, thus more bombs are needed before you can land.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LLamasoft", "publishers": "LLamasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRifaYn_4Wg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145526-blitzkrieg\n"}
