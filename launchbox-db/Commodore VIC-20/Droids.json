{"altername_name": [], "name": "Droids", "overview": "Droids is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for multiple systems. The the vast, starless void beyond the Mnemos Nebula, your desperate struggle has restored some measure of control after the devastating effects of an ion storm. Just creeping along at sublight speed, you discover that your crew of droids has suffered phase inversion to their programming elements. Once friendly, helpful, and benign, they have become an all too real nemesis to your safety and control of the ship. The player controls a small character who can move in the cardinal directions, and fire in the direction they are facing. When a droid is shot, it dematerializes, and is teleported back to its cubicle. The goal is to repair, and then reactivate all of the ship's systems. The player does this by touching a system, and then returning to the elevator shaft on the left of the screen to repower, and they touching the system again. The player has 3 minutes to reactivate all systems and move to a more challenging level with more or faster moving droids.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Solitare Group", "publishers": "TG Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/llf2KC-ipks", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368338-droids\n"}
