{"altername_name": ["Star Defence"], "name": "Star Defender", "overview": "Star Defence (also released as Star Defender) is a Defender variant for the VIC-20, in which you commandeer a spaceship negotiating a landscape. Scattered about are aliens that threaten to abduct humanoids on the surface, and you must shoot at them with your laser fire. A humanoid is destroyed if an alien carries it to the top of the screen, you shoot at it, or it falls back down to the surface after you kill its captor. If one of them is carried off to the top of the screen, it will get destroyed and replaced by another alien that homes in on your location and tries to shoot you down. Throughout the landscape are stargates which take you to another part of it where an abduction can be witnessed. A limited supply of smart bombs can be used if the heat gets too much. Once you have killed all of the aliens, you proceed to the next wave. A radar can be activated by holding down [F3] and you can become temporarily invisible by pressing [Right Shift]. Hyperspace can be used if you press [Space]. You have a limited number of lives, and one is lost when you are hit by an alien or come into contact with their projectiles. Use all of your lives up and the game is over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kingsoft", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymJ4r0VslnY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126136-star-defender\n"}
