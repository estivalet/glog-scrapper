{"altername_name": [], "name": "Abductor", "overview": "Abductor is a side view single screen shooter where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, and you have to blast and destroy all aliens that appear in various formations above. Below your craft are six humans and you must stop them being taken by swooping aliens to the top of the screen and if they reach the top, they turn into skulls and fall down the screen. If you are hit by an alien or falling skull then you lose one of three lives but if you lose all the humans then it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "January 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Minter", "publishers": "LLamasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI0dBXjSieo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33005-abductor\n"}
