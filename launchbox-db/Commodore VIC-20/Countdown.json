{"altername_name": ["Countdown UXB"], "name": "Countdown", "overview": "A mad professor has planted a bomb in a sewer. You are trapped in his house and you have to escape it by collecting keys to open bars and get to the top of the screen, get through a jungle collecting keys to open the sewer and finally get down to the sewer, also collecting keys - but this time to defuse the bomb. The bomb will explode in a certain period of time, which the player can set at the beginning. 2 minutes, 2 minutes and 30 seconds, or 3 minutes. In each level there are bonuses for the player to collect. Collecting these will award the player with extra points. Also each level has different hazards. The house level has turrets and lasers, the jungle has man-eating plants that are dangerous if they open their mouths, but harmless if their mouths are shut and there also falling coconuts and the sewer has vine-esque plants that will enlarge and shrink. After the bomb is defused the game will start in the first level, the house level, again. Should the player not defuse the bomb in time the game will be over and the player can write his / her name for the high-score list.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "G.
