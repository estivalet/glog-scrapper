{"altername_name": [], "name": "JAB: Just Another Breakout", "overview": "From the developer's itch.io page: JAB: Just Another Breakout is a Breakout clone for the unexpanded Commodore VIC-20 (because what the world needs in the 21st century is another breakout clone!). Unfortunately it features unappealing eight pixel movement (character sized) for the ball and bat and not single pixel level movement. This gives the game a rather jerky look and feel. I attempted to implement pixel level movement and the bat eventually moved at pixel level, but by the time I tried to do pixel ball movement I was running out of unexpanded VIC memory fast. So I gave up and did what would fit.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "W E de Villiers", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgORAKv9Zww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155907-jab-just-another-breakout\n"}
