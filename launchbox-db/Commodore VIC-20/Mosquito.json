You are in a maze visible from the top. The game consists of four screens. To go to the next screen, you have to find a key. The maze sometimes goes black to harden your challenge. Find the keys to replenish your spray and hope for the best.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlantis Software", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3wR6UpsY68", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114147-mosquito\n"}
