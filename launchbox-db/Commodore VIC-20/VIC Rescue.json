{"altername_name": [], "name": "VIC Rescue", "overview": "VIC Rescue is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20 Your mission is to rescue the 6 stranded people on the planet's surface surface and return them to the orbital station. The orbital station moves slowly across the top of the screen, and the player must choose the correct time to release their landing module to try to sneak through a field of horizontally moving asteroids and land on one of the 2 flat landing pads below. These pads become smaller with each use. The player has limited fuel to slow their descent, which is used throughout all 6 rescue attempts. After loading a victim, the player tries to return to the the orbital station. At this time the asteroids become enemy ships. The player has the chance to shoot and destroy these, and must reach the opening of the orbital station. This sequence repeats until all rescues are complete or the player loses 3 ships.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interceptor Software", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=U0ZKB695w50", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135339-vic-rescue\n"}
