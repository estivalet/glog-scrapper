{"altername_name": [], "name": "Torg", "overview": "Torg is a variant of the arcade game Targ. Like the original game, it is a shoot 'em up set in a grid-like maze where the player starts out in the bottom right corner and ten enemies start from the top row. The objective of the game is simply to shoot down all the enemies while avoiding crashing into them. Crashes lead to one of three lives being lost. Once a level has been cleared the game moves on the next one and as the player progresses through the game it gets harder with more enemies.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank Lindsey", "publishers": "Human Engineered Software (HesWare)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=AWXlf0GjOnE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148019-torg\n"}
