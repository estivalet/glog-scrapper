{"altername_name": ["Dambuster!"], "name": "Dam Busta", "overview": "In Dam Busta, you control a scuba-diver armed with a harpoon, and your task is to blow up a dam. To do so, you need to get through two screens full of enemies that try to stop you from doing this. On the first screen, make your way to the entrance near the bottom-right, avoiding a swarm of barracuda that moves left and right in the water. In the second screen, kill the guardians who fire at you until you get a clear shot of a rocket. You are running out of air, and need to replenish your supply by swimming up to the surface, but a helicopter will stop you from doing this by dropping a depth-charge at you. If you manage to shoot the rocket, the guardians will be disabled, allowing you to place a bomb at the base of the dam. You must then return to the spot where you started and the bomb will be detonated. Do this three times and the dam will be destroyed. If you run out of air or get hit either a depth-charge or a guardian projectile, you lose a life and restart from screen one. Run out of lives and the game ends.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373426-dam-busta\n"}
