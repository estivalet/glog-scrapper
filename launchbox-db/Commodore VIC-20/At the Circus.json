{"altername_name": [], "name": "At the Circus", "overview": "In this educational game for one player, the object is to count the number of acrobats on the rope. There is a maximum of seven acrobats that can be on the rope. If you answer enough questions correctly, you are treated to a performance where the last set of acrobats will jump off the rope, onto the trampoline, and land on the ground. Getting an answer wrong results in the question being repeated. The game ends when two groups of acrobats are on the ground. The difficulty can be adjusted before the game starts, with higher ones having you count the acrobats that land on the ground as well.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kew Enterprises", "publishers": "Sumlock Electronic Servies Ltd.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hquhdHwvFVw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122700-at-the-circus\n"}
