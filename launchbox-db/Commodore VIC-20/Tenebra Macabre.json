{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tenebra Macabre", "overview": "Our favorite time mistress, Mega Meghan, has been locked in the dark crypt of Jurufranto Morante, the terror of Alicante. The only way out is to activate the magic candles on each screen. The bad thing is that, until she does, she will see less than the famous Pepe Leches. Luckily, the storm that has been unleashed outside is charged with lightning, and the sudden and momentary glare can help you see a little where to go... You gain a new life every 4 activated candles. Controls Use joystick in port 2, use left-right and fire to jump. Good luck!
