{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kosmic Kamikaze", "overview": "This is an update of Invader Fall, with the addition of terrain and a few gameplay tweaks. The object is to move your ship left or right, dodging invaders as they fall from the sky. A UFO will occasionally pass by, and if you don't move while it is on the screen, it will zero in on your ship and blast it. The invaders move faster as you progress through the game. Initially, the game ends when either you let an invader touch the surface or the UFO shoots you dead, but when you acquire enough shots you are given another chance.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "UMI (United Microware Industries)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofIYYYsa-w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167026-kosmic-kamikaze\n"}
