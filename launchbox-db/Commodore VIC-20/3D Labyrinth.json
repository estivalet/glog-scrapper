{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Labyrinth", "overview": "Released in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1984/12 (Issue #18), the goal of the game is simply to make it through the maze, which sounds easy, but isn't. You start in the northwest corner and must make your way to the exit on the southeast corner. The maze will be different every time you play, so tracing your path in one game won't help you in the next. You can choose to explore or to carefully plot your course, and all in your good time.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "December 7, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
