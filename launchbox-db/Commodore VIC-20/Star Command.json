The player controls a vehicle that moves laterally across the bottom of the screen. The vehicle fires vertically, and a crosshair determines the distance of the laser blast. Bow ties swoop into the screen for a split second before disappearing, and the goal is to blast these out of the sky. The player scores 100 points per hit, and the goal is to score as many hits as possible during the timed game.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373407-star-command\n"}
