{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cave In", "overview": "Game description: Cave In is an \"eat'em\" game in which you play a mole. The goal is to eat yummy (at least for the mole, which for whatever reason looks like a piranha) food in each screen while avoiding other animals (which look like a monster). You can \"cave in\", which means deleting your path which the enemies usually follow. While this game does borrow some aspects from games like Pac-Man and Snake, the game has no levels and, like in Berzerk, you can move freely around the screens.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greg Carbonaro", "publishers": "Spectravision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9aaa3gT6MY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118177-cave-in\n"}
