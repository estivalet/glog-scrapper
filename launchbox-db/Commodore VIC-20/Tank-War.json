{"altername_name": ["Tank War"], "name": "Tank-War", "overview": "In this Combat variant for the VIC-20, up to two players (blue tank for player one, red for player two) battle it out against each other in a field consisting of walls and other barriers. Each tank can move straight as well as diagonally. If one of the tanks are shot at, that tank will reappear at a random position on the field. There is no time limit, so whoever reaches ten points wins the game. In a one-player game, the computer takes control of the second tank.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Clark", "publishers": "Rabbit Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqzcNPp99hw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149391-tank-war\n"}
