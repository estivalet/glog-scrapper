{"altername_name": ["Code Maker & Code Breaker", "Code Maker + Code Breaker", "Code Maker and Code Breaker"], "name": "Code Maker/Code Breaker", "overview": "Twin pack of games from Creative Software: * Code Maker is a Mastermind variant where you have a set number of guesses to crack a computer generated code, given some clues to identify the correct colours (represented by letters in this version) and their positioning in the code, based on your previous guesses. * Code Breaker sees you turn the tables on the VIC-20 itself by allowing you to set the code and watch as the computer struggles to work out the correct sequence itself. There's a reaonable argument to be made that the game titles were accidentally swapped (as Code Breaker seems a more apt title for the game where you're trying to break someone's else code and Code Maker is more reflective of a game where you need to set the code yourself - this isn't confirmed anywhere though!)", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Creative Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166807-code-makercode-breaker\n"}
