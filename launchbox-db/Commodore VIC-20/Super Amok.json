Each room is inhabited by a number of robots that have run amok and are trying to kill the player. In addition to the robots the player also has to avoiding running into walls that will kill him upon contact. The robots have different colours (green, blue, red, black) that indicate how many points they are worth. Green are worth only five points while the black ones are worth 35.
