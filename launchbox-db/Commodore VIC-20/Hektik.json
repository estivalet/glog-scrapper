{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hektik", "overview": "In Hektik, the object is to destroy all the monsters on screen that chase the player around the level, based on the arcade game Space Panic. This can be done by digging holes in the walkway of enemies on screen, then wait for a monster to fall into it, then fill up the hole. This makes the trapped monster fall down to the next level and be killed. There are two types of monsters. Hunters are red monsters who can fall down only one level and get killed. Chasers are green monsters that require falling down multiple levels before getting killed. The player's oxygen depletes as they progress through the levels. Players advance to the next level when all the monsters in the level have been killed.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kelvin Hepburn", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVQ6T2w5fVs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116620-hektik\n"}
