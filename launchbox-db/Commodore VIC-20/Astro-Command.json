{"altername_name": ["Astro Command"], "name": "Astro-Command", "overview": "Astro-Command is similar to Missile Command, as you have to protect cities from getting destroyed. How you do that? Well, unlike Missile Command, you have your missiles on the RIGHT side. But like in Missile Command you aim where you want to shoot and then press the fire button. Beware of aliens, which will not only destroy one house, but an entire city!", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Comm*Data Computer House", "publishers": "Comm*Data Computer House", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIU5RHSf-oQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116637-astro-command\n"}
