{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Maze (Mastertronic)", "overview": "In 3D Maze you're a 'spaceman' who, on a routine trip back from Mars while in orbit around Venus, is accidentally beamed down into a distant space maze somewhere in the alien terrain. All you have to survive is a space suit, oxygen tank (with a limited oxygen supply), a compass and a map of the maze. You must make it to the exit of the maze before your oxygen supply runs out! The game is a simple graphical 1st person maze game. Each move subtracts 1 from the total of your limited oxygen count.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Darling", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N3UMI1z9jc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107762-3d-maze-mastertronic\n"}
