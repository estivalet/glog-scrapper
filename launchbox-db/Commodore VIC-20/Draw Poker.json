{"altername_name": ["Draw Poker 1"], "name": "Draw Poker", "overview": "Draw Poker allows the player to play the casino game with the same name. Each round the player receives five cards from a standard deck. Similar to Yahtzee, the player can select a number of cards to replace. This can be done only once. The better the results of the player's hands (the typical poker sets apply), the higher the multiplier for the player's bet. Skill enters play, because the game simulates an actual deck, and the deck is only shuffled once all cards have been played. Thus the player can try to count cards to calculate of the odds are in his or her favor.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135277-draw-poker\n"}
