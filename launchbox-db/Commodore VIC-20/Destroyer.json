{"altername_name": [], "name": "Destroyer", "overview": "A Depthcharge clone where the object is to wipe out as many enemy submarines as you can before time runs out. Wiping out submarines awards you with points, but the number of points you earn depends on where in the water they are. For instance, wiping out a submarine on the bottom level awards you with the most points than the one closest to you. While shooting at the submarines, you also need to protect yourself from both their harpoons and the airplane dropping bombs as it passes by, because if you come into contact with any of these you will lose one of your lives. Lose them all and the game ends.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sumlock Electronic Services (Manchester) Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHLPUyrSCM4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130574-destroyer\n"}
