{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slap Dab", "overview": "Slap Dab is a top down arcade action game where you take the role of Sam the Painter. The point is simply to paint the whole screen. However, it's not as simple as it sounds when you are chased by undercoat monsters who want nothing more than to pull the bristles out of Sam's brush. The monsters can only move on painted areas. From time to time Sam must return to the paint-pot to refill his bucket. Therefore it's necessary to leave some unpainted areas, so you can return to the depot. Naturally, as you progress in the game it gets harder for each new level. You have three lives to your disposal before it's game over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darrell Etherington", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIbAOMPxpSc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144548-slap-dab\n"}
