{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rainbows", "overview": "In Rainbows, the player is presented with three letters in a sequence and the start of a rainbow below. It is up to them to guess the next three. If the player has guessed correctly, the rainbow continues to build up until all six letters are displayed. If the player guesses incorrectly, then they are given clues (\"cool\" and \"warm\"). The game ends when either the rainbow is complete or the number of goes have been exceeded, which is four or six depending on the difficulty level they selected.
