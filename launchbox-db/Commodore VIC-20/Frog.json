The player attempts to navigate a frog across a busy highway and a river while avoiding being hit by cars or falling into the water. The player starts with 3 lives, and moves in the cardinal directions. Cars and logs move horizontally across the screen, and turtles only stay on the surface a short period of time. If all 6 zones at the top of the screen are filled, the player advances to a more difficult level.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373468-frog\n"}
