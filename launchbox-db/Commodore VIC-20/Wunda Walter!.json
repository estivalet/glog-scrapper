{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wunda Walter!", "overview": "Wunda Walter! is a fast-paced side-scrolling action game where the player controls a balloon-like character called Walter. The game takes place on the planet Plato where venomous energies called fuzz-balls have created chaos. It is up to Walter to eliminate these things by simply stepping on them. Walter starts out running on the ground and by holding the joystick button he will rise up in the air. Releasing it again will cause him to fall back towards the ground. The aim of the game is simply to make it across the levels while stepping on as many fuzz-balls as possible. The difficulty of the game comes from the various dangerous objects and rough surfaces that have to be avoided. Any contact with these will cause Walter to burst. Walter has five lives and when they are used up it's game over. There are four levels with different landscapes and obstacles.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Keith Harvey", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KXsawCSCT8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114157-wunda-walter\n"}
