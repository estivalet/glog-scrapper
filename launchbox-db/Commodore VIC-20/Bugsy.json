{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bugsy", "overview": "Bugsy is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The player moves about a large grid trying to collect all the yellow mines before 99 time units run out. Each time a yellow mine is collected another one appears on the screen, and each collected mine supplies about 10 more time units on the clock. Purple mines can be collected for bonus points and time. Each square becomes impassable after being moved on. A yellow bug moves randomly about the screen and can kill the player, but also restores some squares to passable. Red mines must be avoided. The player starts with 3 lives, and each level of difficulty requires more mines to collect.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stephen Dickson", "publishers": "Mr Chip Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168697-bugsy\n"}
