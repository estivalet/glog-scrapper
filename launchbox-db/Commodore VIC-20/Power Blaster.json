{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Blaster", "overview": "Power Blaster is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The year is 2201. The universe has been ravaged by many wars. The Venusians seek peace with the Martians, and have summoned the Martian Overlord to peace talks. You are the commander of a Venusian Defence Force patrol ship. Your mission is to blast the remote control high power bombs which are being planted by the Martian Overlord's personal attack force just in case the negotiations break down. If they break down the Overlord will blast Venus to atoms after he has reached a safe distance from the planet. You must not shoot the Martians unless you have no choice. The player can move in 8 directions on a maze with the goal to clear all bombs. Each time that the player shoots three Martians they get more frantic and lay the bombs faster. All bombs are replaced on the screen when this happens. The player can use hyperspace when surrounded by Martians to warp to a new area. It's game over if the player is hit by a Martian.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Ratcliffe", "publishers": "Romik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0HuZiBbCcE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369791-power-blaster\n"}
