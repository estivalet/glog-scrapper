{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Plague", "overview": "Alien Plague is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore VIC-20. The greedy aliens have launched a surprise attack against Earth. You must protect the Earth's remaining energy cells as best you can. The player controls a small ship at the bottom of the screen that moves laterally and fires vertically. Alien vessels attempt to swoop down and grab the energy cells and pull them to the top of the screen. If an alien is shot, the energy cell returns to the bottom of the screen. Large centipede-like creatures leave long lines of barricades on the screen that must be destroyed. It's game over when all energy cells are stolen.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Computer Room", "publishers": "Bubble Bus Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omctey6Oe4Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126295-alien-plague\n"}
