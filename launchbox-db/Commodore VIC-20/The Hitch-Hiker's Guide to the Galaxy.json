{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "overview": "Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is an early text adventure based on the bestselling book, released years before Douglas Adams's better-known text adventure with Infocom. In it, you have to explore a quaint English village and even other planets to recover five artifacts from the books and return them to a key location. Commands are entered using a very basic two-word parser with minimal help or flavor text in the game. Whether you read the book, heard the radio programs, or watched the TV series, this adventure game is great fun and a great challenge too. What you get out of it depends on what you put into it. It could provide you with weeks of frustration!", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Chappell", "publishers": "Supersoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155318-the-hitch-hikers-guide-to-the-galaxy\n"}
