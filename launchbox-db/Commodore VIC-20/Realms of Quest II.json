{"altername_name": [], "name": "Realms of Quest II", "overview": "Realms of Quest II is a role playing game for the VIC-20. The sequel to the original Realms of Quest, the player once again must create a character and explore the fantasy world to defeat the wizard Nikaedor. Characters are automatically created on a new game with a random roll of strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Played from a top-down perspective, the player explores an overworld featuring a castle, dungeons, and forests. At the castle, the player can restore health, and gain a level if sufficiently experienced. Level gains bring higher hit points and mana points. Random combats appear in and outside of dungeons, and the player can attack or run each turn. Monsters become more difficult further from the castle or deeper underground. The player can find healing potions and orbs to aid them on their quest.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "System Four", "publishers": "System Four", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168746-realms-of-quest-ii\n"}
