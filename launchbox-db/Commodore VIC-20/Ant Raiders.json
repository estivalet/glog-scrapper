{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ant Raiders", "overview": "Ant Raiders is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The player controls a character at the bottom of the screen that moves horizontally and fires vertically. Only a single slow moving shot appears on the screen at a time. Ants move laterally across the screen until they hit an obstacle, and then move down 1 row and reverse direction. When an ant is hit it's trapped, leaving a mark on the screen. If this mark is again hit, the ant escapes and start moving again. Obstacles randomly appear on the screen blocking the player's shots. The player completes a level if all 10 ants are trapped before an ant reaches the bottom row. It's game over if an ant reaches the bottom.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stuart Hall", "publishers": "P.R.
