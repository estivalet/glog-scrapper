{"altername_name": [], "name": "Digger", "overview": "Digger is a single screen game where you must dig around the screen through the dirt to kill various creatures that are digging and trying to kill you. As you move around the screen there are rocks and when the dirt is removed underneath then you can push the rock down to hopefully kill a creature. You are armed with a gun which stuns the creatures for a short time. If you are touched by a creature or crushed by a rock then it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Benham", "publishers": "Mr. Micro", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBamkAJb0iI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145168-digger\n"}
