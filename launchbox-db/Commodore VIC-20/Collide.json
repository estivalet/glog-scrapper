{"altername_name": [], "name": "Collide", "overview": "Collide is a variant of the arcade game Head-On. Like the original game the player controls a car and has to collect all the dots on a race track that consists of four lanes. The car automatically moves forward counter-clockwise and an enemy (which here is a happy face) moves in the opposite direction trying to crash into the player. Changing lane can only be done at intersections located in the middle of each straight. Hitting a divider when doing so will lead to the player losing control of the car for a short moment. The player has three cars and when they have all been crashed the game is over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Elder", "publishers": "Nufekop Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B534KR2IkPQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115223-collide\n"}
