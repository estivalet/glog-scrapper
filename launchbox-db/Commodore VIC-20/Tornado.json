{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tornado", "overview": "Tornado is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the VIC-20. The Red Planet slips beneath the ship's gleaming hull. Behind, dust is kicked into the thin air from which it falls at an unnaturally fast rate. The ship is Tornado, a craft specially designed for use over the Red Planet able to maneuver fast and effectively in the thin atmosphere. Since the start of the Colony Wars, ships such as these have been patrolling outlying areas and in some cases have had to destroy war-like clans which still held to the old ways of separation and destruction. Now the end of the Colony Wars is in sight, a final pocket of seething hate has been located, and is about to be eradicated, The player controls a small ship that moves vertically, and fires horizontally to the right and drops bombs. Incoming Martian infrastructure and terrain scrolls from the right. The player must dodge incoming rockets while trying to destroy as much alien infrastructure as possible for bonus points. The player starts with 3 lives.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chartec", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Fo1ATYjc0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114181-tornado\n"}
