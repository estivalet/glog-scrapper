{"altername_name": ["Paratrooper"], "name": "Paratroopers", "overview": "Paratroopers is a single player shoot-em up game in which the aim is to achieve a high score. The player mans a ground based gun. Helicopters and bombers fly overhead dropping paratroopers and bombs. The player must prevent these from landing as, when enough of them have made it to earth, they turn into a tank and destroy the players gun. Every shot fired costs points but these can be regained by bringing down aircraft and paratroopers.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antiram", "publishers": "Computermat", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114224-paratroopers\n"}
