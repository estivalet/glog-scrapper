{"altername_name": [], "name": "Interlox", "overview": "Interlox is a computer board game based upon Noughts & Crosses/Tic-Tac-Toe. Played on four interlocking squares simultaneously, the goal is to place pieces on a board to align 3-in-a-row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing the opponent from doing the same. Pieces are placed by pressing the button corresponding to the board position. In a 2-player game, the player with the most runs of 3 after all positions are filled is the winner. Versus the computer, the goal is to prevent them from getting a run of 3 while trying to maximize player runs of 3.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "June 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "VICTAPE Computing", "publishers": "VICTAPE Computing", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy5hBnL84N4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168720-interlox\n"}
