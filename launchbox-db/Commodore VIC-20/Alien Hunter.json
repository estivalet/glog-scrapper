{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Hunter", "overview": "Alien Hunter is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. Eliminate all alien drones in your sector of space by blasting them with laser bolts fired from your ship. The player's ship can move in the cardinal directions, and has limited fuel to blast the green aliens that appear. Green aliens move to a new location on the field every few seconds, so must be destroyed quickly. The player must shoot or avoid the purple enemies that appear. The player starts with 500 fuel, and fuel rapidly depletes. The player restores 100 fuel every several green enemies shot. There are 9 levels of starting difficulty, which control fuel depletion and how long an enemy stays in one place. The game ends when the player hits 3 enemies or runs out of fuel.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abrasco", "publishers": "Abrasco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168715-alien-hunter\n"}
