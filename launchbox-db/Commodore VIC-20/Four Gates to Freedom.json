{"altername_name": [], "name": "Four Gates to Freedom", "overview": "Four Gates to Freedom consists of two parts: an action game and an adventure game. The action game has to be played first and after completing it the player is given a code that is needed to start the adventure game. The game tells the story about a star cruiser that when exploring a far away planet is captured by a race of warrior ants. The crew and twenty scientist that were on board are drugged for future use as food for ants. The player's task is to destroy the four gates of the title and gain entry to the catacombs were the captives are held. The action game is a fixed screen shoot'em up where the player controls a space craft down the bottom of the screen. Above there are a red and a blue wall that protects the four gates at the top of the screen. There are four levels and in each one or several of the gates have to be destroyed but first a hole has to be blown through the walls. At the same time there are various enemies that can be shot (except one which has to be avoided). To make things harder enemies that are shot send out debris in multiple directions that can also kill the player. The second game is a text adventure. The player enters directions (north, south etc.) to move around while interaction with the scenes is done by entering verbs such as go, take, use etc. Clues for the adventure game are given for each level completed in the action game.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Wickes", "publishers": "Phoenix Software Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnLxSAnz3bg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114189-four-gates-to-freedom\n"}
