{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rat Hotel", "overview": "In Rat Hotel the player takes control of a rat and has to eat cheese while not being caught by Waldo, a rat hating maintenance man. It takes place at Hotel Paradisio and on each of the hotel's floors the rat has to eat all pieces of cheese to be able to take the elevator to the next floor. At the same time it has to watch out for Waldo and the traps that he has placed all over the hotel. Any contact with Waldo or a trap will lead to one of three lives being lost but an extra one is granted after 10,000 points. There is a time limit too as the rat only has three minutes to move from the top to the bottom floor. The colour of the cheese changes over time and it's important to not eat it when it's black as this will paralyse the rat. However when it turns to blue it's worth double points compared to the orange one. Once the rat has eaten the big cheese in the basement the level has been completed and it will move on to a harder one. The difficulty level can also be chosen before starting the game.
