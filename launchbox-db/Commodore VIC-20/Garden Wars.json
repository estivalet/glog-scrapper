{"altername_name": [], "name": "Garden Wars", "overview": "Garden Wars is a fast paced, single-screen 8-way maze shooter, in which you play a rodent. Similar to Berzerk and other similar early maze shooters. Your goal? Earn as many points as possible by shooting and collecting stuff in a static, fixed-screen maze. However, the game is original due to the variety of on-screen stuff. There are some monsters (snakes, toads, centipedes, spiders) which you need to shoot, and of course canl kill you. There are flashing items you need to pick up (for points only); if you accidentally shoot them (which will happen due to the speed of the game), they will disappear and reappear elsewhere. Finally, there are small yellow spider eggs which, if not destroyed, will hatch small yellow spiders, and these spiders will, if not destroyed, finally evolve into blue spiders, which you can not destroy, only paralyze for a while and then there are also black spiders, which are invincible.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rick Madge", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYNNJd9GEMQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105858-garden-wars\n"}
