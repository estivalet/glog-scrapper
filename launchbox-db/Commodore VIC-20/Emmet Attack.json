{"altername_name": [], "name": "Emmet Attack", "overview": "Emmet Attack is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The player controls the turret of an attack vessel that must defeat the incoming Emmet force. The screen scrolls laterally if the turret is moved off the edge of the screen. Spider-like Emmets move laterally across the screen starting at the horizon until they reach a mountain and hide. They then later appear slightly closer to the bottom of the screen, and repeat this pattern. The player must destroy 10 Emmets before they reach the bottom of the screen, and then advance to a level with faster moving creatures.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Commodore Business Machines (UK)", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369340-emmet-attack\n"}
