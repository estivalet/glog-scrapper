{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cheesy Trials", "overview": "You control a laboratory cloned Mouse called Echo who must partake in experiments for the reward of some Cheese. Each of the experiments is played within a 2D platform styled game, and as you work out the safest route to the cheese, more of the level will appear, or will be altered. And each nibble of Cheese must be collected within a short time limit. Once all of the cheese bits are had, an exit appears so that Echo may go to the next experiment, or even retry an experiment to see if a safer or better route is to be found.
