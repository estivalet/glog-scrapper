{"altername_name": [], "name": "JetPac", "overview": "The game world is presented in a horizontal wraparound and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in instalments scattered around the map), and then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is broadly repeated. In addition, the player has to defend themselves from the planet's aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above. After the first level, the rocket stays assembled and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement has to be built before it can be re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "May 2, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Stamper", "publishers": "Ultimate Play the Game", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpac", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN096U4setY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32253-jetpac\n"}
