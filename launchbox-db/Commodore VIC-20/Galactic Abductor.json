{"altername_name": ["Galactic Abductors"], "name": "Galactic Abductor", "overview": "Galactic Abductor(s) is a sci-fi shoot-em-up inspired by the game Stratovox originally conceived for the arcade platform. The player commands a tank armed with a laser cannon that can fire upwards or laterally for both sides depending on the conjugation of keys. The background of the game happens in a planetary surface where the tank is located and where on the right side of the screen at the atmospheric level is situated a sort of satellite hosting several humanoid figures. Flocks of mechanical birds fluttering in the open try to hit the tank either with laser beams or by dropping capsules that will turn into deadly probes which will chase the tank in the ground until it's destroyed. But these are diversion tactics because their main purpose is to abduct the humanoid figures sheltered in the satellite. If one of the laser beams fired by a mechanical bird hits the tank, if one of the terrestrial probes collides with it, or if every humanoid figure present on the satellite is abducted, one of the player's life is lost. To shot down a bird two shots are needed, to destroy a probe either on sky or land one shot, and to release the humanoid entities from the claws of the mechanical birds an accurate shot directly at the figure is required. As soon as the shot accurately hits the figure, he will immediately and safely return to the satellite.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8QrM-KtVEc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126173-galactic-abductor\n"}
