{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blue Meanies from Outer Space", "overview": "In Blue Meanies from Outer Space the player is in charge of defending a starbase that is being attacked by these blue little cuboid creatures. To do this he uses six laser guns, three on each of the base's sidewalls. The meanies fall from the sky and the player has to shoot them down before they can do any damage to the base. Using the lasers cost energy and when the energy is out the weapons won't work. At times supply ships land with more energy. It's important to not shoot these down as it leads to a reduction of points. To fix the holes caused by the meanies the player can use a repair robot. This however costs a large amount of energy.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Duane Later", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGnoTfRBBTk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41163-blue-meanies-from-outer-space\n"}
