{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blitz", "overview": "In Blitz an airplane moves across the screen at a constant speed. When the airplane reaches the far right of the screen it moves to the left-hand side and drops down the height of one airplane. Below the airplane is a number of skyscrapers of varying heights. The player has to drop bombs from the airplane by pressing the space bar. Each bomb can destroy six floors of the sky scraper it hits. As the plane descends, the airplane can crash into any remaining blocks, so the tallest sky scrapers should be targeted first. The can only be completed by destroying every floor of every building and then landing safely on the flattened ground. The gameplay is extremely challenging, requiring excellent hand-to-eye coordination and near-perfect timing. It also offers very little margin for error and one missed opportunity will almost always end in failing a level. The game is unusual in that it requires the player to press only a single button to play - the space bar. This was the game that pretty much \"popularized\" the city bomber style game.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Commodore Home Computing Division", "publishers": "Commodore Home Computing Division", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-xiPNneGHs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114136-blitz\n"}
