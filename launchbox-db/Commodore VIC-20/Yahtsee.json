Players take turns rolling five dice, and each turn can choose which dice to keep. The player can reroll the remaining dice for 2 more rounds, keeping the five dice they prefer before choosing their scoring category. Scoring categories include 6 categories which include the sum of all ones to sixes. There is also 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, full house, a 4 dice straight, a 5 dice straight, yahtzee (5 of a kind) and chance (which is the sum of all dice). A bonus score of 35 is added if the player scores 63 points or more on the sums of 1 - 6. A game is finished when all 11 scoring categories have been used.
