{"altername_name": ["Strip' Em"], "name": "Strip'Em", "overview": "Strim'Em is a \"strip pokerish\" game for 1 - 4 players. While the theme is adult, the game was meant to be played in real life and the graphics were only to help players to remember how much clothing they had left. Each player is represented by a character on the screen. Each player starts with 6 points, each of which corresponds to a piece of clothing. Each turn, each player is asked to bid 1 point to the maximum number of pieces of clothing they have remaining. One of the 4 players is randomly chosen, and the winning player receives that many points or pieces of clothing up to 6, while the other players lose their bid. If all clothes are lost, a forfeit must be paid.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "VICTAPE Computing", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/374106-stripem\n"}
