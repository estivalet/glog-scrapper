{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon of Dance", "overview": "Dungeon of Dance is an old-school, but somewhat subverted, roguelike game for the unexpanded VIC-20. It has the classic genre elements: explore the dungeon, find food, armor, and potions that may or may not behave as advertised when imbibed. You'll encounter goblins to vex, wraiths to confound, and dragons to banish. The dragon holds the key to the door to the next level, and the only way to get that key is to best the dragon in a winner-take-all dance off! Find the Magic Mirror Ball to complete your quest. You need a good memory to match your opponents' moves, and it only gets harder as you descend further into the depths of the Dungeon of Dance!
