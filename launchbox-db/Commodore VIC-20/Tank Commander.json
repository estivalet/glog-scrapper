{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tank Commander", "overview": "You are a Tank Commander and your mission is to drive around the top view landscape in various directions and destroy all the enemies fuel dumps. As you drive your tank you must avoid the other enemy tanks as well as a jet-fighter that appears occasionally and bombs you. The terrain of the landscape consists of rivers, hills and trees with the rivers having to be crossed by bridges and the hills drove round. The trees can be fired on to remove or just run over them, and a road can be driven on but this attracts the enemy. Your ammo has to be watched as you only have a limited supply and if you are hit by the enemy then you lose one of four lives. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns to play when the other player is killed.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Sparks", "publishers": "Creative Sparks", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161113-tank-commander\n"}
