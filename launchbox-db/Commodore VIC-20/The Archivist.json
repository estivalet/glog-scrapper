{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Archivist", "overview": "The Archivist is a text adventure game in the classic 8-bit style, using one- or two-word commands to explore a world, solve puzzles, and collect items of historical import. In The Archivist, you assume the role of a steampunk-era collector working in the distant future. To you, the past and the future intermix, and you draw on your vast knowledge to attain interesting stuff, sometimes with narrow escapes and feats of ingenuity. The Archivist takes you to six time periods with over 50 rooms and dozens of items. Talk to everyone. Examine everything. Try not to get killed. To run it, you type SYS8192. The game requires 24K expansion in blocks 1, 2, and 3. Source: http://sleepingelephant.com/ipw-web/bulletin/bb/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10478 This is a text adventure game in the spirit of Scott Adams. That is, a two-word command parser. There are six \"basic\" verbs, which the engine handles by itself. These are GO (MOVE), GET (TAKE), LOOK (L, EX), DROP (DP), INVENTORY (I), WAIT (Z). There are also one-letter shortcuts for cardinal directions (N, S, W, E), up (U), and down (D).", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "September 25, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jason Justian", "publishers": "Beige Maze", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369355-the-archivist\n"}
