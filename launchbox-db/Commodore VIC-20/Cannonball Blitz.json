{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cannonball Blitz", "overview": "The player has to reach the flag on the top in this Donkey Kong clone. The guard sends the cannonballs down, so you must jump over them. Cannonballs roll on the floors which have hatches, that open randomly. Also cannonballs fall on the swings, so you have to use them for climbing to the upper floor. Finally you must catch the balloon to make your way up to the flag and to the next level. Moving options available are up, down, left, right and jump.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Blitz", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amqvdksMXns", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114325-cannonball-blitz\n"}
