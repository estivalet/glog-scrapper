{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyclon", "overview": "Cyclon is a space-themed reflex game that is similar to Midway's Space Zap. The object of the game is to survive as long as possible by defending your star base from enemy star cruisers and deadly satellites. The game has 99 levels of difficulty, and the player may begin at any level from 0-10. The player's star base is located at the center of the screen and enemies firing light missiles will approach from all sides. The star base is armed with lasers that can be fired in all four directions, as well as a limited amount of anti-matter bombs which destroy all on-screen enemies. Shields can also be activated to intercept enemy shots. Firing lasers and using shields will use up energy, and if the player's energy runs out, their star base will explode. If the player does not destroy enemies or intercept their shots, their missiles will inflict damage to the player's star base. Shields will be rendered unusable on any part of the base that is hit by an enemy. The star base will be vaporized if the enemy shots penetrate the reactor at the base's core. The player starts the game with three bases and will earn an additional one each time a level is completed. Additionally, any extra energy remaining at the end of each round will be converted to extra points. When all of the player's star bases have been lost, the game is over.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alan Pavlish", "publishers": "Boone Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tk-ukiDeSQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114129-cyclon\n"}
