{"altername_name": [], "name": "Doodle Bug", "overview": "Doodle Bug is a clone of the arcade game, Lady Bug, itself a close relative of the original Pac-Man. Just like the yellow pill-eater, you guide your sprite around a maze populated by nasties, and can only escape once you've eaten all the pills in the maze. You can choose how many monsters shall be at the first level and from then on every level will get one additional monster. There are no power pellets, instead you have to use wits to avoid the monsters. You can also use gates which you can turn around.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mastertronic", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM5hGHz4ZmI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114183-doodle-bug\n"}
