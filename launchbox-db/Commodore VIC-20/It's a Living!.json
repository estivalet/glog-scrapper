{"altername_name": [], "name": "It's a Living!", "overview": "It's a Living is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The player has taken a job working on the production line unloading boxes at an atomic bomb company. The player is positioned in the center of the screen while 4 conveyor belts move boxes towards the player. The player can move their character's hands in 4 directions to pick up boxes as they come. Boxes approach faster as the game progresses, but so does the player's payment per box. If a box falls off the end of the conveyor belt, an atomic explosion ensues, and the employee's contract is terminated.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373573-its-a-living\n"}
