{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starship Escape", "overview": "You are flying through space when suddenly a giant vessel uses its tractor beam on your little starship. You are sent to isolation along with your starship, but then you watch with your own eyes as crew members disassemble it piece by piece and scatter them around the vessel. Your object, then, is to search every room for the missing pieces, bring them back to isolation, and successfully rebuild your starship to escape. You are equipped with a blaster that carries infinite ammo, which you can use to deal with the different enemies you encounter. You can also find K9 to distract the enemies from you. If an enemy touches you, you are taken back to isolation.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sumlock Electronic Services (Manchester) Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYhfTkjDtHo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126174-starship-escape\n"}
