{"altername_name": [], "name": "Krazy Kong", "overview": "Krazy Kong is a single screen platform game based on the arcade game Donkey Kong where you have to rescue a girl at the top of the screen held by a giant ape over various levels. Starting on the bottom of the screen, you have to make your way to the top by climbing ladders, jumping gaps to reach higher platforms. As you climb the ape rolls barrels which take random routes and these can be avoided or jumped. Also on the screen are various items that can be collected for bonus points. If you touch a barrel or fall through a gap then you lose one of three lives and once you reach the girl then you go to the next level to rescue her once more.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darrell", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6gc3q6P4shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6gc3q6P4s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126178-krazy-kong\n"}
