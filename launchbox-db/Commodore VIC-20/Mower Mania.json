{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mower Mania", "overview": "Mower Mania is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. The player tries to mow a number of large yards with a push lawn mower. The player receives money for the amount of lawn mowed, but loses money depending on fuel used or when they damage the lawn mower by running over small obstacles. If the player hits a wall or a tree the lawn mower can be damaged or even destroyed. White and black rabbits hop about the lawn. Black rabbits cause the grass to grow back, and they can be safely run over with the mower. If a white rabbit is run down, a gravestone appears on the screen, and the player loses money. When a lawn is entirely mowed, the player moves to a new lawn.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ACME", "publishers": "Voyager Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126180-mower-mania\n"}
