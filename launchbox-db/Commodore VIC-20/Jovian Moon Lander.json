The moons of Jupiter are being mined for their resources. As a Moon Lander pilot your job is to travel to the larger moons of Jupiter to deliver critical medical supplies and other rare essentials to the different moon bases. You have limited fuel which gets partially replenished with every successful landing. You have lateral thrusters (joystick left and right - X axis) and a vertical thruster (joystick fire button - Y axis). The slightest contact with walls results in an explosive fireball.
