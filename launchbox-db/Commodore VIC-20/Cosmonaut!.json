{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmonaut!", "overview": "Cosmonaut! is a single screen platform game where your spacecraft is trapped on the surface of a planet on the top of the screen and you need to free it to take-off. You must make your way down to the bottom of the screen to switch of a tractor beam and then make your way back to your craft. To move down the screen you must use elevators that move up or down in gaps in the platforms but once on an elevator you can jump off. There is a patrolling robot on the surface and various Stormtroopers that move along each platform and fire lasers at you. If you touch the robot, a Stormtrooper, get shot or fall through a gap then you lose one of five lives and start back on the surface.", "platform": "Commodore VIC-20", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clifford Ramshaw", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-LLedO7sng", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126147-cosmonaut\n"}
