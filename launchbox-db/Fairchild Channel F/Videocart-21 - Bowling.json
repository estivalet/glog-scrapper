{"name": "Videocart-21: Bowling", "overview": "The object of the game is to knock down as many pins in 10 frames of bowling. The game gives the player an overhead view of a bowling lane. The player's bowling ball starts out moving left and right across the front of the lane. This has the player trying to get the lane position they want the ball to start traveling down. Once the ball starts rolling down the lane, the player can curve the ball left or right. Once the curve has started, it can't be changed further.<br><br>The game has 18 variations. They involve choosing the combination of number of players (1 or 2), then speed of play (slow, normal, fast, and fastest), and selecting a regular or split game. Regular games start with all pins standing in each frame while the split games have a random number of pins missing and the player has 2 balls to knock down the remaining ones.", "platform": "Fairchild Channel F", "release_date": "October 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.", "publishers": "Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34717"}
