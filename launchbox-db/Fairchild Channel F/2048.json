{"name": "2048", "overview": "A game for the Fairchild Channel F, written in F8 assembly language over the course of around 24 hours. <br><br>This is the classic modern-day mobile puzzle game 2048. The aim is to create a block containing the number 2048. When you move the controls in a direction, the blocks will move in that direction until they hit another block or the edge of the grid.<br><br>When a moving block meets a stationary block of the same value, they combine to create a block with double the value, which clears space on the grid.<br><br>Every time you make a move a new block is randomly placed on the grid, usually this will be a 2 but sometimes can be a 4. Should the grid fill up and there are no adjacent blocks of the same value to combine, the game is over and you will need to press the reset button.<br><br>Game Modes :<br><br>-   2048 - the game finishes when you achieve a block with a value of 2048. Try and achieve this in the quickest time possible!<br>-   Long - the game continues until you create the largest block possible of 131,072 or there are no more moves available.<br>-   Time - you have three minutes to achieve the highest score you can.<br><br>Game modes are selected based on which button you press on the title screen.", "platform": "Fairchild Channel F", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158486"}
