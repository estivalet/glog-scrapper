{"name": "Videocart-9: Drag Strip", "overview": "Know when to shift and you'll go the distance with these two racy games. But be careful... Redline your engine, and you wind up shiftless! (You've blown it!) 1-Player Drag Strip: VROOOM! Tach it up for a dynamite breakout. Then race the clock as you burn up the strip. (Beat our 7.70 ET and you're ready for Pomona!) 2-Player Drag Strip: He who laps last, laps best. Max your rpm's without redlining and you'll have the speed to lap your opponent at the top end. 99 wins puts you in the Winner's Circle!", "platform": "Fairchild Channel F", "release_date": "August 30, 1977", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.", "publishers": "Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29163"}
