{"name": "Centipede", "overview": "A brand new (as of 2021) conversion of Centipede for the Fairchild Channel F. This game was developed by Arlasoft (Nick Sherman) and released on his itch.io page.<br><br>The basic idea (as most of you know) is to shoot and avoid the centipede, as well as other enemies such as spiders, fleas and scorpions. <br><br>When a centipede hits a mushroom, he will drop down one row and turn around.<br><br>When you shoot a centipede, he will split and the second part will generate a new head. Shooting the head scores more points than the body.<br><br>Mushrooms can be poisoned (turned blue) by the scorpion and will cause the centipede to dive straight for the bottom of the screen.<br><br>Good luck!", "platform": "Fairchild Channel F", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153202"}
