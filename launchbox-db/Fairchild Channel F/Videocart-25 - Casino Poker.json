{"name": "Videocart-25: Casino Poker", "overview": "A simulation of the five-card draw poker variant. There is a computerized dealer and two more players (human or computer-controlled), and each one is dealt five cards. The players then take turns either calling or raising a bet (of up to $25) or, if they don't like their cards, they can fold. Once that round of betting is done, players can then choose to discard up to three of their cards in exchange for new ones, in an attempt to make a better hand. Another round of betting then takes place and, after that, all the players that didn't fold must show their cards. Whoever has the highest hand wins all the money in the pot.", "platform": "Fairchild Channel F", "release_date": "December 1, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.", "publishers": "Zircon International, Inc.", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiHD-GPv1dw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77464"}
