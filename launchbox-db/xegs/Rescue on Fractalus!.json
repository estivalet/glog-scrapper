{"name": "Rescue on Fractalus!", "overview": "1987 XE rerelease of Rescue on Fractalus! There are thirty levels you can choose from in this version instead of sixteen in the original release.<br><br>The game uses fractal technology to create the craggy mountains of an alien planet, where the visilibility was drastically reduced by the dense atmosphere. The player controls a fictional \"Valkyrie\" space fighter (converted for search and rescue duty) from a first-person view, attempting to land and pick up downed Ethercorps pilots. Some of these mountains hold anti-aircraft guns, which have to be avoided or destroyed. Due to the varied terrain, the direction finder has to be used to locate the pilots, whose visual beacons are often masked by mountain ridges.", "platform": "Atari XEGS", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lucasfilm Games", "publishers": "Atari Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbZ-chrOgGg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73736"}
