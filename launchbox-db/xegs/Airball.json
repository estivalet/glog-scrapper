{"name": "Airball", "overview": "You have been turned into a ball of air with a slow leak by an evil wizard. You must find the Spellbook and the ingredients for the spell. Without these, you will never turn back into a human again.<br><br>These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.", "platform": "Atari XEGS", "release_date": "January 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MicroDeal Ltd.", "publishers": "Atari Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ6JvXSnm0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29889"}
