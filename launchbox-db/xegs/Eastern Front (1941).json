{"name": "Eastern Front (1941)", "overview": "A strategic turn-based wargame for the Atari 8-Bit computer line. Eastern Front puts you in charge of the German armada as they start their infamous Russian campaign, or as it was known at the time \"Operation Barbarossa\". The game is played from an overhead scrolling map that encompasses the entire eastern European theater, and from which you select your units and issue orders based on their action points and strength which are defined by their appropriate control zones. Isolate units, and their strength starts to go down proportionally.<br><br>Only 1-player mode is supported against an AI that actually processes its moves between turns, giving out finer solutions the longer the player takes to make his moves.", "platform": "Atari XEGS", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Crawford", "publishers": "Atari Corporation", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GA95PCdZfg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97203"}
