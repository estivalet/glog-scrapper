{"name": "Star Raiders II", "overview": "Star Raiders II is a video game released in 1986 for the Atari 8-bit home computers, and later several other home computers and game consoles. The game was originally developed as part of a tie-in with the movie The Last Starfighter, which featured an arcade game of the same name as part of its plotline. Versions for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit computers were developed in 1984, although those were never released. Later the tie-in was dropped, and the game converted into a sequel to Star Raiders by changing a number of gameplay elements. The gameplay remained quite different from the original Star Raiders.", "platform": "Atari XEGS", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari Corporation", "publishers": "Atari Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iabq8cSmYiE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34735"}
