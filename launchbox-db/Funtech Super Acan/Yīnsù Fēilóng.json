{"altername_name": ["Sonic Dragon", "Speedy Dragon"], "name": "Y\u012bns\u00f9 F\u0113il\u00f3ng", "overview": "Yinsu Feilong (Speedy Dragon) is a colourful platform action game comparable to the Sonic the Hedgehog series which was released exclusively for the Taiwanese Super A'Can. Playing as a determined-looking young man with a baseball bat, the player must make their way through six side-scrolling stages, each with a boss at the end that must be defeated. The boy can run quite fast by building up momentum, as well as charge up and dash forward in a burst of speed, much like Sonic's famous spin-dash. He can also use his baseball bat, always at the ready, to attack any foes he encounters. There are baseballs strewn around each stage, which give points when collected, as well as item capsules and springs that send the boy careening off at high speed. There is also a 3D bonus stage similar to Space Harrier in which bonus baseballs can be collected.", "platform": "Funtech Super Acan", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AV artisan", "publishers": "Funtech Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvAMWT9SnUA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55630-yinsu-feilong\n"}
