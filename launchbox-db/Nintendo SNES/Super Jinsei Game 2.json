The player selects an avatar and makes their way across the board, landing on either positive or negative event spaces. Depending on how they answer, the player can increase or decrease in stats and financial status or have nothing happen to them. The goal is to make the most money by the end of the game. The game supports up to four players, with any remaining slots taken by CPU opponents. The game sits between 1994's Super Jinsei Game and 1996's Super Jinsei Game 3.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 8, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "KID Corp.", "publishers": "TAKARA Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89990\n"}
