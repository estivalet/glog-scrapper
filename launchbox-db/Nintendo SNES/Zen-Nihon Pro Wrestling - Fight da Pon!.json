{"name": "Zen-Nihon Pro Wrestling: Fight da Pon!", "overview": "Unlike the other games in the series, Fight da Pon is a comedic/parodic take on the circuit, and features various AJPW wrestlers in a super deformed chibi style that exaggerates their personalities. The game features multiple modes, but the core battle system requires using cards at opportune moments. Each card depicts a type of wrestling move, such as a suplex or clothesline, and the player can use them to counter and overpower their opponent. The game's story mode(s) plays out like a board game with occasional bouts.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 25, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28958\n"}
