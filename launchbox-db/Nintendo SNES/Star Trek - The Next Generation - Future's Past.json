{"name": "Star Trek: The Next Generation: Future's Past", "overview": "The Mission: To uncover the mystery of the most powerful device in the galaxy--the Derandomizer. Long considered a mere myth, the Derandomizer returns from the past to threaten the future of the Federation. But, the Federation isn't the only one interested in it. The Romulans have crossed the Neutral Zone... and mysterious alien Chodak fleets are converging towards them. From the Bridge, chart a course to strange new world. There, you and the Star Trek: The Next Generation crew must pass the tests set forth by the Arbitrator, the force which controls the powers of the derandomizer. Captain Picard will offer guidance, but it's your decision who to take on each Away Team mission. Will you need Worf's strength? Or Geordi's special vision?
