{"name": "Galaxy Wars", "overview": "The aim of Galaxy Wars is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. This version has three game modes available. B&W and Color recreate the graphics and behavior of the original arcade game in black & white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behavior. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 13, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C-Lab", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26366\n"}
