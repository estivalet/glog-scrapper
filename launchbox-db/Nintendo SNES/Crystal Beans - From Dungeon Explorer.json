{"name": "Crystal Beans: From Dungeon Explorer", "overview": "Crystal Beans: From Dungeon Explorer is a top-down action-RPG and a Super Famicom exclusive entry in the Dungeon Explorer series, which was primarily a PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 franchise. It is a graphically reworked version of the second game, Dungeon Explorer II, and provides a similar arrangement of classes to choose from. As with Gauntlet, the inspiration for the Dungeon Explorer games, each class has their own configuration of stats but all without exception fire projectiles in fixed directions. One of the game's major new features is the inclusion of a world map, that allows the player to visit any dungeon once they become available and travel back to the castle town to regroup and report their progress to the King, which often unlocks the next available dungeon. In Dungeon Explorer II, the player had to travel through a series of screens to find each dungeon.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14317\n"}
