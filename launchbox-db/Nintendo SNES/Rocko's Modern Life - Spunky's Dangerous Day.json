{"name": "Rocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day", "overview": "Spunky...Spunky...SPUNKY!!! Look out! You've got to help me with Spunky, mate. He's on the loose in O'Town and he's got a knack for getting into trouble. O'Town can be a dangerous place, filled with tons of puzzling pitfalls. Down at Rock-O-Whey Beach, we'll protect Spunky from one-eyed pelicans, crusty crabs and other dangerous sea creatures. True fun in the sun! Steel-jawed, steam-belching contraptions threaten Spunky over at the Hill-O-Stench garbage dump. I hope you're quick minded! Through the neighborhood, we'll follow Spunky from treacherous treehouses to dingy basements, keeping him out of danger. Are you ready to face the Bigheads? Finally, we'll outsmart wild washing machines, tricky lint traps and grungy gripes to rescue Spunky from the depths of Laundryland. Please help Spunky survive the spin cycle! The only rest we'll get is when Spunky lies down here for a nice, quiet...Spunky? Hey Spunky? What in the blazes?!?!
