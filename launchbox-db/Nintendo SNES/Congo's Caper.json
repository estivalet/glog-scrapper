{"name": "Congo's Caper", "overview": "If you were a monkey, just hangin' out in the jungle with your chimp-chick, and a magic ruby fell out of the sky and zapped you both, turning you into half-humans, and a demon-kid swooped down and made off with your girl -- what would you do? You'd high-tail it after them and stop at nothing to save her, that's what -- 'cause you're Congo, the money-turned-superkid, and only you can uphold the law of the jungle! But it's more than a jungle out there -- your search for little Congette will take you from ghost towns to pirate ships to ninja castles to the belly of a Tyrannosaurus. This is no time for a banana-break -- you'd better get down to monkey business!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo%27s_Caper", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2DXxcEgNIw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/265\n"}
