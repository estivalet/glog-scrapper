{"name": "Super Shadow of the Beast", "overview": "Shadow of the Beast for SNES was never officially released. It's a port of the Amiga game, Shadow of the Beast by Psygnosis. The SNES version was being made by a company called IGS. Nintendo Power mentioned it being shown at Summer CES 1992 convention, and that it looked better than the computer versions of the game. A rom of the game exists, and it appears that the game is fairly complete. It plays similar to many platform adventure games like Castlevania or Zelda II.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "IGS", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5890\n"}
