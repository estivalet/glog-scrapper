{"name": "The Second Reality Project Reloaded", "overview": "Background information: So, what's this all about? \"The Second Reality Project Reloaded\" is not another new entry in the TSRP-series, it's a remake of the first part. The hack finally features a new overworld (people requested this for years) and of course, custom graphics and custom music. Besides that, not much have changed, most of the time the level design is the same as before. So, keep in mind that the original hack came out back in 2002, and back in the days you don't had the possibility to insert custom sprites, dozens of ASM-hacks and so on. So please don't expect anything groundbreaking here, it's still the same thing as it was before: a hack which is about level design and nothing else. But with that said, chances are if you enjoyed the original hack, you will love the remake for sure! Storyline: Bowser is back again, more powerful than times ago: He found a power source which let him rebuilt his Airship Fleet. Soon he plans on attacking the Mushroom Kingdom one time more! It's up to Mario to stop him!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 20, 2008", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FPI Productions", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VeuJUeXHQ4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106236\n"}
