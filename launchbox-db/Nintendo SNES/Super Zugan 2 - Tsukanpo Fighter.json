{"name": "Super Zugan 2: Tsukanpo Fighter", "overview": "Mahjong game based on the Super Zugan anime, about the student Hideyoshi Toyotomi and his severe misfortune whenever he is coerced into playing high-stakes mahjong with his three delinquent colleagues. The one light in his life, his buxom girlfriend Akina, is a lot more intelligent (and lucky) and tries desperately throughout the series to convince him to stop. It is the follow-up to Super Zugan: Hakotenjou kara no Shoutai, which was released earlier the same year. It allows the player to construct a four-person game out of one of the many characters from the anime and a setting of their choice. The game is distinctive for showing the opponents sitting around the table, remarking on bad plays and showing various emotions depending on how well they're doing.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Unknown", "publishers": "J-Wing", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90048\n"}
