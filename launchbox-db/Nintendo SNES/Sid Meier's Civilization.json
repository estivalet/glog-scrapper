{"name": "Sid Meier's Civilization", "overview": "What would you do if you were emperor? With Sid Meier's Civilization, you are the emperor. You control your own personal civilization. And build it any way you want. Don't like schools? Don't build any. Think the Romans were crude? Wipe them out. And when your advisors tell you what to do, you tell them where to go. Attack your enemies like a ruthless warlord. And if they're really a pain, nuke'em. You've got the power to take on the greatest leaders in history.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 7, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "MicroProse", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/dxVU1BIIrEM?t=159", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2416\n"}
