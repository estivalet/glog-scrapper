{"name": "So Little Garden", "overview": "So Little Garden was MetroidMst's entry for the A.N.T.I. contest held on Metroid Construction. It is relatively small due to limitations in the contest parameters. It also features custom music, custom items, custom bosses, and other strange and wonderful things. Difficulty is above average. This is a MetroidMst hack, so expect some difficult sections and/or bosses to appear.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 31, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MetroidMst", "publishers": "Metroid Construction", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfjKPXuDApk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162177\n"}
