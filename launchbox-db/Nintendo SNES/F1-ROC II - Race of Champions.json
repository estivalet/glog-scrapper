{"name": "F1-ROC II: Race of Champions", "overview": "OK race fans, you've seen the rest, now here's the best! Seta's new super DSP chip separates the men from the boys in this high speed Formula One racing tour. Drive real cars, like the FW14B Williams, Mclarens MP4/7, the F92 Ferrari, the V8 Ford-powered Benettion B192, and other Formula One racing machines. You'll start our in a prototype Group C car and must win on all 8 tracks to move up. Next you race in F3000 cars to develop the lightning-fast reflexes needed to survive Formular One racing. Finally, you face the real 1992 Formula One season drivers and their cars. On the 16 international course, it's a duel of nerves, skill, grit and nitro. This game blows the competition away. A new standard in racing simulation is born and F1-ROC II is it.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 5, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SETA", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_ROC_II:_Race_of_Champions", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/_KIwjD5L9ag?t=63", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3430\n"}
