{"name": "Super Mario World Annual Contest 9", "overview": "The 9th Annual Vanilla Level Design Contest Collab Hack of 2016 features 108 contest submissions, along with various staff, judge, and post-game levels. There are a total of 152 exits spread across 117 levels. While the levels themselves remain vanilla, we included various other ASM features such as score displays with reset functions, as the point of this collab is showing off the individual levels, and not to be restricted by the switch palaces one has already pressed. The over-world also features ASM shenanigans en masse, creating an experience you are sure to have never had before in a Super Mario World ROM hack. Taking all of these aspects into consideration, this is now the largest SMW hack ever made (more than 96 levels that would not fit into a regular 4MB ROM!).", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SMW Central", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG-o9dIlPBQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155674\n"}
