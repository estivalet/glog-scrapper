{"name": "RoboCop 3", "overview": "OCP is sending in Rehab Officers to clear the streets of Old Detroit, making way for the construction of Delta City. When ROBOCOP sees helpless families forced out of their homes as the bulldozers move in, he joins the resistance movement to battle the Rehabs! Armed with a new multi-weapon arm attachment containing a large-bore cannon and a smart bomb, plus a gyropack for airborne assault capability, ROBOCOP faces a battalion of ED-209s, tanks, heavy artillery and a new adversary, OTOMO. The odds seem impossible, but remember - you're ROBOCOP!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7eos4ac0nk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2789\n"}
