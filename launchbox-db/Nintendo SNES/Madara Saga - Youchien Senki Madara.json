{"name": "Madara Saga: Youchien Senki Madara", "overview": "Madara Saga: Youchien Senki Madara (\"Madara Saga: Kindergarten War Journal Madara\") is an RPG exclusive to the Super Famicom. The game features the Madara license, an anime and manga about the titular supernatural hero and his group of resistance members who attempt to take down a tyrant of the youkai world, but instead imagines four of the major characters as kindergartners in a regular city. As Madara, Seishinja, Kaos and Kageou, the player has to move across the world map - Konga City - completing various objectives. Each character has their own separate chapter and mission to complete. After completing all four episodes, the team takes on the anime's major antagonist Miroku in a janken battle. The game adopts an isometric perspective. The chosen protagonist walks along the street automatically, but the player can manipulate their route by interacting with objects and buildings along the street, such as traffic lights and signposts. By consulting the town map via the pause screen, the player must get the protagonist to their next destination before their health runs out.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nexus Interact", "publishers": "Datam Polystar", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91049\n"}
