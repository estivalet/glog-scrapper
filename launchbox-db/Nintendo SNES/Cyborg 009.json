{"name": "Cyborg 009", "overview": "Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling run-and-gun action game from BEC based on the anime and manga of the same name. The player can control up to three of eight cyborg agents for each stage, each of which has their own separate set of powers. The player can alternate at any time between the three agents they selected, though as all three share a health and \"SP\" bar (which determines how often they can use special abilities) there's little point to switching out a character if they are badly hurt. Cyborg 009 received a fan translation from localization group Aeon Genesis in 2004. The license also saw two other video game adaptations: A Mega CD game in 1993 and a budget PlayStation puzzle game in 2002 that played like BreakOut.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 24, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BEC", "publishers": "BEC", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_009#Video_games", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdYK6Ut8JtM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24162\n"}
