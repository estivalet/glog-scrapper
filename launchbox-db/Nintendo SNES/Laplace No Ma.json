{"name": "Laplace No Ma", "overview": "Laplace\u00b4s Demon is a Sweet Home-like RPG for the SNES. It takes place in a suburb of Boston in 1924. You can pick from one of six or so classes at the start of the game (Detective, Journalist, Psychic, etc) and you can recruit other members, and it plays a lot like a normal RPG. It also seems to be one of the first games to pioneer a limit-break like system, which is now in use in a lot of games :P The focus of the game leans heavily towards exploration. The max experience level is 10, and you get just as much EXP from solving puzzles and finding new places as you do from killing monsters. You also get most of your cash from photographing spooks and selling the pictures. It's a pretty neat game!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 14, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Group SNE", "publishers": "Vic Tokai", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_no_Ma", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zV6uQy324s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32980\n"}
