{"name": "Power Slide", "overview": "Power Slide is a cancelled game for the SNES and 3DO that had an \u201camazing\u201d graphic for its time. The Super Nintendo version was going to be one of the few games to make use of the FX chip. It was being developed by Motivetime. Another racing game by the name Power Slide was eventually released for PC but it doesn\u2019t seem to be connected to this game in any way. The car handling physics in Power Slide were very advanced for the time, as were the visuals. Frame rate was less impressive unfortunately. A playable demo of Power Slide SNES does exist and it was leaked thanks to Eludevisibility! The in-game screens dont look anywhere as nice as the original tech demo tough. The game would have probably been like Dirt Racer, the other SNES racing game by Elite, released in 1994. Power Slide was basically a rally game, with real rally cars, Dirt Racer was a more arcade style game. The 3DO and PC versions of Power Slide were being developed by Maelstrom Games for Elite.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Motivetime Ltd.", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92947\n"}
