{"name": "Tottemo! Lucky Man: Lucky Cookie Roulette de Totsugekii", "overview": "Tottemo! Lucky Man: Lucky Cookie Roulette de Totsugeki (\"Absolutely! Lucky Man: Assault on Lucky Cookie Roulette\") is an RPG/board game hybrid based on the Shonen Jump superhero manga Tottemo! Lucky Man, about an incredibly unfortunate schoolkid who gets crushed by an alien craft and merges with the intergalactic hero Lucky Man. Similar to something like Dokapon, the game is an RPG framed as a board game: To move Lucky Man, the player must hit a button that stops a roulette that determines how many spaces he can travel. Certain results occur depending on where Lucky Man ends his turn, from gaining bonus items to talking to NPCs to a combat situation. Combat plays out like a turn-based RPG, and Lucky Man with his fellow heroes Shouriman (Victory Man) and Yuujouman (Friend Man) fight against various unusual enemies. The goal of the game is to rescue Lucky Man's love interest Mit-chan from a mysterious kidnapper.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 30, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tom Create Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Bandai Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91035\n"}
