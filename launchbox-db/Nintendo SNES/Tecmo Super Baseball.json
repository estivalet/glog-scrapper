{"name": "Tecmo Super Baseball", "overview": "Officially licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, Tecmo Super Baseball is the most exciting game ever made for your Super NES. While most others can focus on only pitching and batting, Tecmo Super Baseball is the first to provide you with a realistic fielder's point of view. The field perspectives created by Tecmo's exclusive Flying Camera give you a feel of the game you've never experienced before. From the first pitch to the last out, you're in control of both the offense and defense, and right in the middle of the action with large graphic pitching and batting perspectives. Only Tecmo delivers real baseball action.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sculptured Software, Inc.", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5968\n"}
