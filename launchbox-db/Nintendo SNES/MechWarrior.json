If you're a better pilot than your adversaries, you'll walk away with money, salvaged parts from the wreckage of the battle and your life. Prove yourself in regular combat and you'll be ready to earn a full four-Mech lance, the weaponry you'll need to take on the Dark Wing, scourge of the Inner Sphere. Do battle as one of eight types of \"Mechs\" on a variety of terrains.
