{"name": "Captain Tsubasa V: Hasha no Shougou Campione", "overview": "Captain Tsubasa V: Hasha no Shougou Campione is another installment in the ever-popular series based on the Japanese anime \"Captain Tsubasa\". This particular installment is set during the \"World Youth\" arc and focuses mainly on Tsubasa Oozora's year in the Italian Serie A league and his time representing Japan in international competition. However, other characters in the series have their own minor stories as well. The main objective is to make it to the World Cup and conquer all opposition... including the ever-imposing and seemingly unbeatable Campione team! Unlike previous installments in the series, the gameplay takes place with the pitch in full view. However, other elements of the series are still intact: The player can still advance to the goal if there's no opponent in the way, and can stop the action at the appropriate time to make an action. If the player has the ball, he/she can pass, shoot, dribble, or etc. And when on defense, the player can either tackle, cut pass/shoot, or mark an opponent with the ball. Players can also compete in the All-Star mode, where they can set up custom matches against a second player or the CPU, pick a team (from Club football or National League teams), and set other custom options.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa_5:_Hasha_no_Sh%C5%8Dg%C5%8D_Campione", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28793\n"}
