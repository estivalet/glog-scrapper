{"name": "Oekaki Logic 2", "overview": "Oekaki Logic 2 (\"Picture Logic 2\") is a puzzle game of the picross/nonogram variant, where players create an image using a set of number guides that tell them where to mark a grid to form the desired picture. The game was the second to be released by Sekai Bunka Publishing on the Super Famicom via the digital cart-writing \"Nintendo Power\" service around the same time Nintendo themselves were putting out their service-exclusive Picross NP series. Like the first Oekaki Logic, the player can choose to play through the puzzles in one of two modes, or go back and complete all puzzles in both modes. The first mode penalizes the player for mistakes, correcting them in the process, but will only do this a certain number of times before the player must start the puzzle over. The second mode neither penalizes nor corrects the player's mistakes, letting them potentially ruin their chances of solving the puzzle by giving them an infinite amount of room for error. Instead of two bears, the two modes are represented by a crocodile (mode 1) and a beige cat (mode 2).", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1999", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marigul", "publishers": "Sekai Bunka", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73742\n"}
