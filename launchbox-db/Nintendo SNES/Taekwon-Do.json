{"name": "Taekwon-Do", "overview": "Taekwon-Do is based on the real life martial art taekwondo, using its real attacks and tournament rules. Each character (there are 19) has his own specialties and the player can create their own personalized fighter (selecting their abilities, aspect, precedence, etc...). Controlling a fighter is done by inputting controls for attacks, with the different attacks being toggled just by pressing a direction on the controller and a button (forward + B for example). There are four game modes: Tournament, V.S, Tag battle by turns, and Practice. This game offers a language selection for either Japanese or Korean.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Human Entertainment", "publishers": "Human Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4yMFWoL06w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72458\n"}
