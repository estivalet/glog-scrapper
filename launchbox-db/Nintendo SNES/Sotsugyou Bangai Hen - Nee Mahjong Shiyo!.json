{"name": "Sotsugyou Bangai Hen: Nee Mahjong Shiyo!", "overview": "Sotsugyou Bangai Hen: Nee Mahjong Shiyo! (\"Graduation Extra-Story: Hey, Mahjong Present!\") is a mahjong game for the Super Famicom. It features a cast of highschool seniors from an all-girls school and their male homeroom teacher, who decide to play mahjong against each other. Despite the format, the game is not ecchi (adult) in nature. The game is based on the Graduation (Sotsugyou) series of school simulation games. Many of those games featured the same cast, and the player (as their teacher) had to mold them into model students by tutoring them on their weak subjects. This game is designated as \"bangai hen\", which means \"extra story\" or \"bonus story\" - a game not part of the core series, but related.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Headroom", "publishers": "KSS", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89638\n"}
