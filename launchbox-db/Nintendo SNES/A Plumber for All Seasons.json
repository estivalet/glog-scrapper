The premise is that each world represents a different season \u2014 there's a Spring world, a Summer world, a Fall world, and a Winter world (And some more!). What might set it apart from other hacks is that a lot of resources are made by the author - all the graphics, a bit of ASM, and even some music here and there. A Plumber For All Seasons features: \u2022 37 levels with 41 exits. \u2022 Almost entirely custom graphics, all of them hand-made. \u2022 A focus on interesting, season-themed scenery and fun levels. \u2022 An original soundtrack by some of SMWC's finest musicians. \u2022 Rewards and easter eggs for completionists.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 4, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "WhiteYoshiEgg", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpI9N6TzpM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153070\n"}
