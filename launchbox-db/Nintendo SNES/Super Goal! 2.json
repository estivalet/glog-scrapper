{"name": "Super Goal! 2", "overview": "Welcome to the world's most popular sport with the kind of detail and realism that only Jaleco can deliver. In Super Goal! 2 you'll be able to control a whole soccer team - from selecting a stadium and formation, right down to making a spectacular bicycle kick with 10 seconds on the clock. Choose a team that you can take all the way to the finish and you'll win the Super Cup - the international soccer championship. But along the way you'll come to know your team inside out. Know where to put your players, know which formations to use against which opponents, and, most of all, get comfortable with all of a soccer player's moves: headers, steals, checks, sliding tackles, and more.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5880\n"}
