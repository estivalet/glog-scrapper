{"name": "Super Mario World: The Second Reality Project 2: Zycloboo's Challenge", "overview": "Storyline: A One-Eyed Big Boo called Zycloboo wants to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, and like Bowser in \"The Second Reality Project Reloaded\" he wants to use the power source from another dimension called the Second Reality to get to his goal. To get Mario out of sight (or maybe for some other reasons?) he warps Mario and his castle into the Second Reality. Mario's only chance to stop Zycloboo is to activate the Power Switch again, which he disabled himself during his last adventure in this strange dimension to avoid misuse of it's power. But to stop Zycloboo, he must be able to return to the Mushroom Kingdom and for that he needs the gateways active, since they are Mario's only chance to return - well, that is the plan at least, heeheehee! About the game: The levels for itself are most of the time very \"big\" compared to the typical SMW-level. Going by length, they have more from a Yoshi's Island-level. You can find a lot of hidden stuff here and there, dozens of bonus rooms and so on. There are also a few levels where you can go different roads. Sometimes, the second route is more hidden and harder to beat, but it will lead to a secret exit. There is much to explore. ;)", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 24, 2014", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FPI", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130336\n"}
