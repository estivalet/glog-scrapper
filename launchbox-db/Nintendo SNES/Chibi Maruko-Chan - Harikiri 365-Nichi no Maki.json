{"name": "Chibi Maruko-Chan: Harikiri 365-Nichi no Maki", "overview": "Chibi Maruko-Chan: Harikiri 365-Nichi no Maki (\"Chibi Maruko's Volume of 365 Days\") is a virtual board game adaptation of the Chibi Maruko-Chan \"slice of life\" manga. The goal is to move along a board of 28-31 spaces that represent a month, finding helpful items and either gaining or losing money depending on what is found after each roll. The first player to pass the finish line gets a 100 yen bonus, but players that keep rolling low numbers might find themselves with more money in the long run if they're particularly fortunate. Games can be set from 1 month up to an entire 12 months, with the eventual winner decided by the total amount of money earned.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 13, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SAS Sakata", "publishers": "Epoch", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48708\n"}
