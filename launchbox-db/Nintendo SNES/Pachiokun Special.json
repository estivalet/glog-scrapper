{"name": "Pachiokun Special", "overview": "Pachiokun Special is the first Super Famicom entry into Coconuts Japan's Pachiokun franchise, starring the eponymous sentient pachinko ball. As with earlier games in the series, there is a single-player adventure mode that acts as a framing device for the game's many pachinko tables. Each pachinko table has its own \"personality\" regarding the preferable amount of power when firing the pachinko balls and the likely payouts. There would eventually be two more Pachiokun Special games: Pachiokun Special 2 and Pachiokun Special 3. \"Special\" simply signifies that these are the Super Famicom entries in the series.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 11, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marionette Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Coconuts Japan Entertainment Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88590\n"}
