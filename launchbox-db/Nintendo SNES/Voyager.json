{"name": "Voyager", "overview": "Voyager is a fast paced, intermediate Kaizo hack with some puzzle elements and a light narrative. It is overall mostly vanilla but includes some chocolate mechanics. It aims to be somewhat of a challenge for all Kaizo skillsets (beginners be warned), but overall it aims to be fun. It includes brand new custom graphics, but I tried to keep them as similar to the original SMW style as possible. There is a light story to add some theming and atmosphere, but its not a major focus, just there for people who enjoy that sort of thing. Also includes: - 8 secret portrait rooms - Custom Music - Music-free file - Checkpoint saves - Fast Retry - Standard quality of life patches What to expect: - Modern, fast paced gameplay - A balance of standard platforming and tricks - Some puzzly set-ups - No Kaizo blocks - No bosses - Semi open world - Trolls - Music that compliments the atmosphere of the level rather than non-stop \"bangers\" (sorry) Thanks for playing, good luck, and ENJOY!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 5, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parahax", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158800\n"}
