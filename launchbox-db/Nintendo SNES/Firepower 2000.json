{"name": "Firepower 2000", "overview": "Imagine if all the mega weapons in the world fell into the wrong hands. And then were turned against you. That's the time for major firepower. You've got to take the wheel of a jumping, whirling, gun-heavy jeep that fires in any direction. Or master the controls of a deadly fast, missile-loaded helicopter. Both war machines have special capabilities. Both change into different vehicles on certain levels. It's up to you to pick the right weapon. So get ready to collect your flamethrowers, plasma cannons, lasers, guided missiles, nuclear weapons and more. There's no time to assemble forces -- it's just you or you and a partner going straight into the blazing, blasting heart of enemy territory. Make sure you buckle up. And put your finger on firepower.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 13, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Sales Curve", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.52", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3445\n"}
