{"name": "Fortune Quest: Dice wo Korogase", "overview": "Based on the anime OVA Fortune Quest: a parody of D&D fantasy games about a group of six broke adventurers who take a simple quest for funds which ends up getting far more complicated and dangerous than they were anticipating. The game is structurally similar to Asmik's Dokapon franchise: as characters move around the board, the squares they land on occasionally take them to different events, including fights with monsters (which are janken battles, rather than actual combat). The characters can earn money and leave traps for other opponents, and are required to save a group of villages in order to win the game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Zamuse", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73215\n"}
