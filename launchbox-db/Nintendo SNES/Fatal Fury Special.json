{"name": "Fatal Fury Special", "overview": "An update to the second installment of the Fatal Fury series (similar to the Street Fighter II updates), Fatal Fury Special improves the game speed, makes it easier to combo attacks together, updates the background stages, makes the four boss characters playable, and adds three new playable characters from the original Fatal Fury: Duck King, Tung Fu Rue, and Geese Howard. It also adds a new hidden crossover boss (Ryo Sakazaki from the Art of Fighting series). The version released in Europe differs from the Japanese and the US release in that Ryo Sakazaki is selectable from the start and has 4 fewer fighters due to the fact that it was released in a cartridge of only 24 megabits compared to the original 32 of the full port.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Monolith Corp.", "publishers": "TAKARA Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_Special", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAsUVT9Z5zY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2705\n"}
