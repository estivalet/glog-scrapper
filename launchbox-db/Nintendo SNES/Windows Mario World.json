{"name": "Windows Mario World", "overview": "Windows Mario World is my first SMW hack (that I didn't cancel right away.) It will eventually feature every Microsoft operating system. Right now, it only includes the main ones (95, Vista, etc.) The hack has no story planned... it's basically just Mario in a few operating systems (at this point.) I tested this on ZSNES, BSNES, SNES9x, SNEmulDS, and a random Android SNES emulator, and it worked the same on all of them.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 9, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BetaMaster64", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2tkA0vlnns", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114837\n"}
