{"name": "Super Naxat Open: Golf de Shoubu da Dorabocchan", "overview": "The spiritual successor to Naxat Open, a golf game that Naxat published and lent their name to. The game uses the standard top-down perspective for golf games from this era. It is unusual for the inclusion of Naxat's Dorabocchan (\"Little Dorabo\") character, who had appeared in two games at this point: 1990's Makai Prince Dorabocchan for the PC Engine and 1993's Chou Makai Taisen: Dorabocchan for SNES, best known as The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang in the US. Dorabocchan/Spike's inherent magical talent allows him to beneficially manipulate his game, which appears in the form of magical cards he can play before taking a swing. The player can also choose to play as five other characters from the franchise, as well as a choice of six caddies.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kuusou Kagaku", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-Uy5Zps1rg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82369\n"}
