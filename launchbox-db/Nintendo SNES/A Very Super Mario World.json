{"name": "A Very Super Mario World", "overview": "A Very Super Mario World is a ROM Hack for the SNES, released in 2015 by SchwerMuta. There are eight primary worlds, an extra world, a star world that connects various places, and a special, secret world that will test your mettle (and patience.) The goal of every level is to reach the end, and possibly fight a boss such as a koopaling once you do. Many levels have secret exits that are usually opened by taking a key to a keyhole, as per usual Super Mario World fare. There\u2019s many features and gimmicks to many levels, but the feeling of classic Mario platforming typically stays the same. The story is always the same; Mario goes on an adventure to save his friends and the Princess from the evil King Bowser, and along the way, jumps, shoots and even flies through the land in search of the castles controlled by Bowser\u2019s underlings.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 4, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SchwerMuta", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150720\n"}
