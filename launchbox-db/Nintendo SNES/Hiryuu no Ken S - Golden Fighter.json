{"name": "Hiryuu no Ken S: Golden Fighter", "overview": "Hiryuu no Ken S: Golden Fighter was the original version of the game released in Japan in 1992. It was quickly discontinued and replaced by a slightly improved version titled Hiryuu no Ken S: Hyper Version, which was released four months later. Hyper Version differs from Golden Fighter by increasing the playing speed and adding more options. The American version, which was released in 1993 and was titled Ultimate Fighter (likely to cash-in on the yearly Ultimate Fighting Championship event that started the same year), carries over the improvements from Hyper Version while adding further changes of its own, essentially serving as a third version of the game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 31, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Culture Brain", "publishers": "Culture Brain", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112193\n"}
