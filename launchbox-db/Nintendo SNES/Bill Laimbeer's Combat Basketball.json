{"name": "Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball", "overview": "The game predicts a science-fiction version of the year 2030 in which there are only robot basketball players (excluding Bill Laimbeer). Basketball teams play in gruelling league matches where new players are bought and sold. Within this future, basketball uses a dedicated robot to perform the toss up at the start of each match as referees had been fired by Bill Laimbeer sometime prior to the year 2030. As a result, players now wear armor to their games and weapons are thrown from the audience.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Laimbeer's_Combat_Basketball", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1646\n"}
