{"name": "The Lost Vikings", "overview": "It's just another cool day of Nordic seafaring and pillaging when Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce and Olaf the Stout are suddenly sucked into an alien spaceship. And only you can help them find their way home. But each mysterious door you help them through throws them into different eras in time - and smack into new enemies! Will Baleog conquer Elmo the Dinosaur in Prehistoria? Will Olaf shield himself from the berserker mummies in the Great Pyramids of Egypt? And can Erik outrun the maniacal ripsaw in the Great Factory? Hurry! Only you can get these vanished Vikes out of the grasp of their alien captors and home through the chaotic arcade action!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silicon & Synapse", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItppVpUwwc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3056\n"}
