Yeti the abominable snowbeast is about to put a chill on the entire planet - It's up to you to put the freeze on this cold-hearted creature. Grab your acorn stash and embark on a puzzling adventure through the freaky forest, a maze-filled volcano, a zany street carnival... and use your mighty tail to stomp purple plum-heads, squirrel-eating slugs and bumbling bees... Only you, Mr. Nutz, can save the planet from becoming a giant ice cube. Happy tails to you!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.18", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9bI4oIT5e4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5350\n"}
