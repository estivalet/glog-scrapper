{"name": "Lethal Enforcers", "overview": "Lethal Enforcers is out to clean up the streets in the baddest parts of Chicago. Digitized graphics and sound will slam you into cold reality and heated action. Your job is to defend the innocent and protect yourself from a fatal case of lead poisoning. Your side iron is packed inside and ready to blow you away with a true arcade experience. Just like the arcade game, you've got the quick reload feature. Time it just right so you don't run out of ammo while you're trading bullets with the scum of the earth. Upgrade your firepower along the way to magnum, 12-round automatic, assault rifle, shot gun, machine gun or grenade gun. Your type of street cleaning takes place where the dirtiest deeds go down. But first, a training level lets you take target practice and take out your frustrations, then on to reality. Be on the lookout for bank job in progress, high speed chase, ninjas downtown, hijacking at the international airport, gunrunners at the shipping dock, helicopter chase, chemical plant sabotage with volatile Heat of the Night Vision. The pressure under fire is so intense you'll be sweating bullets. Start shooting in any stage you select. At the end of each level, you'll get your hit percentage and your performance rank, from patrolman to commander.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 3, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3625\n"}
