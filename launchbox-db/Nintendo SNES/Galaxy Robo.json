{"name": "Galaxy Robo", "overview": "Galaxy Robo is a sci-fi strategy game from Copya System and Imagineer. The player directs a group of mech pilots, each riding distinctive bi-pedal suits and other vehicles. The game is structurally similar to Fire Emblem: the player moves all their units for their turn, either fighting enemy units or performing other tasks, and then control switches to the opponent. When two units meet in combat, a cutaway cutscene shows the aggressor landing (or missing) a hit, and the unit statistics underneath tell the player how much damage was caused. The game was a Japanese exclusive. It was one of a handful of games to use the SNES Mouse peripheral.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Copya System", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57706\n"}
