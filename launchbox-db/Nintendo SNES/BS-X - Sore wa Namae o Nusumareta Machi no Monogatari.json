{"name": "BS-X: Sore wa Namae o Nusumareta Machi no Monogatari", "overview": "The game aspects of BS-X are debatable. The title functions more as the interface for the Satellaview than it does as a game in its own right. After players select a name and gender for their avatar, they may explore Sore wa Namae o Nusumareta Machi - a small town consisting of 20 buildings, a telephone booth, a field, a pier, a train track, a talking tree, and a beach. From several of these locations the player is given the option of downloading game data, downloadable games, or downloadable magazines. A copy of BS-X was bundled with every Satellaview that was sold and for users of the Satellaview, the game was required to use any of the Satellaview's features.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 23, 1995", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77050\n"}
