{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Proto", "overview": "This prototype is an is an interpretation of various development phases of the game based on the Alttp prototype assets. This is not an authentic prototype nor does it represent a single or specific point of development. This is a result of 4 months (maybe 5) of \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d hard work, a few assembly hacks and fixes etc. This game was known as A Link To The Past and only has been renamed into A Link To The Proto for the release to stand on it\u2019s own. There is a lot of changes, prototype assets that made it into the game, but unfortunately due to the multiple iterations of the same tilesets and a rather limited space for graphics, only a few select ones made it into the reconstruction. But still, there is a lot of places to explore and many unseen things to discover from the proto content that was cut from the final vanilla game by Nintendo.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 2, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SePH", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147443\n"}
