{"name": "Mahjong Hishouden: Shin Naki no Ryuu", "overview": "A mahjong game based on a manga and anime OVA that concerns a quiet but intense young man known only as Ryuu (Dragon) who frequently hustles Yakuza thugs in mahjong matches. The manga license had been adapted for a video game twice before, most recently with the 1992 Super Famicom game Naki no Ryuu: Mahjong Hishouden. As with its predecessor, the player can follow a story mode with set opponents, or they can select from a group of characters for a one-off game. To win, the player must have the most points after a fixed number of rounds.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Unknown", "publishers": "BEC Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87582\n"}
