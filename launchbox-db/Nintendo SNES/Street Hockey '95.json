{"name": "Street Hockey '95", "overview": "It's Inline Anarchy! Street Hockey '95 takes inline sports to a totally new level with 24 megs of digitized graphics and sounds to pull you into the action. Get enough air to show up on radar. Nail that unblockable slap shot, top-shelf, in the corner. Or combine a knee-stop with a no-look pass, if you can hang. With six obstacle-covered asphalt arenas, the scenery's as fresh as the moves. Plug in a four-player adapter (optional), and you and three friends can take on each other-and gravity-in the most extreme aerial adventure ever to hit the small screen.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GTE Entertainment", "publishers": "GTE Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Hockey_%2795", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzY6y2lnecs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5864\n"}
