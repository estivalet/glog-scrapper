{"name": "Lemmings", "overview": "Thousands of Lemmings are on the loose, marching towards extinction unless you can save them. Without minds of their own, they are completely helpless, faithfully following their leader through 125 levels of blazing fires, endless canyons, deadly tunnels and ancient ruins. One thing's for sure: their future lies in your hands, because beyond every obstacle awaits certain disaster. Lose one Lemming and you risk losing them all! You or you and a friend can command the Lemmings to dig, climb, tunnel, float and build their way to safety. But you have to move fast, because each moment you hesitate, more Lemmings may drop from above! So you better be good. The farther you get, the faster the Lemmings hurtle towards their demise. One wrong move and you could wipe out an entire species!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 18, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9QHM_aASrA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2679\n"}
