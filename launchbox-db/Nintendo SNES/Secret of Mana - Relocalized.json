{"name": "Secret of Mana: Relocalized", "overview": "Secret of Mana -Relocalized- is an attempt to relocalize, update, and uncensor Secret of Mana. This patch is an addendum to FuSoYa\u2019s Variable Width Font Edition of the game. The decision to use FuSoYa\u2019s VWF as a base for my own was made early on for a couple of reasons. Primarily, because FuSoYa\u2019s VWF hack is the only English VWF hack in town and secondly, because it is well regarded as a classic and is considered by many to be the definitive version of the game in English. This hack updates almost anything with a name on it. Including characters, weapons, spells, elementals, armor, items, towns, monsters, bosses. It also removes all of the game\u2019s religious censorship in both the game\u2019s naming assets and the script. There are a few typos and some other minor script elements that are modified here and there as well.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 17, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Timbo", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111834\n"}
