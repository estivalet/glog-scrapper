{"name": "Pop'n TwinBee", "overview": "Pop'n TwinBee (\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30f3\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc) is a top-down, shoot 'em up originally released in 1993 by Konami for the Super Famicom in Japan and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the PAL region. The sixth game in the TwinBee series, it's a direct follow-up to the arcade hit, Detana!! TwinBee (Bells & Whistles). The PAL version was published by Konami's Palcom Software division and was the first of three TwinBee games localized for the European market, followed by a Game Boy version of Pop'n TwinBee and the side-scrolling platformer, Pop'n TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventures. Like the arcade game, up to two players can play simultaneously with the objective being to maneuver through a series of seven stages, facing a boss at the end of each. Unlike the previous game, instead of extra lives, the player has a life meter that determines how much damage the player's ship can take before losing.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2092\n"}
