{"name": "Super Fire Pro Wrestling 2", "overview": "Super Fire Pro Wrestling 2 is the second Super Famicom game in Human's long-running wrestling series, and the sixth overall. It directly follows 1991's Super Fire Pro Wrestling. As with other games in the series, Super Fire Pro Wrestling 2 is notable for its deeply technical mechanics and timing-based grappling moves as well as featuring many wrestlers from across the world with assumed names, as Fire Pro Wrestling never acquired the licenses necessary to use their real names. Various Japanese wrestlers (Puroresu), WWE stars and Lucha Libre wrestlers make up the roster of playable characters.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 25, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Human Entertainment", "publishers": "Human Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28946\n"}
