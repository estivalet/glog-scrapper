{"name": "J.League Excite Stage '96", "overview": "The third of A-Max's Excite Stage games to be released on the Super Famicom, and also the last. However, the series would persist on the Nintendo Game Boy Color and Sony PlayStation. The game focuses on the 1996 season of the J-League with its sixteen teams, with options to recreate the league or play exhibition matches or tournaments with any of the sixteen. Like its predecessors, the game uses a horizontal perspective of the pitch that is slightly angled to make it easier to determine the distance between players. It creates this effect through the Super Famicom's Mode 7 scaling technology.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "A-Max", "publishers": "Epoch", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAEfYba5BM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73651\n"}
