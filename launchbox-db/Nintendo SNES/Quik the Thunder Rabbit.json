{"name": "Quik the Thunder Rabbit", "overview": "Quik the Thunder Rabbit is a platforming game that was part of the early 90s glut of \"fast animal\" platformers, aka Sonic The Hedgehog clones. The SNES version of Quik the Thunder Rabbit was previously unknown until \"TheRealPhoenix\" posted the ROM image on the Assembler Games forum. This prototype is clearly not close to competition. It lacks music, and only the first couple of levels appear to be complete. If you press \"R\", you can skip ahead to the next level. The levels in the prototype do not correspond to anything in the Amiga game, so this game was probably a sequel. As such, we cannot assume that \"Quik the Thunder Rabbit\" is what the final game would have been called. The game engine itself seems pretty much finished, at least for the platforming levels. In the Assembler Games thread, user pichichi010 states that the developer Stywox went bankrupt, which seems like a pretty reasonable guess as to why this game was never finished.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stywox", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126616\n"}
