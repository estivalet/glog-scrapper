{"name": "Mick & Mack as the Global Gladiators", "overview": "Mick & Mack was a McDonald's licensed game developed by David Perry at Virgin Games. It appeared on various Sega systems and the Amiga, though they cancelled the SNES version. It is a platform shooter game with an environmental theme. The game was shown at the Winter 1993 CES, apparently after the Genesis version was already out. If one was to venture a guess, it probably wasn't completed because it would have come out too long after the Genesis version, and possibly too close to the release of Cool Spot. The in-game copyright screen says 1993, so it was almost certainly in development after the Genesis version was already released.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virgin Games", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92867\n"}
