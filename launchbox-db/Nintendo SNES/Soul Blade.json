{"name": "Soul Blade", "overview": "Soul Blade is a pirated port of the PlayStation game of the same name, made for the SNES and Sega Mega Drive by an unknown developer in 1997. The controls are considered bad, as there is a delay when attacking your opponent. The fighting engines are recycled from Tekken 2 and Tekken Special. The final boss in the SNES version is Li Long with a very messy color palette, the Mega Drive version only has Cerevantes and Shadow Cerevantes (Who is most likely Soul Edge, especially Li Long in the SNES version.)", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gamtec Co.
