{"name": "Ultra Seven", "overview": "Ultra Seven has a gameplay similar to most fighting games released at the time. You are Ultra Seven, an alien from Planet M-78, and have to defeat some enemies of the television series, like Pitt, Eleking and Gutts. You have three energy bars to watch. The first (left side of screen) shows your energy. If you reach the end, you are defeated. The second (in the center of the screen) shows your powers and has four power levels: L1, L2, L3, L4. The third bar is the energy of your opponent. When you defeat your enemy, you will get a warning of 'finish', and it is better that this bar is in L4, the only way you can defeat your enemies", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BEC Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Bandai Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81739\n"}
