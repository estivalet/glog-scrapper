{"name": "F-ZERO: FSNES3 Edition", "overview": "Imagine a typical car race track \u2013 something you\u2019d see in any grand prix or even stock car race. Take that track and hang it high in the air over, say\u2026 a barren desert planet, a tropical paradise, or even populated cities like New York or Chicago. Now, put the cars on the track\u2026 but replace the usual designs with extravagant, sleek, super-aerodynamic styles. Also, get rid of those old gasoline engines and worn-out rubber wheels\u2026 and replace them with souped-up jet engines, powerful turbines, and anti-gravity devices for smooth, friction-less motion. Finally, bring it all together and make those super-fast machines of the future fly along those suspended tracks at speeds like you\u2019ve never seen, dodging the other cars and environmental hazards like bombs and magnets threatening to pull the machine into the powered guard rails or even off the very tracks themselves! This hack caters to a specific kind of player, I think. If you are looking for a rock-hard challenge, this hack delivers. The tracks range from very tricky to downright brutal. If you are looking for something more laid back and \u201cfor-fun\u201d, this may not be the right choice for you.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128441\n"}
