{"name": "Knights of the Round", "overview": "Legend says that the man who pulls the sword, Excalibur, from the stone is destined to be king. But even the power of Excalibur can not release Britain from the chaos into which it has plunged. Years of civil war have taken their toll and now only the power of the legendary grail can bring peace back to the land. Join Arthur, Lancelot and Percival as they begin their quest for the magic grail. Do battle with evil knights, petty tyrants and sinister sorcerers as you fight through the darkest trials that evil can muster. Defeat them all to reclaim the grail and you may assume your rightful place as a Knight of the Round!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_the_Round_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyLUgTOVteo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1279\n"}
