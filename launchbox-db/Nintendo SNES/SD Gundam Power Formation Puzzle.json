{"name": "SD Gundam Power Formation Puzzle", "overview": "Puzzle game that involves stacking colored blocks in rows across the bottom of the screen. When four blocks of the same color are adjacent to each other, though not necessarily in a straight horizontal or vertical line, they are destroyed and disappear. Placing four differently-colored blocks in a row will also cause them disappear. Unlike most puzzle games of this type, the goal is not to remove blocks from the player's side of the screen, but to keep as many active at once. By piling up full rows, the player can then destroy several rows at once to create a mech which can be sent over to the opponent's side to damage their mothership. The more full rows the player eliminates in one move, the stronger the resulting mech. Opponents can also create mechs as well, and when two mechs meet in combat the stronger one wins but levels down by the strength level of their opponent. So a level 3 mech fighting a level 2 mech will cause the level 2 mech to be destroyed, but also drops the level 3 mech to level 1. The player can also use special moves, either offensive or defensive, based on collecting special \"P\" blocks. These also need to be stacked together in a group of four before the player can reap their benefits, but they stick around as helpful junk blocks after their power has been taken.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tom Create", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26613\n"}
