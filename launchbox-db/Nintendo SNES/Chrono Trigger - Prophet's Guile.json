{"name": "Chrono Trigger: Prophet's Guile", "overview": "This is one awesome ROM hack of Chrono Trigger made by the same team responsible for Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes. It displays some advanced concepts in the CT ROM hacking community, such as custom music tracks (some are modified from the original game and some are plucked from Final Fantasy 6). The game follows the story of what happened to Magus after his defeat to the Chrono team in the middle ages. He's back to Zeal and plays the role of \"prophet\" as he tries to undo the day when his reality was destroyed by Lavos.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kajar Laboratories", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79662\n"}
