{"name": "Super Metroid: Tallon IV Tours: Chozo Ruins Rumble", "overview": "Get ready to rumble... Starting with the elevator room at the Ruin's entrance and extending through to the Sunchamber, this is a map of Metroid Prime's Chozo Ruins, in SNEStroid 2D. It is somewhat condensed compared to the GCN game- all the boring tunnels are gone, and save rooms have merged into the rooms they were connected to. Other \"main\" rooms have been combined as well, when I felt it appropriate. The route diverges slightly as a result, early in the game. I hope you enjoy your stay on Tallon IV!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 30, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "dewhi100", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6KePnQgxs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163797\n"}
