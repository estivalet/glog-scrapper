{"name": "Sanrio Shanghai", "overview": "Sanrio Shanghai is a mahjong solitaire licensed game that uses the world of Sanrio characters, such as Hello Kitty, KeroKeroKeroppi and others, for the various tiles that the player must remove. The game features a few modes: a single-player, and two competitive two-player modes. One of these multiplayer modes involves alternating turns, while the other has each player solve as much of the grid as possible within a time limit before switching over. As with most Sanrio licensed games, Sanrio Shanghai is intended for younger audiences, with its simple difficulty and big, colorful tiles. It was only released on the Super Famicom and never saw an English localization.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 31, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SAS Sakata", "publishers": "Character Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82545\n"}
