{"name": "Hatayama Hacchi no Pro Yakyuu News! Jitsumeiban", "overview": "Hatayama Hacchi no Pro Yakyuu News! Jitsumeiban is a baseball game with a comedic cartoonish theme. The title roughly translates as \"Pro Baseball News by Hatayama Hacchi! Real Name Version\" (the \"Real Name Version\" refers to the game's license to use actual athlete/team names from the Nippon Professional Baseball league). It looks and plays like Namco's Famista/Family Stadium series. Like many Epoch games released around this time, the game is compatible with the Barcode Battler. Players can scan barcodes through the device, which can be read by the Super Famicom via a peripheral sold separately. These unlock additional athletes for use.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 29, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Agenda", "publishers": "Epoch Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73461\n"}
