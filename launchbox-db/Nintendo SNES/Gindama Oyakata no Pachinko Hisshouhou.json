{"name": "Gindama Oyakata no Pachinko Hisshouhou", "overview": "Gindama Oyakata no Jissen Pachinko Hisshouhou (\"Silver Ball Master's Surefire Hit Combat Pachinko\") is a pachinko simulator for the Super Famicom, and part of the lengthy Jissden Pachinko Hisshouhou series. It features multiple pachinko tables, some of which are based on those manufactured by game publishers Sammy Corporation while others are credited to Heiwa and Sankyo: fellow manufacturers of actual pachinko machines. The game features a number of modes, including a tutorial mode that reveals how best to play the virtual tables and their real-life equivalents - often a draw for fans of the real thing in simulators such as this - and a story mode where a living pachinko ball tries to win a fortune, similar to the premise of Coconuts Japan's Pachio-kun series.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 17, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sammy Corporation", "publishers": "Sammy Corporation", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87448\n"}
