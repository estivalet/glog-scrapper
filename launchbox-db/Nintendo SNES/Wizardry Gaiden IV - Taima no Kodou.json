{"name": "Wizardry Gaiden IV: Taima no Kodou", "overview": "Wizardry Gaiden IV: Taima no Kodou (\"Throb of the Demon's Heart\") is a turn-based dungeon crawler RPG for the Super Famicom. It is the fourth in a series of \"gaiden\" Wizardry games developed by Japanese studio Access and influenced heavily by Sir-Tech's core Wizardry series. The game was fan translated in late 2016. Throb of the Demon's Heart is distinctive for the Wizardry series for adapting a lot of Japanese imagery and monsters in the familiar Wizardry format. This gives it a more home-grown feel among the Japanese-exclusive spin-offs, and heavily draws from Japanese folklore and religion. It is the first Wizardry Gaiden to be released on a system other than the Nintendo Game Boy, and is also the last in the series. Many more Japanese Wizardry spin-off games would follow, however.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Access", "publishers": "Ascii Entertainment", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33125\n"}
