{"name": "Bass Masters Classic", "overview": "Welcome Anglers! Welcome to the BASS Masters Classic. My name is Hank. Think of me as your unofficial host. I'll tell you what you need to know. This tour consists of four 3-day tournaments at four lakes. The first one is at Skull Lake. You'll see my bait shop there and get to know your way around the dock area, but first you'll need to take care of a few things. Check your gear because you're out to get the Big One. This is it, the World Championship! Good luck!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Black Pearl Software", "publishers": "Malibu Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3308\n"}
