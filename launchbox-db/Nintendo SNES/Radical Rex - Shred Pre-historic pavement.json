{"name": "Radical Rex: Shred Pre-historic pavement", "overview": "Come hang with Radical Rex. He's the raddest, baddest fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus ever to shred prehistoric pavement! This badboy-on-wheels is out to save the dinosaur race. Check Rex thrashin' on his board, sportin' his flame-breath, bustin' out with killer jump-kicks, swingin' on vines and blastin' out screen-shaking roars. Excellent! Slam through ten wild levels of jammin' jungles, freaked-out forests, haunted dino-graveyards, piranha-infested underwater caverns -- and inside a giant dinosaur! Rex keeps you groovin' while you keep him movin' past twenty of the meanest prehistoric nasties to rock his dino-world. No sweat for Rex -- 'cuz he's too hip to be extinct!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5531\n"}
