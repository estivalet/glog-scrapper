{"name": "Super Alfred Chicken", "overview": "Super Alfred Chicken is a side-scrolling platformer. The evil Meca Chickens want to produce a super army by cloning Alfred's friends. Of course Alfred has to stop them now. The gameplay follows the genre standards: Alfred walks through the 21 levels and needs to avoid enemies/obstacles by jumping over them. Every contact with enemies is deadly except when using Alfred's dive bomb attack. Occasionally there are simple switch puzzles to solve, mostly in order to find secret rooms with goodies. Examples for power-ups are hidden watering cans (collecting all unlocks a different ending), additional time, temporary invincibility or diamonds (100 reward an extra life). Balloons on the way act as restarting points after death. In some instances, the level ends with a boss fight", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Twilight", "publishers": "Mindscape International Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3554\n"}
