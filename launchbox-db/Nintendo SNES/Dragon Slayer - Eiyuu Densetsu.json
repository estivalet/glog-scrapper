{"name": "Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu", "overview": "Unlike the previous Dragon Slayer games, which were all side-scrolling action RPGs, The Legend of Heroes is a far more straightforward turn-based RPG of the Dragon Quest mold. It allowed for a party of up to four characters and had a few modern upgrades, such as allowing the player to distribute stats after a level up, target separate monsters and restart a battle if their party gets wiped out. It received one direct sequel, Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II, before the series would drop the Dragon Slayer prefix and continue as a separate Falcom property.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 14, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Epoch", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Slayer:_The_Legend_of_Heroes", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26600\n"}
