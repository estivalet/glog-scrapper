{"name": "Zan II Spirits", "overview": "A war simulator set in the Sengoku era of Japanese history. The first Super Famicom game in Wolf Team's series of strategy sims set in historical Japan. It was eventually followed up with a sequel, Zan III: Spirits. As with its thematically-similar contemporaries, like Shingen the Ruler or Nobunaga's Ambition, Zan II puts the player in the geta of a Japanese feudal lord, or daimyo, with designs to wrest control over the rest of Japan from the other daimyos. The game is more focused on warfare than day-to-day resource management, with armies of samurai marching across the map to attack fortresses and pagodas that host enemy flags.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 29, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86052\n"}
