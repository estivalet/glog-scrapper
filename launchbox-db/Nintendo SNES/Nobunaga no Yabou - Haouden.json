{"name": "Nobunaga no Yabou: Haouden", "overview": "Nobunaga no Yabou: Haouden (\"Nobunaga's Ambition: Tale of the Conquerer\") is a strategy-sim from Koei and the fifth in their flagship Nobunaga's Ambition series of Sengoku-era feudal sims. Once again, the player assumes one of a number of daimyos, including Oda Nobunaga himself, and tries to take over the rest of Japan. It was originally released in 1992 for the PC-9801 home computer and ported to various other computers and consoles of the period. Among the tweaks to the gameplay was the addition of castles, which are now the locations that players must conquer in order to take over new territory. Haouden was also the first game in the series to be given an expansion pack, though this pack would not be available to all versions of the game. The game was the first flagship Nobunaga's Ambition game to never receive a US localization. It sits between the fourth game, Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness (Nobunaga no Yabou: Bushou Fuuunroku) from 1990, and the sixth game, Nobunaga no Yabou: Tenshouki from 1994.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 9, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KOEI Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Koei Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87928\n"}
