{"name": "Earthbound: Arn's Winter Quest", "overview": "Arn's Winter Quest is Toby Fox's first romhack of EarthBound. The hack takes place in winter. It is very lighthearted, having tons of funny dialogue. In the words of its creator, \u201cArn\u2019s Winter Quest has been a labor of love for me for two months, and rivals those hacks such as Hat Quest and EarthBound 2.5: Electric Boogaloo Joint Jive. It has a lot of fun inside jokes, an incoherent story, and all new battle graphics. This hack is basically linear Dragon Warrior with a bunch of humor thrown in, so if you like fighting and you like funny and you like very hard viewtiful fun time hacks, then don\u2019t play this hack because it\u2019ll satisfy your cravings and your head will probably explode.\u201d There are also lots of bugs. Reset everytime you save in a new place. Actually save. If you die without save-reset, then you\u2019ll end up the first place you saved. If you haven\u2019t saved throughout the game, you\u2019ll be dropped in a death ocean.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 2, 2006", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toby Fox", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KkMN1DSiW8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127479\n"}
