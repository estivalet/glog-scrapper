{"name": "Waterworld (2021 ROM Hack)", "overview": "The floodgate has been opened! \"The future, where polar ice caps have melted, covering our land with water. Those who survived have adapted to a new world.\" Waterworld's philosophy is \"what if water levels were good?\" The levels of this game were designed around interesting setups combined with water. Forget those moments where you were swimming around in a muncher maze. During your dive course you will experience mostly vanilla levels but you will find choco sprinkles on the shores. I make no apologies if you get trolled. Keep that in mind. :) This game features sekruts. For those who loves exploring there is a sekrut ending (+1 exit) with some heavy lore.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 21, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BabaYegha", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158935\n"}
