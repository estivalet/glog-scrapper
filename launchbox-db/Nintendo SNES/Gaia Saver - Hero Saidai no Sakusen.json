{"name": "Gaia Saver: Hero Saidai no Sakusen", "overview": "The Earth is under attack, devastated by terrorist activities conducted by Shocker, invading alien monsters, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, and finally, colony drops conducted by the Principality of Zeon. Earth's military, including the Earth Federation Forces, is powerless to protect the planet. From the Land of Light in Nebula M78, Father of Ultra senses that Earth is in great danger, and sends three Ultra Warriors: Ultraman, Zoffy, and Leo, to save the planet. Earth Federation Forces' main headquarters, Jaburo, was under an all-out attack by Zeon's forces. Thanks to the intervention of the Ultras, however, Amuro Ray, as well as the rest of the White Base crew managed to escape to the SSSP headquarters in Japan. While there, the heroes agree that none of them have the power to save the world by themselves, and agreed to form an \"alliance\" to protect Earth against the enemies that threaten it.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arc System Works", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_Saver", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73200\n"}
