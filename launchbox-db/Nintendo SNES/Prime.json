{"name": "Prime", "overview": "The character, Prime, is pretty much a ripoff of Superman. He has a red cape and a yellow and red outfit. The moves are pretty much what you would expect of a Superman ripoff, with punches, suplexes, throws, kicks and a flying \"Superman\" dive. Manipulating throws is actually pretty easy, which is nice during level 3 where you can throw the enemies off the ledge on the top of the screen. Like most games in the genre, there are only a limited amount of enemies, with pallet swaps being common, and they take far too many hits to kill. Many objects can be picked up and used as weapons, and smashing things in the foreground and background usually produce power-ups.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Malibu Interactive", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.02", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjIWbH82Lho", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72528\n"}
