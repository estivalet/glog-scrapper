{"name": "Mega Man X3: Zero Project", "overview": "A large modification of Mega Man X3 that allows Zero to be fully playable. Among this, there are vast improvements over some aspects of the original game along with a plethora of new features such as a Save/Load system. Also, the game has been modified to be \u2018FastROM\u2019 as well so some slow down has been reduced, but it\u2019s still prevalent throughout the game. This version is considered separate from the original Zero Project since this one has such an entirely rewritten system from the ground up and separate features that people may or may not like compared to the prior version.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 22, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Justin3009", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124706\n"}
