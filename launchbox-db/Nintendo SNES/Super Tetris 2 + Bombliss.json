{"name": "Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss", "overview": "Super Tetris 2: Bombliss (or Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss) is an enhanced Super Famicom port of the original Famicom Tetris 2: Bombliss. The game features five modes spread across two game types: traditional Type A and Type B Tetris and a new Type C mode which raises the block level from the ground upwards as soon as a certain number of pieces have been eliminated. In addition, there are two modes of Bombliss, which is a variant of Tetris that allows the player to create explosions whenever a line is removed that contains at least one bomb segment: Contest and Puzzle. Contest is simply the equivalent of Tetris Type A, while Puzzle creates specific scenarios in which the player has to remove all the lines with a certain number of specific pieces, similar to the Puzzle mode of Tetris 2. The original Super Tetris 2: Bombliss was released around the end of 1992. A slightly updated version of the game, given the subtitle Gentei Han (or \"Limited Edition\"), was released two years later. Neither version was released outside of Japan.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28880\n"}
