{"name": "Brandish", "overview": "Now that you've mastered games like Breath of Fire and Brain Lord, we think you're ready for a role-playing game where the sun doesn't shine and the monsters grow big, really big! In Brandish, you stand accused of murder, being pursued by a fearless bounty hunter looking to collect the reward. About to be captured, you fall into a deep underworld maze filled with dangerous traps and deadly monsters including: giant crabs, headless fist pounding warriors and fire spitting gargoyles. With the bounty hunter still hot on your trail, you must navigate your way out of the mazes and back to the surface ASAP. Our only advice: stay alert, well armed and always moving upwards!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandish_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=QxtmxivtsN0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1653\n"}
