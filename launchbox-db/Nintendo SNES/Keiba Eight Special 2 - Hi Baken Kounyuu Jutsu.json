{"name": "Keiba Eight Special 2: Hi Baken Kounyuu Jutsu", "overview": "Keiba Eight Special 2 is a horseracing game for the Super Famicom and the sequel to 1993's Keiba Eight Special. Like its predecessor, the game is more focused on virtual recreations of hypothetical races that the player customizes ahead of time and then watches play out, then using that \"research\" to predict winners of the actual races. As with Keiba Eight Special, and most horseracing games for the Super Famicom in general, it was never released outside of Japan.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C-Lab", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74451\n"}
