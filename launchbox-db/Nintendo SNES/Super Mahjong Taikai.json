{"name": "Super Mahjong Taikai", "overview": "Super Mahjong Taikai is a follow-up to Mahjong Taikai. The game's structure and gameplay are nearly identical to those of its predecessor. Among the differences is the possibility to select a portrait of the main character (male or female) and a few additional historical characters to compete against: for example, the medieval Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga is now joined by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, famous historical characters of the same era. The roster of modern characters (in particular developers such as Kou Shibusawa) has been expanded as well. Like in the previous game, the grand tournament mode can only be accessed after the player has sufficiently advanced in the ranking.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 12, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KOEI Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Koei Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90001\n"}
