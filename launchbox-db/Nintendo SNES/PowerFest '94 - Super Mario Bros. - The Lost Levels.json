{"name": "PowerFest '94: Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels", "overview": "One of the three Super Nintendo Entertainment System games (Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, Super Mario Kart, and Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball) from Nintendo PowerFest '94, a 1994 Nintendo-promoted video game competition. Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Now available on the Virtual Console in all of its original splendor, Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if thats somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the games secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just dont be surprised if shes in another castle!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D4", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_PowerFest_%2794", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SC1r1UEX48", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114272\n"}
