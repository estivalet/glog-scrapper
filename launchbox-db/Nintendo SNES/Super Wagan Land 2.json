{"name": "Super Wagan Land 2", "overview": "Super Wagan Land 2 is the second Super Famicom outing for Namco's diminutive dinosaur Wagan. The game actually follows immediately after the third and final Famicom entry, Wagan Land 3, and continues the story from where it left off. As with earlier games in the series, the goal is to get Wagan to the end of each level, occasionally stopping to take part in mini-games such as shiritori (a Japanese word game) and an image puzzle game where the player has to decipher a heavily pixelated image and name the character in the picture. Super Wagan Land 2 was followed by Wagan Paradise on the Super Famicom the following year.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 25, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82365\n"}
