{"name": "Sunset Riders", "overview": "You're the fastest gun in the West and a bounty hunter voted most popular by the Dodge City Undertaker's Union. But look what's waiting to knock you off your high horse: Shotgun blast for shotgun blast, this game features the same 7 levels you had a showdown with at the arcade. Doesn't that make your trigger finger itch like crazy?! Lead will fly non-stop from authentic old west towns, to desert ambush zones, to Indian villages. Catching up to train robbers and stagecoach bandits will not only exhaust your horse, it'll make you feel like you've just run a marathon with a cactus in your shorts. Search for the hideouts of Hawkeye Hank Hatfield, the Smith Brothers and other notorious outlaws. Along the way be sure to round up special weapons that'll quicken your draw and double your firepower. As a real ladies' man, you'll also be rewarded handsomely for your efforts off the trail. Talk about riding into the sunset! If you think beans and a campfire don't mix, wait'll you see what hits the fan when you mix it up with desperadoes in the bonus bounty stage. Not enough? Oh, buffalo chips - you know it is! Heck, even Clint in his prime (many moons ago) would find this game a fistful.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 5, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Riders", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35yi4ztwVwA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3104\n"}
