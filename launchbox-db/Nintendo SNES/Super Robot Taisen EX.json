{"name": "Super Robot Taisen EX", "overview": "Super Robot Taisen EX is a spin-off entry in the Super Robot Taisen series. It stars characters original to the series that were introduced in previous games, instead of the anime TV heroes that the main line games focus on. The game is set after the third Super Robot War and sees protagonist Masaki return to his homeland of La Gias, located on the inner surface of the hollow Earth. He finds the land engulfed in a civil war, and quickly decides to join the fight to restore peace. He soon learns that people from La Gias have opened gates to the surface, summoning robot pilots to join the war against their will, thus introducing both allies and enemies from the past wars into this new conflict. Among those summoned is Ryune, who, upon learning of the situation, decides to seek other summoned friends and help them before trying to return home. Unlike the straight science fiction scenario of the earlier games, EX goes for more of a fantasy flavor, with a medieval setting and a world of faeries, spirits, demons and magically-powered robots crossing with the hi-tech robots from the surface. The game consists of three separate campaigns plus a short training scenario: one for Masaki (easy difficulty), one for Ryune (medium difficulty) and one for a mysterious third character who was believed killed in the previous game (hard difficulty).", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Winky Soft", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gtcif-aMf4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31406\n"}
