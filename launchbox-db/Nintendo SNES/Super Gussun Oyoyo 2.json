{"name": "Super Gussun Oyoyo 2", "overview": "Super Gussun Oyoyo 2 is a block-stacking puzzle game and the sequel to Super Gussun Oyoyo, which itself was a remastered version of the original Gussun Oyoyo arcade game. Unlike its predecessor, Super Gussun Oyoyo 2 is exclusive to the Super Famicom console. The game makes a few significant changes to the original Super Gussun Oyoyo. The most apparent of which is its new setting of a tropical island with an active volcano: many stages will start dropping fireballs the longer the player takes, which must be avoided at all costs. The game also features a new \"Puzzle Mode\" which plays similarly to those found in Tetris sequels: the player has a limited number of pre-determined pieces and must figure out how to use them to get their little bald friend to the end.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 24, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kan's", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14294\n"}
