{"name": "Clay Fighter: Tournament Edition", "overview": "Clay never had it so good. This outrageous new Clay Fighter Tournament Edition lets you smack it out with up to eight friends at a time. So, let the clay fly. More punching power with three and four hit combos and faster game speed (twice as fast as the original!) More balanced game play increases your chance of survival. Set up single elimination, double elimination and sudden death tournaments with four or eight of your friends - or use the tournament format to match your skills against the computer. Keep track of your tournament with the Tournament Ladder - complete with winners and losers brackets. Expanded voice over gives you more trash talking and blow-by-blow descriptions throughout the game. Brighter bolder graphics and awesome new clay backgrounds. Pick a name, any name, to customize your character.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visual Concepts", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClayFighter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6legpQmOYuM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1696\n"}
