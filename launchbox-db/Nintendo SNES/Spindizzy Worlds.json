{"name": "Spindizzy Worlds", "overview": "SPINDIZZY WORLDS! JOIN THE REVOLUTION! THE PLACE. A solar system layered with clusters of worlds so perilous, nothing but top speed and intense coordination can transport you from sphere to sphere! While spinning through multiple dangers, objects, and aliens, you must gather the jewels, fuel and bonus levels needed to win your way to more difficult and complex worlds. THE TIME. In such places, minutes become seconds and seconds slip by ...you're always on the verge of time running out. Since fuel supplies deplete quickly and must constantly be replenished, only bold, expert explorers beam themselves into such lethal arenas - but the payoffs are big! THE CHALLENGE. You may get safety from place to place by using lifts or ramps, and by collecting jewels and energy crystals. But danger lurks in every corner, and keeping yourself from the jaws of destruction is an incredible challenge.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 7, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASCII Corporation", "publishers": "ASCII Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5853\n"}
