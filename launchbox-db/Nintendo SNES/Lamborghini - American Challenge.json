{"name": "Lamborghini: American Challenge", "overview": "Imagine speeding along endless American highways in the fastest sports car in the world, racing against a multitude of artificially intelligent competitors in a bid to become the world number one. Well now your greatest fantasies can come true as you take the wheel of a Lamborghini Diablo in an attempt to become king of the Saturday Night races, an internal tournament in which eighteen drivers battle it out to become the world's greatest. Lamborghini American Challenge will test your driving skills but you must also be good at handling money, as each race requires an entrance fee which increases along with the challenge. Money can be gained by placing bets, which in turn can be spent on helpful power-ups and parts to enhance your car's performance. One final word of advice... watch out for those cops! Ready, get set, GO!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Titus", "publishers": "Titus", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3623\n"}
