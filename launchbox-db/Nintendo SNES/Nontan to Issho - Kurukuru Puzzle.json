{"name": "Nontan to Issho: Kurukuru Puzzle", "overview": "Nontan to Issho: Kuru Kuru Puzzle is a game based on a children\u2019s anime and book series telling the story of a young kitten and his animal friends. It is a block puzzle game the likes of Tetris and Baku Baku Animal, where the goal is to stack blocks in a way that matching ones are connected and therefore disappear. Unlike in Tetris games though, the blocks cannot be rotated \u2013 they can instead be flipped around to reveal different blocks on the reverse side. There\u2019s also the usual bonus blocks that remove entire rows, as is common in this genre. A two-player mode is also featured, even though unlike what usually happens in two-player gameplay of puzzle games, the actions of one player will not affect the other directly (like having more blocks falling on your opponent\u2019s screen after you scored pretty high).", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Freak", "publishers": "Victor Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82292\n"}
