{"name": "Micro Machines", "overview": "210 Mph across the bathroom floor! Through the bubbles like a rocket, you flip your speed boat around the drain, ricochet off the rubber ducky, and slip cozily back into first... Welcome to Micro Machines, the game where you get to race eight itty-bitty, turbo-charged, lightning-spewing vehicles - on 28 different circuits. Cruise a hot rod across the living room floor. Race a Formula 1 around the pool table. Command a chopper over your neighbor's flower garden. It's big fun on a, uh... small scale. Just be sure to stay clear of that nasty soap scum!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Merit Studios", "publishers": "Ocean of America", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2677\n"}
