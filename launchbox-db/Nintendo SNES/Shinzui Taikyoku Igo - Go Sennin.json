{"name": "Shinzui Taikyoku Igo: Go Sennin", "overview": "Shinzui Taikyoku Igo: Go Sennin (\"The Essence of Playing Go: Go Hermit\") is a Go game from Jorudan and J-Wing. It is a fairly straightforward and barebones adaptation of the popular Asian board game: the player selects whether they are black or white, whether the game is for one human player or two, and the difficulty of their CPU opponent in the case of single-player out of ten possible ranks. The game then resumes on a traditional 19x19 grid, where the player to take the most spaces on the board is the winner.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 2, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jorudan", "publishers": "J-Wing", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89495\n"}
