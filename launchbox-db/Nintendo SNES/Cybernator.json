{"name": "Cybernator", "overview": "2065 AD. The nations of Earth have once again split into two major powers. The line dividing these new arch enemies reaches as far as the lunar frontier, where axis forces have constructed a moon base capable of launching monolithic intergalactic battle cruisers. To thwart this threat, a covert strike team consisting of the marines' elite Cybernator force has been mobilized. The Cybernator is a giant mechanical warrior controlled by a marine who sits in the command cockpit within the unit's chromium cranium. Nuclear Fission Thrusters allow the Cybernator to wreak total havoc while soaring from ground zero to the infinity of space. Your mission is to take command of the Cybernator and confront the most powerful enemy ever to explode onto the Super NES scene. You'll face an awesome display of graphic destruction and realistic carnage so intense you'll fell compelled to run and hide. The sound effects alone will make your guts shake as if they were in front of a cranked-up heavy metal concert speaker. But you must fight on, toughing it out through 7 war zones stretching from the moon, through the expanses of space, to the fringes of Earth's fragile atmosphere. Crush Axis Cybertroops. Find your way through a dark mountain maze with only your wits and a small light. And capture power-ups that you can allocate to the Cybernator's four different weapons systems. Until you accomplish your mission. Or have your nuts and bolts splattered from here to eternity.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NCS Corporation", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernator", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GveShUl5rdk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1511\n"}
