{"name": "New 3D Golf Simulation: Harukanaru Augusta", "overview": "Harukanaru Augusta is the first title of the Harukanaru Augusta franchise and the first of many golf simulation games from T&E Soft based on US courses to be released on the Super Nintendo, as well as on the Genesis and Japanese home computers. Both it and True Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club were released in the same year of 1991, with the Japanese release of Waialae and True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links the following year. Harukanaru Augusta is an in-depth golf simulator, rather than an Arcade-style golf game. It has a lot of customization options for the player's stance and clubs, and the player can consider the wind direction and topography before every swing. The golfers are depicted as digitized sprites of actors, both in the portraits and whenever the player's character takes a swing.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 5, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft, Inc.", "publishers": "T&E Soft, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73460\n"}
