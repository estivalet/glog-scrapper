{"name": "Super Game Boy 2", "overview": "The Super Game Boy 2 was released exclusively in Japan in 1998. Additions included a link port to allow a user to access two-player mode via the link cable, the green game link LED, and the red power LED indicator, and runs at the exact speed of the Game Boy (the original model runs 2.4% faster than a Game Boy). In addition, it came with eight new default borders, which replaced those in the original model (though the old borders are still accessible via a code); however, it retained the same built-in palettes and coloring tools as on the original model. Also, this version of the SGB does not allow one to change borders in some games that have built-in borders. Some games have features only available through the Super Game Boy 2, such as a special Tetris DX border.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 30, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Game_Boy#Super_Game_Boy_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87588\n"}
