{"name": "Kidou Senshi Z Gundam: Away to the Newtype", "overview": "Kidou Senshi Z Gundam: Away to the NewType (\"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: Away to the Newtype\") is a strategy game and part of the Gundam universe of video game adaptations. It is specifically based on the second incarnation of the anime series, Zeta Gundam, which revisits the original series Mobile Suit Gundam (also known as \"Gundam 0079\" to distinguish it from its sequels) eight years after the climactic conclusion of the One Year War. The game is built on the blueprint of the 1995 Super Famicom isometric strategy game Cross Dimension 0079. It offers a similar interface and adherence to the lore with an ample number of cutscenes. Away to the Newtype also incorporates elements of the 1986 Famicom action game Hot Scramble, also based on the Zeta manga/anime series, for its \"long range\" combat mode. This mode plays like a first-person shooter and was one of the three modes that comprises Hot Scramble.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26561\n"}
