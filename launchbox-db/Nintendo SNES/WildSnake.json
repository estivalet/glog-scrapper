{"name": "WildSnake", "overview": "A deadly nest of snakes. And only you can keep them from getting out! Maneuver each new snake so it touches another of the same kind, making the venomous viper disappear. Sound easy? As long as you con keep matching up snakes, you're in control. But when those poisonous reptiles pile close to the top, you better run for your life! If you're lucky, a King Cobra might appear and devour ever snake in its path. Or the powerful flashing Wild Snake could rid you of all the snakes of one color. But remember, snakes like a challenge, and they move faster and faster as your skills improve.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Manley & Associates", "publishers": "Spectrum Holobyte", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6062\n"}
