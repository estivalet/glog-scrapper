{"name": "Super V.G: Variable Geo", "overview": "A one-on-one fighter game with all an-female cast. In the near-future, a martial arts tournament is held to determine Japan's strongest woman. The competitors are required to work as waitresses for the tournament sponsors, all restaurants, between bouts to drum up business for them and fund the contest. The stage for each character is the restaurant where they work, each with different themes. Super Variable Geo is the Super Famicom down-scaled port of Advanced V.G. for the PC Engine CD, which would also be adapted for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation. It removes the animated cutscenes and CD audio, as well as the boss characters and the clone of the protagonist Yuka that was added to Advanced V.G.. The game also eschews the original's pornographic content (which is also excised from the PlayStation version, while the Saturn version allows the player to toggle the option) where competitors are \"humiliated\" in cutscenes after losing.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TGL", "publishers": "TGL", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXbWxtL6XSc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33558\n"}
