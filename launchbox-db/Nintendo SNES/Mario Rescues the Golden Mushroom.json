{"name": "Mario Rescues the Golden Mushroom", "overview": "The Golden Mushroom was stolen by Bowser! Mario must defeat him and retrieve it to return to the Mushroom Kingdom! This newest version of the hack (V1.1.4) fixes issues such as skippable and enterable unrevealed levels, HDMA gradients showing up during transition black screens and the music staying sped up after beating a level with the time below 100 seconds. And cutscenes are now skippable and the final boss is now easier. A Portuguese (Brazil) langauage version is also included. I've been working on this hack for over 2 years.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 13, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Rom Hacks", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125241\n"}
