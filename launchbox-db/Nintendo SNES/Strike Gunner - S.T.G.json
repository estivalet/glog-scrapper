{"name": "Strike Gunner: S.T.G", "overview": "In the last years of the 20th century, the nations of the world have united to dismantle their massive arsenals of nuclear doom. But the dictator of Sovinia, a small rebel nation, still dreams of world domination. He has joined forces with a huge, hostile war force from beyond this planet. The Allied Countries of Earth try to resist, but without nuclear weapons, their efforts are futile. Then, in an ironic twist, the alien forces turn against their ally, and set out to complete their conquest and colonization of Earth. Now, with the survival of the human race at stake, the Allied Countries join forces with the rebel dictatorship in a last-ditch effort to drive out the invaders. At their secret fortress deep in the Amazon Jungle, the greatest scientists of Earth carefully analyze the alien weaponry, and develop the weapon to end all weapons: Strike Gunner. With time running out and few resources remaining, only two can be built; but those two can combine at will into one superfighter of astonishing power. With an awesome arsenal of offensive and defensive devices at your command, and your own unmatched courage and skill as a fighter pilot, the Earth may yet be saved!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Athena", "publishers": "Athena", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2328\n"}
