{"name": "Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone", "overview": "Take off from your carrier and get ready for 16 MEG supersonic action with TURN AND BURN: NO-FLY ZONE! Strapped into the cockpit of the Navy's sleek and lethal F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, you'll fly blue water operations against a hilly-rotational Mode 7 horizon and search the heavens for your prey with an impressive array of avionic technology! Unparalleled 16-bit sound barrier-blasting dogfights make for a senses-shattering combat simulation that will blow you away! You've never experienced air-to-air battles like these before - unless you've flown the real thing! Daring nighttime carrier landings test your flying skills as never before! An on-board, nose-mounted camera records and displays full-motion video sequences of your kills! Target enemy MiGs with the detailed Heads-Up Display, then pump them with the M61A1 Vulcan cannon or slam Sidewinder and Phoenix missiles into their tails to send them down in flames!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagineering", "publishers": "Absolute Entertainment", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.53", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6031\n"}
