{"name": "Super Metroid Redesign: Axeil", "overview": "9 years of on and off work has finally paid off. I tried my best to follow all the negative feedback from players and deliver something more fluid. there's a lot of extras added into this game too. So I'd suggest giving it a try even if you've already played the original Redesign in the past. I'm listening to critiques so if you have problems please let me know and I'll see what I can do to fix it.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 4, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Drewseph", "publishers": "Metroid Construction", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133531\n"}
