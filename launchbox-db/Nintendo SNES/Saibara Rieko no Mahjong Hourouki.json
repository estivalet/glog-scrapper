{"name": "Saibara Rieko no Mahjong Hourouki", "overview": "Saibara Rieko no Mahjong Hourouki (\"Rieko Saibara's Mahjong Travelogue\", roughly) is a mahjong game for the Super Famicom that features the art of its namesake Rieko Saibara, a moderately famous manga artist that focuses on \"slice of life\" manga strips. The game is filled with her distinct and cartoony style, from the portraits of the mahjong players to the background and title screen characters. The game itself is a traditional four-player mahjong simulator: players aim to be the first to acquire a winning hand, winning a number of points from their opponents conditional on the quality of their tile combos. The first game to carry her name, Rieko Saibara would later contribute her brand and art style to additional mahjong games for the Sony PlayStation and Game Boy Advance between 1998 and 2001.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 12, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Taito Corporation", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88696\n"}
