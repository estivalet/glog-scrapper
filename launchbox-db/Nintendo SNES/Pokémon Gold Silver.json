{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Gold Silver", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Gold Silver is a platformer based on Pokemon made by an unknown developer for SNES. You can play as two characters, Chikorita (misspelled \"Chokorita\") and Waninoko (Totodile). The game has a total of four stages, and then a final boss which is Mewtwo. Since the game uses the same engine as Digimon Adventure and Pocket Monster, the gameplay is identical in control and physics. Although there is a character select screen at the beginning, the player can switch between characters freely by pressing Select. Chikorita can temporarily fly by tapping A, while pressing A as Waninoko makes the screen flash and freeze nearby enemies for a short period.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105876\n"}
