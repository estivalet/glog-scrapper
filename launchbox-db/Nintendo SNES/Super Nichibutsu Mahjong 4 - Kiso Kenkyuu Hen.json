{"name": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 4: Kiso Kenkyuu Hen", "overview": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 4: Kiso Kenkyuu Hen (\"Basic Research Edition\") is a mahjong game for the Super Famicom and the fourth and final game in the Super Nichibutsu Mahjong series. As with its prequels, it features scantily-clad women in its menus, but uses high-school students and teachers as the game's opponents. The game allows for two-, three- or four-player games of mahjong and also includes a story mode of sorts as the player character (male or female, with three avatar choices for each) takes on opponents in their school's mahjong club.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90007\n"}
