{"name": "SimCity", "overview": "Start with a fledgling town (you name it yourself) and build it into a metropolis. Or, take on the challenge of rescuing a city overwhelmed with problems. Either way, taxes, zoning, crime, transportation, education, fire control, and other critical issues are in your hands. Time is passing, and every decision you make has a future consequence. Your assistant, Dr. Wright, can help you make the right decisions. Just ask! Surprise catastrophes also threaten your growing city--fire, earthquakes, airplane crashes, even a giant Koopa who has a nose for industrial pollution! Will you build the ideal city? Or will disgruntled citizens leave you with a ghost town?", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 26, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bjEYtjQgmo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32199\n"}
