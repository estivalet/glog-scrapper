Whether it was dinosaur demolition or pterodactyl hang-glidin\u2019, life for the boys was pretty cool. Cool, that is, until a bogus bunch of neanderthal nerds crashed their village and scared off all the cave-babes. Now the cave-babes are out there - SOMEWHERE, lost and reeeeally lonely\u2026 so what are you waitin\u2019 for? It\u2019s up to Joe and Mac to get \u2018em back. * Fight flying pterodactyls in one or two-player simultaneous play. * 12 cliff-hangin\u2019 levels with more than 6 bonus levels to find\u2026 * Amazing arcade graphics will keep you clubbin\u2019 to find your babes\u2026 * Joe & Mac\u2019s pre-hysterical escapades will keep you comin\u2019 back for more!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 6, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_%26_Mac", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M45G5VQ5F28", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17295\n"}
