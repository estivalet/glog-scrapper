{"name": "Yoshi's Cookie", "overview": "Mario and Yoshi are filling in at the Cookie Factory, and the snacks are piling high! As fresh-baked cookies roll out of the ovens, it's up to Mario to sort and stack 'em before they pile too high! Line up a row of the same kind of cookies either vertically or horizontally, and they vanish! Clear the screen to move on to a new level of cookie chaos. Yoshi appears from time to time to stir things up. Play for high score or go head-to-head against a friend or the computer. The mouth-watering madness doesn't let up!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 9, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s_Cookie", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFWa5Xhr9Hw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6082\n"}
