It has not been officially translated into English, although there are some fan translations available on the Internet. The goal of the game is to defeat the player's opponent by popping balloons that are arranged above the character's head. The energy gauge gives the chance to perform special attacks or call in help from Tuxedo Mask, who throws roses to pop the highest row of balloons. This gauge increases once every other time a shot destroyed a balloon. If the energy gauge is full, the Sailor Senshi character can perform a special attack. Two-Player Mode - In the two-player mode, the player can play against another person or CPU character, as any of the Inner Sailor Guardians, Sailor Chibi Moon, or any of the Outer Sailor Guardians except for Sailor Saturn. Story Mode - In the story mode, the only playable characters are the Inner Senshi and Sailor Chibi Moon. The object is to defeat all the Senshi except Sailor Saturn, who acts as an advisor. The final boss in the mode is a clone of the player's character.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 8, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Create", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28908\n"}
