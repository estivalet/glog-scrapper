Explosive aerial combat action as you intercept enemy aircraft or \"take out\" strategic ground targets - missile sites, bunkers, airfields, and buildings. View all the action in \"first-person\" perspective from the cockpit of your F-16 Falcon. The first mention of Falcon being in development was in the April 1992 issue of Gamepro. It was in a listing of games shown at the 1992 Winter CES. The July 1992 issue of Nintendo Power stated that it was headed for the Super NES by early 1993. The prototype version of the game is merely a demo. There is essentially no gameplay in it.
