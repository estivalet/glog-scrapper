{"name": "Super Mario World Challenges", "overview": "Super Mario World Challenges was originally an EDP (EvilDaizo Productions) exclusive hack from 2013 where every single level takes stages from the original game and remixes them into more \"challenging\" versions, effectively giving them unique experiences. Think the postgame of Super Mario 3D Land, but a little more elaborate. It was not submitted back then simply due to stricter hack guidelines, but I am more confident to release this on SMW Central in 2021. Since the original version, there have been some major changes: - For all the stages from the original SMW Challenges, each one contains a custom song composed by me. - The original levels have been tweaked for better feel. - The Red Switch Palace can now be found somewhere in the game to make a few obstacles much easier. - Brand new bonus stages have been added, replacing the old 30 Dragon Coin reward (now accessible with 25 instead). - Completely rewritten dialogue for the various info boxes and castle destruction cutscenes. - Several easter eggs to find and hunt down. - Fifteen new dragon coins to find. - A brand new boss at the very, very end.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 27, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daizo Dee Von", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158809\n"}
