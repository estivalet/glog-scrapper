{"name": "SD The Great Battle: Aratanaru Chousen", "overview": "SD The Great Battle is a top-down platformer/shooter that features characters from the Ultraman, Kamen Rider and Mobile Suit Gundam universes. It is the first game in what would be known as the Compati Hero Series. As well as for stylistic reasons, characters are super deformed -- turned into cartoonish caricatures with large heads and small bodies -- so that characters from the three franchises can be depicted at heights comparative to one another. Normally, Kamen Rider characters are human-sized whereas most Gundam Mobile Suits and Ultraman (and his kaiju opponents) are around 50-200 feet tall.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 29, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26619\n"}
