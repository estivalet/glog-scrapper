Waaaagh! Quicker than you can say MC2, you're screaming around 48 tracks in 12 bizarre star systems. Blasting across planets no one's ever seen, and blowing your prize bucks on boosters, attractor beams, armor and upgrades. Whatever it takes to come out ahead. Or is that........ two heads? Top Gear 3000.
