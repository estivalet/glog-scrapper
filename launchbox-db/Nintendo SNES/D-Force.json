If you're quick enough, you'll command the latest Nuclear Apache Helicopter, D-Force, through 7 bone-crushing levels. You'll roam six countries on your seemingly endless search for a powerful oil-rich Mid-Eastern Dictator. If you fail, we'll all be learning a new language soon! Comprende? We've created the most intense, physically demanding game around! With selectable weapons, quick zoom, 16 bit graphics, and a massive 8 MEG game pak, we don't want to hear any whining. D-Force utilizes thousands of colors and special effects, giving you the ultimate test on the Super NES. D-Force is nearly impossible & downright unforgettable!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cream", "publishers": "Asmik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.78", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Force", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEfwf15YlRY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1700\n"}
