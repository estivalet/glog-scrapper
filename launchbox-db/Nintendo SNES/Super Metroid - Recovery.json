{"name": "Super Metroid: Recovery", "overview": "Samus has lost her upgrades (again) after her mission on SR388. Journey with her back to Zebes to find the Infant Metroid and to recover her lost abilities. This hack takes the map of the original game and brings a new spin on what you think of as Super Metroid. Explore reimagined rooms with a new item and boss order, as well as two extra minibosses. Many quality-of-life patches and hex tweaks have been applied to make your playing experience smooth. Though for the most part as difficult as the original, there are some parts that are much more difficult. Will Samus be able to recover her upgrades, or will the universe be doomed to domination by the evil Space Pirates?", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 5, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MetroidNerd#9001", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163766\n"}
