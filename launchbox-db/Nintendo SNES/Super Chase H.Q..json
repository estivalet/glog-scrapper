The city passes in a blur, then some fool pulls out in front of you! Tires scream and snarl, grabbing the road as you slam on the brakes and whistle past a telephone pole! You race back up to 200 m.p.h. and close on the criminals.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito Corporation", "publishers": "Taito Corporation", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5877\n"}
