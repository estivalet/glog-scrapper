{"name": "GeGeGe No Kitarou: Youkai Donjaara", "overview": "Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Donjaara is a combination puzzle/board game for the Super Famicom based on the spooky kids' anime Gegege no Kitarou. It focuses on the titular game of donjaara, a simplified version of mahjong for children, but also features a number of other mini-games involving tiles such as a memory matching game and one where four players attempt to take the most territory on a grid. Youkai Donjaara was part of a series of games Bandai published for their Sufami Turbo peripheral in 1996. This device could play special smaller carts that were cheaper for Bandai to produce, and as such the game cannot be played without the peripheral. It launched with two versions: one that included the peripheral as a pack-in, and one that did not.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 19, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Create", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73294\n"}
