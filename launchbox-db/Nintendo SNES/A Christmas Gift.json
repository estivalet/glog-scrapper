{"name": "A Christmas Gift", "overview": "My gift to you, the SMW Central community! This is a very short hack, I would expect the average playthrough to take at most 1 hour. All levels are short and are relatively easy without being too free. This hack has no overworld and instant-retry, it is built with speedrunning in mind. I hope you enjoy it, happy holidays!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 11, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The_Uber_Camper", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158799\n"}
