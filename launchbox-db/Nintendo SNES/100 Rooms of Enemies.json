{"name": "100 Rooms of Enemies", "overview": "Do you like the \"Pit of 100 Trials\" side-challenges from the Paper Mario games? If you did, then you'll sure like this concept. 100 Rooms of Enemies is a enemy rush platformer that consists of 100 setups for the player to go through. Think of this as if you're in an arcade game; you essentially try to improve your record as you die many times. If you succeed to conquer Room 100, you'll be prized with a reward that stands as a reminder that you completed the game. What kind of prize? You'll have to improve all of your skills to find out! There are two versions of 100 Rooms of Enemies that you can try out: -100 Rooms of Enemies (Arcade Mode) A mode where you can die up to 5 times before restarting... -100 Rooms of Enemies (Do or Die Mode) A mode where you only have one shot to get through all 100 rooms. How far can you go in this mode?! Now here's my question: do you have the strategies and skills to conquer all 100 Rooms?", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 24, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daizo Dee Von", "publishers": "Daizo Dee Von", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1cvfk4AS2A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99237\n"}
