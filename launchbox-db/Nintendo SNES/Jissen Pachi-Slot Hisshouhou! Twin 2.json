{"name": "Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou! Twin 2", "overview": "Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou! Twin 2 is a pachi-slots (slot machine) game from Sammy Corporation. Both it and its predecessor Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou! Twin are spin-offs of Sammy's larger Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou! series, which uses virtual facsimiles for real pachi-slot machines. The Twin spin-offs are so named because of the fact they only represent two machines each. Twin 2 features two machines for pachi-slot fanatics to practice on: one has a tokusatsu theme, and the other uses a frog mascot.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 12, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sammy", "publishers": "Sammy", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87499\n"}
