{"name": "Donkey Kong Country: Boss Blitz", "overview": "This is a hack that transforms Donkey Kong Country into a boss rush mode. Can you make it through all 7 bosses unscathed? Multiple options can be chosen for battles. Version 1.5 now has all of the features that DKC2: Brigand Barrage does, notably: You can choose to play as a two-player team in addition to going it alone. If playing alone, you can choose whether you start as Donkey Kong or Diddy, and whether the other Kong is present (For a challenge, try fighting all of the bosses as Diddy alone). Alternate color palettes can be chosen for the Kongs, not unlike Super Smash Bros. and other fighting games. You can also choose to fight individual bosses in addition to battling them all in succession. Best times are now saved to battery-backed memory for each individual boss, as well as the total. You may also notice that a few sound effects have been fixed, and some animations are more fluid than they are in the original game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 9, 2017", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mattrizzle", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116154\n"}
