{"name": "Kishin Douji Zenki: Tenchi Meidou", "overview": "A licensed game featuring the characters and story beats from the Kishin Douji Zenki anime and manga. The game follows Chiaki Enno, a descendant of the master priest who sealed away the evil Goddess Karuma, and Zenki, the spirit guardian Chiaki's ancestor allied with, in a quest to once again defeat Karuma now that she has resurfaced. The game employees an unusual structure which combines elements of board games, puzzle games and strategy games. Chiaki and Zenki move a certain number of spaces across a board determined by a dice roll. The player can also spend movement points on moving the tiles around the world, which is often necessary to create a route to the exit. If the player bumps into one of Karuma's eyeball minions, the game switches to a battle in which Zenki and his opponent draw cards and attack based on the icon on the card: these might involve fireballs, martial arts or spirit beams. It is possible to use special abilities to wipe enemies off the board, preventing the necessity of fighting them and minimizing the chance of Zenki falling in combat before the player can win the board. More special abilities become unlocked as the player progresses.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 23, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hudson", "publishers": "Hudson", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18071\n"}
