{"name": "Chibi Maruko-Chan: Mezase! Minami no Island!!", "overview": "Chibi Maruko-Chan: Mezase! Minami no Island!! (\"Chibi Maruko-Chan: Take Aim! South Island!!\") is an anime licensed game based on Chibi Maruko-Chan, a slice-of-life manga about a grade-schooler, her friends and her family. The game is a loose collection of different mini-games and utilities intended for a younger audience, a dodgeball game set on a Bomberman grid, a painting game that plays like competitive Snake, and a sumo-like game on a floating platform in a pool. It also features a single-player story mode, in which interstitial text-heavy story cutscenes set the stage for the mini-games, as well as modes that let up to four players try each mini-game directly.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcWC9L7DOgA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/49947\n"}
