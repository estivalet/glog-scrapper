{"name": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Sailor Stars: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2", "overview": "Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Sailor Stars: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2 (\"Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Sailor Stars: Floating Panic 2\") is a Sailor Moon licensed game and the sequel to Bandai's 1995 game Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic. It is based on the fifth season of Sailor Moon, Sailor Stars, and features the Sailor Senshi as they appeared in that series. The game was part of Bandai's Sufami Turbo range, published between June and September of 1996. These games were published on special smaller carts that Bandai produced at lower costs than the standard Super Famicom carts and required a peripheral to play. Two versions of Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2 were produced: one that came with the Sufami Turbo peripheral as a pack-in, and one that did not. The game features similar gameplay to its predecessor, with players inflating and popping balloons with their magical projectiles. Popping balloons that are adjacent to other balloons of the same color is the key to earning magic power to cast spells, which can rescue the player or cause trouble for their opponent. Along with the spells, the player can occasionally acquire one-use power-ups that expand the coverage of their projectiles. In addition to the versus mode, the game also has a puzzle mode where the goal is to finish each arrangement of balloons with a limited number of shots.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44114\n"}
