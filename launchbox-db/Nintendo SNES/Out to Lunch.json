{"name": "Out to Lunch", "overview": "LOST YOUR LUNCH? Please help me! I am the world-famous Pierre Le Chef. This world cooking tour was to have been my greatest, but yikes! The ingredients I need to make my super-duper masterpieces have disappeared! My eggs have escaped, my potatoes have been pilfered Heck! All my food has gone bonkers! No I must chase this crazy food across six countries through 48 challenging levels, bean 'em with flourbags and catch 'em in my net! This won't be easy \u2014 that dastardly Le Chef Noir and his helpers, Botulism, Mold and Salmonella, are really giving me a hard time! We'd better get cooking or this will become a real food fight! 6 wild scenes from 6 cool countries! 48 zany levels of play, and bonus levels too! Over 1,000 frames of super-fun cartoon animation! Dozens of goofy ingredients and enemies to chase and get chased by!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mindscape", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5499\n"}
