{"name": "Mario Superstar", "overview": "\"A hack created with the help of one TLMB (I did the coding, he did the level design and graphics) for a contest, which it won first place in. In this game, Mario can't jump on enemies as he usually can. Instead, Mario is equipped with a net with which he can capture enemies. When Mario captures an enemy, he takes something from them which he uses to destroy his enemies, a \"power\" if you would. This is just a single level, but it was a lot of fun to make.\"", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HuFlungDu", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9jn34eWNBI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104222\n"}
