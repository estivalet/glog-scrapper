{"name": "Super Kyoutei", "overview": "Super Kyoutei (\"Super Motorboat Racing\") is a simulation game from Nihon Bussan (a.k.a. Nichibutsu) in which the player bets on and sponsors motorboat racing. The game is structurally similar to the Super Famicom's many horseracing sims: races are automatically played out by the CPU and the player interaction is limited to the simulation elements. The player can also create their own races with carefully defined parameters, possibly to simulate real-world motorboat races that the player wishes to put money on. The game followed the similarly-themed Jissen Kyoutei, published by Imagineer earlier the same month. It saw a sequel in 1996's Super Kyoutei 2.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 30, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89996\n"}
