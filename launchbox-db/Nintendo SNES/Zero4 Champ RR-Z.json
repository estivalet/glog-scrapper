{"name": "Zero4 Champ RR-Z", "overview": "Sequel to Zero4 Champ RR, and the fourth installment in the Zero4 Champ series. The protagonist of the previous game has become the street racing champion of his city, but was later humiliated by the crowd because he lost an unimportant race. Offended, the hero moves to another city and decides to build up his career from scratch. Like the previous entries in the series, the game contains a story mode and a versus mode, adding to those a \"mini-story mode\", in which the player drives some of the best cars in the game in unique scenarios (one of which, for example, involves traveling to the past and racing there in a Back to the Future style). The story mode involves buying new cars, customizing them with parts, and winning races to earn money and gain access to better vehicles. Various mini-games are available by selecting locations on the city map, such as for example playing pachinko slot machines to earn money, etc.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Rings Corporation", "publishers": "Media Rings Corporation", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26596\n"}
