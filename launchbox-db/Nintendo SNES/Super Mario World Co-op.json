{"name": "Super Mario World Co-op", "overview": "Super Mario World Co-op is a super Nintendo ROM hack based on the Super Mario World SNES Game. This is a 2-player simultaneous version of the game \u2013 it\u2019s Super Mario World multiplayer! Mario and Luigi are on the screen at the same time! The second Mario character has a little less functionality than the first player. Also it cannot interact with Yoshi. Each player has the same number of lives. Makes sense. Each player can be bumped off by the other from a platform, losing a life. Certain blocks within the ROM hack cannot be grabbed by Luigi. So, as the game suggests this has to be a coop game. There is the option to save after every level.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 12, 2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Noobish Noobsicle", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115197\n"}
