{"name": "Super Pachinko", "overview": "Super Pachinko is a 1994 Super Famicom pachinko game. The game switches between a top-down mode, which features a protagonist (male or female) walking around interacting with pachinko machines and NPCs, and the various pachinko machines the protagonist visits to win money. The game takes into account the amount of time the protagonist takes to travel to the various pachinko parlors, and how long they spend there. The game features over 30 different pachinko machines, all of which require a slightly different approach and can be collected back at the protagonist's home.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Betop", "publishers": "I'Max Corp.", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90050\n"}
