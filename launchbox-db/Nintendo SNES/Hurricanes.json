{"name": "Hurricanes", "overview": "The Hurricanes have been challenged by their long time enemies, the Gorgons, to a match to determine the best soccer team in the world. The Hurricanes must make their way from their home on Hispanola Island to the Gorgons' stadium on the island of Garkos. If the Hurricanes don't make it to the stadium on time, they must forfeit the match. Play as either Cal, or Napper and make your way through five action-packed episodes - each set in a different location. Along the way you find puzzles and traps the Gorgons have placed in your way. Collect icons that give you added powers to assist you in overcoming the Gorgons and achieving your goal of arriving at the stadium in time for the big match.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3586\n"}
