{"name": "Dungeon Master", "overview": "Are you clever enough to solve an evil wizard's twisted puzzles? Do you possess the concentration needed to explore a labyrinth of mystery? Should you resist the tempting treasures, defeat the hideous monsters, and escape the devious traps that are hidden throughout the Grey Lord's dreadful dungeon? Yes? Then perhaps you'll be the one to enter the caves of the sacred mountain and retrieve the Firestaff from the evil Lord Chaos. To succeed, you must assemble a band of four champions and lead them in fierce battles against the terrible Dark Lord who now rules your master's dungeon. And if you fail? At best, you'll meet your ghastly end in the dungeon's wretched catacombs, like hundreds of brave adventurers who went before you. Far worse, you might become a captive \"trophy\" of the evil Lord Chaos, suspended forever in the haunting mirrors of the Hall of Champions.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FTL Games", "publishers": "JVC", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1528\n"}
