{"name": "Heisei Gunjin Shogi", "overview": "Heisei Gunjin Shogi (\"Heisei-Era Military Shogi\") is a shogi game exclusive to the Super Famicom. The player can select between a number of locations, such as a soccer stadium or office tower, each of which offers its own opponent that the player must defeat to move forward. The game uses the \"gunjin shogi\", or \"military shogi\", ruleset and plays a little differently than the standard shogi. Rather, it is closer to the board game Stratego, where the strength of the player's pieces are unknown to the opponent, and vice versa, until those pieces are fought in battle.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Triad", "publishers": "Carrozzeria", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87456\n"}
