Jo is into kendo, Japanese fencing, so her parents sent her to Japan to study under Osaki sensei. Osaki is the greatest sword master of all time, but he looks like a green haired cyperpunk. Just to crank up the strangeness Osaki gives you a talisman that transforms you into a seventies super hero. You've never seen action this crazy or fun. Kendo Rage is the rage. - 7 rounds of non-stop action - 8 mega packed with adventure, fun and cool animation. - Multi-directional attacks for 360 degrees of sword swinging! - Intense power up attacks! - Gaggles of goofy goons to bash!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 22, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Affect", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1898\n"}
