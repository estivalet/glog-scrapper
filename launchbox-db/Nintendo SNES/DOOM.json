{"name": "DOOM", "overview": "Welcome to Doom, soldier. Now shut up and start fighting because there's no time to waste! We're talking total war against the forces of evil with the only thing standing between civilization and the end of everything as we know it is you -- one angry Marine with a handgun and a bad attitude. This is the full-auto, 16-meg faithful version of the PC original. Which means all the same monsters, levels, weapons and surprises are around for a screaming fast descent into danger with sudden death lurking around every corner. Strap on your ammo and prepare to spit lead. Because now's your chance to be a hero. Or die trying.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "Williams Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_versions_of_Doom#Super_NES", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2727\n"}
