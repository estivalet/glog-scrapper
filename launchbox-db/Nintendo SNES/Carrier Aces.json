{"name": "Carrier Aces", "overview": "Battle in the air for control of the sea. As a Japanese or American World War II pilot, attack the enemy's ships in fighters, dive bombers, or torpedo bombers. Outfit an entire squadron in one of the seven campaign wars. But it won't be easy. Your opponent will send up defense fighters, and shoot you out of the sky with anti-aircraft fire. Destroy your target in brilliant split screen mode-7 graphics, and then, somehow coax your battered planes to your aircraft carrier. No time for rest; prepare your defenses because the enemy is coming after you. Play against the computer or a friend in this 16 meg airwar.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergistic Software", "publishers": "Cybersoft", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1538\n"}
