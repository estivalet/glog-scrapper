{"name": "Ultra Baseball Jitsumei Ban 3", "overview": "Ultra Baseball Jitsumei Ban 3 (\"Real Name Ultra Baseball 3\") is the sixth game in Culture Brain's Baseball Simulator 1.000/Ultra Baseball series. As with the previous two \"Jitsumei Ban\" games, the players and teams are all taken from the official Nippon Professional Baseball league during the 95/96 season, and many of them appear in the intro and on the box art as caricatures. The game features team customization options as well as standard exhibition, tournament and all-star modes. Every mode in the game offers the option of a CPU vs. CPU match if the player simply wants to watch a simulated game. The game also features the series's trademark \"Ultra\" teams, which are fictional teams/athletes that can call upon superpowers to increase their prowess as batters, pitchers and fielders.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Culture Brain", "publishers": "Culture Brain", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81741\n"}
