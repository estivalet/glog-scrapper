{"name": "Mario & Luigi: Kola Kingdom Quest", "overview": "Mario & Luigi: Kola Kingdom Quest is a reboot of Super Mario Bros. 5 Reborn. This 74-level hack uses many of the same tilesets and music tracks, and World themes, but contains completely redesigned levels and a new, much less blocky Overworld. It also features REAL HDMA gradients and custom Layer 3 images. Difficulty is probably comparable to the average Mario game. It starts out easy, but gets harder as the game progresses. Please check out KKQCredits.txt for known issues as well as credits, just in case you don\u2019t want to wait until the end of the game for that.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 26, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamma V", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126234\n"}
