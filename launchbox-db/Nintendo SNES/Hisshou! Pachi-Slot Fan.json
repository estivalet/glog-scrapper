{"name": "Hisshou! Pachi-Slot Fan", "overview": "Hisshou! Pachi-Slot Fan (\"Victory! Pachi-Slot Fan\") is a pachi-slot simulator. It was published on the Super Famicom in 1994 by Planning Office Wada (POW) and developed by an unknown contract developer. Despite using Hisshou in its title, it is not associated with the more famous Hisshou 777 Fighter or Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou franchises. The game frames its pachi-slot gameplay with a graphic adventure style story in which the player character can walk around a city, interact with NPCs and, of course, play the pachi-slots.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 16, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Planning Office Wada", "publishers": "Planning Office Wada", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87481\n"}
