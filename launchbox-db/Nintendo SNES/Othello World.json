{"name": "Othello World", "overview": "Othello World is an adaption of Othello/Reversi for the Super Famicom. The game is divided into several worlds, featuring CPU opponents of increasing difficulty with such origins as fairy tales, Alice in Wonderland, and the works of Shakespeare (calling back to the game's etymology). Each world has five opponents, and beating any three will unlock the next world. The game has passwords for continuing, which are given out between worlds. The final opponent is a god-like figure named Tamenori, named after Japanese Othello champion Hideshi Tamenori.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 5, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dice Co.
