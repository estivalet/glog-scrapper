{"name": "Super Mario World: Christmas Edition", "overview": "Super Mario World: Christmas Edition is a hack I made when I saw all the awesome Winter/Ice EXGFX made by the SMWCentral Community. Each level, except for the Switch Palaces, is Winter/Ice themed. I used all custom snow sprites that I could find and used them in many different ways. The .zip file contains an English and a German version of this hack. This hack is very traditional and awesome to play during the Christmas days with your friends or family! Merry Christmas!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 1, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nowieso", "publishers": "Nowieso", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY-SmeIJYTg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117660\n"}
