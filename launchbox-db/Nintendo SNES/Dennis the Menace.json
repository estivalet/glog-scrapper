{"name": "Dennis the Menace", "overview": "Yipes! Grab your slingshot, water pistol and peashooter. Margaret and Joey, Dennis' loyal friends, are missing and so is Mr. Wilson's valuable coin collection! Can Dennis sneak into Mr. Wilson's house and find his slingshot and peashooter without being spotted? Uh oh, he's got rope ladders to climb and hidden switches to find - it's going to be tough. But he's gonna need those weapons bad as he faces off with enemies like the the crazed Coach, and the scary Switchblade Sam. On this late-night escapade, bees, bulldogs, birds, frogs and even bunnies will be a menace to Dennis. Finding Joey, Margaret and Mr. Wilson's coin collection will be an adventure more harrowing than a garden full of cheek pinchers - and you know what Mr. Wilson says, \"that's no g. d. (gosh darn) joke!\"", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_the_Menace_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1672\n"}
