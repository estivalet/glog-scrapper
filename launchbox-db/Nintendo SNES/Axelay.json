{"name": "Axelay", "overview": "KISS YOUR AXELAY GOOD-BYE. You're stewed. Even though you've got the Axelay prototype combat stratafighter with the most sophisticated weaponry in the Illis solar system, the 3-D graphics and perspectives are so realistically shocking that you'll probably freak out and bury the ship in an asteroid. Nevertheless, you're the only remaining hope for a cluster of worlds bonded by one common goal - to suppress the ruthless onslaught brought forth by the Armada of Annihilation in a six level galactic blitzkrieg. The planets of the Illis solar system combined their technology to create a defense force like no other by engineering the D-117B, code name: Axelay. A fighter so advanced and costly; only one could be built.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 11, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axelay", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anU87SulTC4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1521\n"}
