{"name": "Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu: Basic Ban '98", "overview": "Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu Basic '98 (\"Live Commentary Powerful Pro Baseball Basic '98\") is the last in Konami's Power Pro Yakyuu series to be released on the Super Famicom, where the series originated. The game is another annual iteration on Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3, first released in 1996, that saw regular roster updates until 1998. Those iterations also include '96 Kaimaku Han ('96 Opener Edition) and '97-Haru ('97 Spring), both reflecting the new rosters of those time periods. The '98 Basic version also strips out the game's trademark \"Success Mode\", where the player creates their own athlete and has them succeed in the Nippon Professional Baseball league.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 19, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73659\n"}
