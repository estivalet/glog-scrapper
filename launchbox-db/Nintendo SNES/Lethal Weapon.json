{"name": "Lethal Weapon", "overview": "You know what it's all about. That's right. The crazy cop and his almost crazy partner are back to do the city a world of good. As Martin Riggs or Rogar Murtaugh, you've got a lot to decide - like how you're gonna outwit and outdo the major outlaws of L.A. It doesn't get rougher or tougher than the streets of Los Angeles, where you'll take on drug smugglers, terrorists, The Organization and a hostage situation at a shopping mall. Which of these four mission will you tackle first? One thing's for sure, they'll all be tricky ...and deadly. How much of your life and your future are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh? Choose the best man for each mission. Remember, you'll need muscle and wits, so choose wisely. If you're sharp enough and quick enough, you may have time to catch your breath before you begin your final task for the Internal Affairs Department. This time, you'll be tracking down a corrupt police officer; one who knows how you move! So get moving...and do it carefully!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VMRVmo8k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1687\n"}
