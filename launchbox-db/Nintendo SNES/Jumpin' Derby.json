{"name": "Jumpin' Derby", "overview": "Jumpin' Derby is a horse racing simulation game for the Super Famicom. Unlike many games of its genre, it focuses more on the racing itself rather the gambling and management aspects of the sport which are more prominent in series like Derby Stallion or Thoroughbred Breeder. Players still raise their racehorses, but also take an active role in the races themselves which take place in various locations both common and uncommon to horse racing, such as a beach or the Great Wall of China. There are also parts of the races where the player must leap over obstacles, meaning the player must focus on developing the horse's jumping and running strength.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KID Corp.", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73660\n"}
