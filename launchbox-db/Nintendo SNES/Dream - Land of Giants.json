{"name": "Dream: Land of Giants", "overview": "Project Dream was planned to be Rare's most ambitious game for SNES, pushing their techniques of pre-rendered 3D imagery to the furthest boundaries imaginable. In Dream: Land of Giants, you played as a boy named Edson on a quest to help his friend Madeleine from nasty pirates under the command of Captain Blackeye. The idea was heavily inspired by both Western point-n-click adventures, and japanese Role-Playing games with the intention of delivering a character-driven ludonarrative. Over time, the project encountered several complications including the arrival of the Nintendo 64. Eventually the project evolved into what is known as Banjo-Kazooie and some resources -- such as the music -- are within the game's data.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rare", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Dream", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w72kj20YNA0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121961\n"}
