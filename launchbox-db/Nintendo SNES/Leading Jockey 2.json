{"name": "Leading Jockey 2", "overview": "Leading Jockey 2 is a horse racing game for the Super Famicom and the sequel to 1994's Leading Jockey. As with its predecessor, the game is more concerned with the actual racing aspect of the sport than the simulation/gambling aspects that take the forefront in franchises like Derby Stallion or Thoroughbred Breeder. Leading Jockey 2 is the final game in the Leading Jockey series to be released on the Super Famicom. Its two sequels, Leading Jockey '99 and Leading Jockey Highbred, are Sony PlayStation exclusives.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carrozzeria", "publishers": "Carrozzeria", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=qP0oyz-paDA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81749\n"}
