{"name": "Rally: The Final Round of the World Rally Championship", "overview": "Rally: The Final Round of the World Rally Championship is a first-person racing game, with a view from the center of the interior of the car. You have to avoid bales and signs, swinging wildly from side to side. The game looks very much like it is complete, although the difficulty level is really high since you do not have a lot of time to react to obstacles. There are a total of 12 courses, with a championship mode that combines them all. There are official car brands in this game, so you can choose from manufacturers like Ford and Toyota. This game is endorsed by the RAC Rally, a major rally race in the United Kingdom. For sponsorship reasons, it was called the Network Q Rally when this game was made (Network Q is a used car dealership network in the UK). There was a DOS game of the same name, with the same layout for courses, but the game is completely different (it is a 3D, behind-the-car racer). Despite being officially licensed by the Network Q Rally, the courses are not based on real world courses. The game was rated by the ESRB, with a rating of E, showing that it was very close to being released.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JVC", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51474\n"}
