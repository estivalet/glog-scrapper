{"name": "Super Mario World: The Secret of the 7 Golden Statues", "overview": "A hack I have been working on over the course of last September. Story: Mario and Luigi were heading back to Peach's Castle after another one of their amazing adventures, however as soon as they walk in, Peach sends them out on another mission to collect the 7 Golden Statues which Bowser had stolen from her not long ago. Where did they come from? And what's so bad about Bowser stealing some statues? Play and find out! Even when the game ends, there's more to do! Features: -A few new animations -Ground Pounding -New Powerups -Custom Enemies -Custom Music -Custom Bosses -Item System (like SMB3/NSMBW) -Pause Menu -An Original Mario-like Story And much much more! Known bug: -When using the Ice Flower I have made Mario/Luigi revert to their normal colors on the Overworld because for some reason they are transparent when they have that power while on the Overworld.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 11, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "mario90", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esgX30Nf654", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164299\n"}
