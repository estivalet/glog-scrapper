{"name": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken", "overview": "In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself. One of the earliest titles based on the anime series Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, this is a role-playing game with somewhat simplified mechanics and navigation system reminiscent of Japanese adventures. Combat is turn-based and is viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called \"stands\", super-powerful creatures they can summon during fights. Before each fight, the player has to choose one of five available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands in the battle. Equipment and items can be bought in stores.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 5, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cobra Team", "publishers": "Cobra Team", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24164\n"}
