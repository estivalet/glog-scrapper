{"name": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho", "overview": "Yu Yu Hakusho is a Super Famicom game based on the horror-themed manga and anime about a belligerent young man who dies unexpectedly from being hit by a car and is revived as a \"spirit detective\" by the rulers of the afterlife, and it becomes his job to investigate ghostly matters in the mortal world. The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a \"free\" mode against opponents of their choice. Though they have identical names, this particular Yu Yu Hakusho is not to be confused with the 1993 Game Boy Yu Yu Hakusho game, nor the 1994 3DO Yu Yu Hakusho game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 22, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24990\n"}
