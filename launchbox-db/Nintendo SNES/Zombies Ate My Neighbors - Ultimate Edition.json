{"name": "Zombies Ate My Neighbors: Ultimate Edition", "overview": "A complete level hack of the classic game with 55 new levels in total. In Zombies Ate My Neighbors, the player takes the role of a male or female protagonist (Zeke or Julia), fighting vampires, mummies, zombies, and other horrifying creatures. The goal is to destroy these monsters, survive the all new 50+ levels (not including secret ones), and rescue the neighbors that have survived the onslaught. There is a defined number of neighbors who can be saved on every level. When they are all rescued, an \"Exit\" door opens, and the player advances to the next level.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 3, 2005", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank Maggiore", "publishers": "", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jns0p2B2Ir4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133780\n"}
