{"name": "Total Football", "overview": "Total Football is an unreleased soccer game developed by Domark and it was going to be published by Acclaim. They released another soccer game called Champions World Class Soccer, but it is completely unrelated to this game. Total Soccer was commercially released on Megadrive (Genesis) and Amiga. The game was featured in the October 1995 issue of the Spanish magazine, Super Juegos. It must have been fairly close to release to have been sent to magazines for review.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Domark", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126604\n"}
