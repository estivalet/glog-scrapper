{"name": "Super Metroid and A Link to the Past Crossover Randomizer", "overview": "The Super Metroid and A Link to the Past Crossover Randomizer is an item randomizer that combines Super Metroid and A Link to the Past into one experience and shuffles all the items and spreads the out in random locations in any of the games. Travel between the games is possible through the use of four cross-game portals spread out in the games in certain doors and entrances. The game starts out in Super Metroid right after Samus' ship has landed on Zebes, and from this point there's the option to head further down into Super Metroid, or head to the first available cross-game portal. This portal is found in the door that normally would head to the Crateria Map Station, but this will instead take you outside the fortune teller's house south of Link's house in Hyrule. These are the four cross-game portals in the game: \u2022 Lake Hylia Fortune Teller \u21d4 Crateria Map Room \u2022 Back of Old Man Cave \u21d4 Norfair Map Room \u2022 Dark World Ice Rod Right \u21d4 Maridia Missile Refill \u2022 Misery Mire Right Shed \u21d4 Golden Torizo Energy Refill The goal is to defeat both Mother Brain in Super Metroid and Ganon in A Link to the Past, and after defeating the second final boss it is possible to end the game and reach the credits. After defeating the first final boss you will still retain access to the game where you killed the boss, in case there are some items left to be found to complete the other game. Being familiar with the original A Link to the Past and Super Metroid is a great benefit for playing this randomizer.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151436\n"}
