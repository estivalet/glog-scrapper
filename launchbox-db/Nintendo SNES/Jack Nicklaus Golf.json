{"name": "Jack Nicklaus Golf", "overview": "The biggest name in golf brings you the most realistic and feature-backed golf simulation ever! Play eighteen holes on two of Jack Nicklaus' favorite courses or design an unlimited number of courses to play. One to four players can compete on beginner and expert levels, choosing between Skins Play and the very competitive Stroke Play. You control every detail of the action: read the break of the green for your approach shots; play a long iron out of the fairway bunkers; chip or putt it in from the fringe; practice your short game on the green - or just hit a bucket of balls out on the driving range. The password feature even lets your take a break at the turn. If you're ready to play against the best, Jack Nicklaus is your man - and JACK NICKLAUS GOLF is your game!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "Tradewest", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3595\n"}
