{"name": "Shijou Saikyou League Serie A: Ace Striker", "overview": "Shij\u014d Saiky\u014d League Serie A: Ace Striker is a 1995 Japan-exclusive football video game for the Super Famicom. Ace Striker was licensed by Italian Football League and AIC (Associazione Italiana Calciatori) featuring all clubs and footballers from the Italian Serie A (Season 1994\u201395). The football players are drawn in the \"deformed\" anime style. There's no different formations to choose from, but all the players (except the goalkeeper) can be positioned anywhere in the field. During a football match, an animated image will appear whenever a goal is scored. One of the particularities or flaws of this soccer game is that during the penalty shoot-out, the goalkeeper can move and jump before the rival player actually kicks the ball.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 31, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio SIGN", "publishers": "TNN", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shij\u014d_Saiky\u014d_League_Serie_A:_Ace_Striker", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYhvFlM1E98", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81176\n"}
