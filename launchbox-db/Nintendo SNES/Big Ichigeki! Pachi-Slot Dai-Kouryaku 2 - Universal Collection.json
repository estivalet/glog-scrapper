{"name": "Big Ichigeki! Pachi-Slot Dai-Kouryaku 2: Universal Collection", "overview": "Big Ichigeki! Pachi-Slot Daikouryaku 2: Universal Collection (\"Big Blow! Great Pachi-Slot Tips 2: Universal Collection\") is a pachi-slots game for the Super Famicom and the follow-up to 1994's Big Ichigeki! Pachi-Slot Daikouryaku. It was developed by frequent pachi-slot game developer Syscom and the publishing giant Ask Kodansha. Like its predecessor, it offers players the choice to play on a list of virtual slot machines that correspond to real-life equivalents, the idea being that the player can practice the machine in a risk-free environment and learn its quirks before taking on the real deal. As the title suggests, Big Ichigeki! 2 exclusively features thirteen machines from pachi-slots manufacturer Universal.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Syscom Entertainment Inc.", "publishers": "ASK", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50884\n"}
