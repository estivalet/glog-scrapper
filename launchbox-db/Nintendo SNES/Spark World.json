{"name": "Spark World", "overview": "Spark World is a maze action game structurally similar to Bomberman where the protagonists are anthropomorphized cop cars fighting other sentient cars in a series of themed mazes. It was released exclusively in Japan in 1995. The goal of each stage is to defeat all the other opponents, though focusing on collecting power-ups is also important to overpower each stage's foes. Depending on the enemy vehicle type, they also have innate powers that the player does not. The player eventually faces a boss after a certain number of battle stages in each zone. The game also features a multiplayer Battle mode, which provides a number of customization and stage options.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 26, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ITC, Inc.", "publishers": "Den'Z", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbECFtg0lbc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81174\n"}
