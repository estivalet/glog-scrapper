{"name": "Saturday Night Slam Masters", "overview": "It's Saturday night and the Slam Masters have arrived! Ten of the biggest and beefiest wrestlers ever to step into the ring have gathered for one bone-crushing, back-breaking tournament where there are NO RULES! Step into the ring and get ready for no-holds barred wrestling as you bounce your opponents off the ropes and clothesline the fools! Or dare them to take the fight outside the ring where brawls with tables, chairs and bottles are all part of the action. And just when you think you've got enough muscle, grab a multi-player adapter and try out the four player Battle Royal where only the ultimate Slam Master will survive.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3087\n"}
