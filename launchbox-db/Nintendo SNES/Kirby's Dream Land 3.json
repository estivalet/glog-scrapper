{"name": "Kirby's Dream Land 3", "overview": "Dream Land's in trouble...AGAIN! Kirby's back for more action in the latest chapter of the Dream Land saga. This time, though, Kirby has more help than he knows what to do with. In addition to his old pals Rick the hamster, Coo the owl and Kine the fish, there are three new friends to assist Kirby (not to mention Gooey, his blobby little sidekick). With all those friends, two-player simultaneous play and many other helpful surprises, Kirby should have no trouble saving Dream Land again, right? Not if King Dedede has anything to say about it!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land_3", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlPlxkYSykY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3048\n"}
