{"name": "Mini Yonku Shining Scorpion: Let's & Go!!", "overview": "Mini Yonku Shining Scorpion: Let's & Go!! is a racing game that uses a slanted top-down view of the various cars as they drive around a series of tracks. The cars are Mini Yonku, a brand of toy car produced by Tamiya Corporation. These cars are usually battery-powered and are greatly scaled down versions of real vehicles. Shining Scorpion is the first Super Famicom game to use the license, but the third to appear on a Nintendo console. The game specifically uses the Let's & Go! license, a manga written with the Mini Yonku toyline in mind. This serial manga features two brothers, Retsu and Go, who get involved in the world of Mini Yonku racing when the inventor Dr. Tsuchiya gives them two powerful prototype models.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "Ascii Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOviOp2d7dY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32729\n"}
