{"name": "WakuWaku Ski Wonder Spur", "overview": "WakuWaku Ski Wonder Spur (\"WakuWaku\" is onomatopoeia that indicates excitement) is a competitive Mode 7 racing game that revolves around skiing. The game is structurally similar to Super Mario Kart: the player character and up to seven opponents compete across a series of distinctly-themed cups with three courses apiece and can acquire power-ups to make them faster or attack other opponents to momentarily stun them. The game also has multiplayer options. It features four human characters and four slightly more unusual characters, including a cyborg banana, a sunflower, a robot and a rabbit. All play roughly the same.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 13, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Human Entertainment", "publishers": "Human Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82647\n"}
