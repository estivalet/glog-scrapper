{"name": "Eurit", "overview": "Eurit is an action game that was being developed by Radical Entertainment. It eventually was retooled and released on various 32 bit platforms as Grid Runner. The game is basically a souped up version of childhood games of Tag and Capture the Flag. The game features a split-screen and is an ideal two player game. The story behind the game is that the ruler of the galaxy decides that he will retire. In order to find a suitable replacement, he sets up a tournament where wizards and warriors compete to determine who shall be ruler. Throughout the game, you travel to many worlds across the galaxy to prove your might. There are four characters to chose from at the start of the game. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, based on their speed, spellcasting agility, and magic capacity. Through my playthrough, I used the average character. The gameplay is very addictive, and relatively easy to get into. Basically, one of the characters starts off being \"it\". The person who is it cannot capture flags, so they must chase down the other character and touch them. Once you are not it, you can collect flags necessary to win the stage. Complicating the game is the obstacles you face. To proceed through the level, you basically have to build platforms. There are many levels with enemy creatures that usually require a number of blasts with your gun to kill. Speed tiles send you running really quickly, which can either make you quickly escape your foe, or send you far away from him. Probably the most compelling gameplay feature for experts is the magic system. Before each level, you learn a new magic spell. Some spells are mundane, like destroying a platform, but others can devastate your opponent, like the spell that causes all the creatures in the level to attack your opponent. Power-up balls throughout the level allow you to charge your magic meter. The music is pretty typical \"sci-fi game\" fare, comparable to games like Blackthorne, B.O.B., and The Lost Vikings. The sound effects are somewhat muted, though the voice that tells you \"player 1 is now it\" is really well done. The graphics aren't anything too special, but they do the job.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Radical Entertainment", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72730\n"}
