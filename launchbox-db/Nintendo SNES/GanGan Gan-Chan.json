The star-shaped hero GanChan has to rescue a number of creatures lost across grid-like stages while avoiding an ever-changing roster of enemies. Magifact is credited on the title screen as the publisher of the game, but the credits makes it clear that the programming and design were handled by the obscure group Team Mental Care.
