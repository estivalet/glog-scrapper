{"name": "Frogger", "overview": "Why did the frog cross the road? Certainly not the be splattered by high-speed traffic, raging rivers, hungry alligators, slithering snakes, and crazy crocodiles! In Frogger, the timeless arcade classic, the goal of the game is simple, to safely maneuver 5 frogs across five lanes of busy traffic, a fast moving river, three lanes of treacherous logs, two lanes of swimming turtles, while avoiding snakes, alligators and crocodiles. Sounds easy? You'll need lots of skill, and a bit of luck, as you hop to victory, while trying not to become a highway statistic by leaving your \"mark\" on the roadway!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 1, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Morning Star Multimedia", "publishers": "Majesco Sales", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqUjTNF1e7g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3450\n"}
