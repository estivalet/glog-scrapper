{"name": "Casper (Absolute Entertainment)", "overview": "Casper is a side-scrolling action adventure game developed by Absolute Entertainment and published outside of Japan by Natsume. Not to be confused with the completely different Japanese game, which was actually developed by Natsume and published by KSS. STRAIGHT FROM HOLLYWOOD TO HAUNT YOUR SUPER NES! It's a \"gh-gh-gh ghost\" right on your Super NES bringing you all the thrills, chills and eyeball-rolling adventures of the hit movie, Casper. Incredible 3-D graphics will keep you screaming from the attic to the basement of Whipstaff Manor. Watch out for Stinkie, Stretch and Fatso. Casper's demented uncles want you to get lost-- literally-- in over 100 rooms. They've turned Kat's dad, the ghost psychiatrist, into a shapeless mass of ectoplasm. Only the Lazarus machine can save him. Find it. Fuel it. Save the day. Casper. It's spook-tacular!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Absolute Entertainment", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2681\n"}
