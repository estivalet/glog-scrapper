{"name": "Untitled Racing Game", "overview": "There is not a whole lot to say about this game. It appears to be a one track demo of a top-down racing game, presumably by Virgin Games. There is a two player split-screen mode already implemented. The controls are smooth, and the music and sound effects are solid. The graphics are ok, but the cars are really squished. As far as I can tell, no finished game ever came from this. There are some fragments of Super Bomberman in the ROM image, which was likely burned onto the EPROMs prior to this demo.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Virgin Games, Ltd.", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157385\n"}
