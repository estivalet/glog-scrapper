{"name": "Super Ninja-Kun", "overview": "A graphically updated version of UPL's Ninja-kun Arcade games from the 1980s, which Jaleco had previously adapted for consoles (as well as creating their own spin-offs, named Ninja Jajamaru-kun). As well as featuring 16-bit graphics the game now also features a story mode, bosses, an upgradable health gauge (the Arcade game only allowed Ninja-kun to take a single hit) and multiple weapon types. Ninja-kun can also create a powerful one-off magic blast by collecting the souls of dead enemies as they float off the screen. The game also includes a two-player cooperative mode.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 5, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28878\n"}
