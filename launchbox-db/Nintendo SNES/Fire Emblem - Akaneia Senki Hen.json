{"name": "Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki Hen", "overview": "A game comprised of four short standalone episodes taking place between the prologue chapters of Shadow Dragon and Chapter 1, Marth Embarks. The goal of the game was to complete each episode while scoring as many points as possible. Points were collected by completing actions such as defeating enemies, opening chests, and visiting villages. Each episode featured one \"lord\" character who also functioned as the item storage, with the map resetting if the lord character was defeated in battle. The gameplay engine was the same used for Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem. Characters from Mystery of the Emblem and Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light made appearances (retaining their original growth rates), as well as some original characters. The episodes were later remade for Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem, where they appear as a bonus feature in Extra Mode. The remade episodes appear with the time limits, voice acting, and convoy feature removed. The story is told using character portraits taken from Shadow Dragon and the main story chapters in New Mystery of the Emblem.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 28, 1997", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "", "developers": "Intelligent Sys.", "publishers": "St. GIGA", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_Mystery_of_the_Emblem#BS_Fire_Emblem", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB7WyK1ziCY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137044\n"}
