{"name": "Super Mario World: Chaos CompleXX", "overview": "Yeah... you might notice from looking at the screenshots that this is not a serious attempt at hacking, it's more of the opposite. It's a garbage hack! This hack is full with glitches, bad colour palettes, annoying and simple level designs, and a lot of message boxes with senseless and funny comments - very bad english included. Play it... and have fun... :D A very special thanks goes to Golden Yoshi 2000, who initially was the first SMW hacker creating a joke hack called \"SMW Minus - Utter Garbage\". This hack here builds up on the idea of his original creation.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85074\n"}
