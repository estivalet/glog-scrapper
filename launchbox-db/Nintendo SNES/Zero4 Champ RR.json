Because the game takes place in the \"near future\" and it was released in the mid-1990s, the game itself is referring the story of the game to the first decade of the 21st century. This game received a sequel in the form of Zero4 Champ RR-Z.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 22, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Media Rings Corporation", "publishers": "Media Rings Corporation", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26595\n"}
