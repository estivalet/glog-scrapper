The game uses large sprites for the batters and focuses a little more on realism than many of its more Arcade-ish peers. It includes a Home Run Derby mode, as well as a pennant race and all-star games. Super Power League was followed by three Super Famicom sequels, and the Power League series is also present on systems like the PC Engine and PC-FX.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 6, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82635\n"}
