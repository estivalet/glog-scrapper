{"name": "Top Gear 2", "overview": "We'll make this quick. You're holding the new, super-accelerated #1 world leader in race games. Its jammed with twice the programming horsepower of the original Top Gear. So you can scream through 64 cities in 16 countries. Twisting. Turning. Jumping. Spinning. And flipping. At speeds over 200 mph. Solo, or head to head. Day or night. Rain or shine. Fog or snow. Plus, if you win enough prize money, you can buy incredible engine, tire, transmission, nitro system and armor upgrades. And you've got new on-screen power-ups to keep you revved to the redline so get your rear in gear. Because there's nothing half-fast about it. For 1 or 2 player simultaneous racing. 8 megs.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Interactive", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdesdP2JKRY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2101\n"}
