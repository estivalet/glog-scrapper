{"name": "Dear Boys", "overview": "Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match. The game features a \"dramatic\" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind. Dear Boys would eventually be followed by a Konami PS2 game based on the same property named Dear Boys: Fast Break!, which was released in 2003. The manga has no exposure outside of Japan, and so neither game would see an international release.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kan's", "publishers": "Yutaka", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51946\n"}
