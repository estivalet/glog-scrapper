{"name": "Excitebike: Bun Bun Mario Battle Stadium", "overview": "Excitebike: Bun Bun Mario Battle Stadium, also known as Mario Excite Bike or just BS Excitebike, is a remake of the original NES game Excitebike. Unlike the original, the human racers have been replaced by Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, Toad, and some of Bowser's Koopa Troopas. The concept of the game was unchanged except for a \"SUPER\" mode where the player has unlimited turbo, as well as the addition of coins. The coins are spread out on the courses and increase top speed.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 11, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi9spOisYZY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26367\n"}
