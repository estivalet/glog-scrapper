{"name": "Super Ryu World 2: Definitive version", "overview": "Sequel to Super Ryu World. (Although this sequel is nowhere near as easy) This game is dedicated to the amazing youtuber/streamer Ryukahr. The game contains 18 exits including the final castle. -Definitive version- This game has a bad reputation due to being \"highly frustrating\" to play for different issues such as low ceilings, janky/hard to understand setups and even laggy sections, however this update attempts to fix all of these for a more enjoyable experience by greatly improving the level design throughout the whole game, deleting 3 levels and all kaizo blocks, vastly lowering the difficulty in general while still being a decent challenge for somewhat experienced kaizo players and even improving the aesthetics in a couple of levels, if you liked the previous version of Super Ryu World 2, this update is definitely worth checking out. It also gets rid of the death counter for compatibility purposes. Without anything else to say, i hope you enjoy!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 23, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aguni_", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114405\n"}
