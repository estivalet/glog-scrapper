{"name": "Bakukyuu Renpatsu!! Super B-Daman", "overview": "Bakukyuu Renpatsu!! Super B-Daman (\"Bomb Ball Rapid-Fire!! Super B-Daman\") is an action/puzzle game and the second game to use the B-Daman license, a toyline based on figurines that can shoot marbles from a stomach recess. The first B-Daman for Super Famicom, Bomberman B-Daman, based its world around Hudson's Bomberman characters (who were also the basis for the first B-Daman toys), but this game uses characters and settings created specifically for the B-Daman brand and various media spin-offs. The player can try three modes: a story mode, that follows some original characters after their universe is mysteriously altered by a magical hooded figure; a puzzle mode, in which the player has to aim their projectile in order to remove every bomb on the screen; and a multiplayer mode.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 19, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amble", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26489\n"}
