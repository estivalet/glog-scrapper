{"name": "Earthbound: Halloween Hack", "overview": "Toby Fox's Halloween Hack, also known as \"Press the B Button, Stupid!\" is an award-winning ROM hack Fan Sequel of the 1995 cult-classic-role-playing-video-game EarthBound. The story starts off several months after the end of EarthBound. An anachronistic Bounty Hunter named Varik (of Brandish fame) is hired by ex-mayor B. H. Pirkle, now campaigning on a law & order platform, to track down a mysterious creature who mutilated and ate a little girl's parents in Twoson. Along the way, he encounters increasingly horrible things as the adventure takes him all the way to Winters. This isn't your average Halloween game, though \u2014 its content is comparable to games like Silent Hill and Yume Nikki. This game also has the added effect of making you depressed as you play. This is easily one of the most disturbing EarthBound hacks to come out... well, ever, really.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 1, 2008", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "tobyfox", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79072\n"}
