{"name": "F-Zero", "overview": "The future of racing is here! F-ZERO, an intergalaxtic Grand Prix, uses machines that weigh more than a ton, reach dash speeds of over 500km/h and hover a mere twelve inches off the ground! Choose from the heroic Captain Falcon, or the suave, Dr. Stuart. Need more choices? Then try the sly alien, Pico or the not-so-honest Samurai Goroh, and race for intergalactic fame and fabulous fortune in the F-ZERO Grand Prix.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 21, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.28", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Zero_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmbzqTG2iTg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10371\n"}
