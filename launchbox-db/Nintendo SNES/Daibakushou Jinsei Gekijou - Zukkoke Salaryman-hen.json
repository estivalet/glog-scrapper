{"name": "Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou: Zukkoke Salaryman-hen", "overview": "Following the likes of Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijou: Ooedo Nikki, where the players were Edo-period peasants, and Daibakushou: Jinsei Gekijou: DokiDoki Seishun Hen, where the players were awkward teenagers, Zukkoke Salaryman Hen has players taking the role of everyday office workers in modern Japan. As with any Game of Life adaptation, the goal is to be the most successful - this is measured by their career trajectory, lovelife and other factors. Players can create and customize their avatar - either male or female, despite the game's name - and roll dice to move around a board. Depending on which space they land on, they will invoke a scene that will benefit or diminish their standings. Some of these random events - like purchasing lottery tickets - are opt-in, though the majority occur whether the player wants them to or not.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Act Japan", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/58332\n"}
