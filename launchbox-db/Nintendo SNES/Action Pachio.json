{"name": "Action Pachio", "overview": "The player takes control of a white Pachio and tries to make his way through all the side-scrolling levels. In between each level is a cut scene that updates the story for the player. Players can collect coins in the game; collecting 100 of them results in an extra life. They are also given a life bar with three different colors (symbolizing how \"healthy\" the character is), a time limit, and a relatively generic score indicator that goes up to 99 million points.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 9, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C-Lab", "publishers": "Coconuts Japan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22591\n"}
