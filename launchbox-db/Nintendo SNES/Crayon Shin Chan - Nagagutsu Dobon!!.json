{"name": "Crayon Shin Chan: Nagagutsu Dobon!!", "overview": "Crayon Shin-Chan: Nagagutsu Dobon!! (\"Crayon Shin-Chan: Galoshes Splash!!\") is a multiplayer action game for the Super Famicom. It is based on the anime Crayon Shin-Chan. The goal of the game is to splash in puddles and drench the opponent(s). The puddles have a few rules depending on their size, and taking advantage of their layout is key to tricking opponents into getting splashed. There are also power-ups and power-downs the players can collect. The game was the thirteenth and final game in Bandai's range of Sufami Turbo games, which were published on specially created carts that Bandai manufactured for less cost than Nintendo's official carts. It therefore requires a special plug-in peripheral to play.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AIM", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76624\n"}
