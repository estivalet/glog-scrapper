{"name": "Battle Cross", "overview": "A competitive racing game with a single-screen top-down perspective similar to RC Pro Am. The game exhibits a comedic element, with racers often encountering unusual objects on the course and comical cutscenes during the intro and post-race celebrations. Rather than motorcycles, the racers use a type of hoverbike that allows them to jump and turn around on the course more effectively. The game supports up to five players and uses a password system for progress.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "A-Max", "publishers": "Imageneer", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Cross_(1994_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18081\n"}
