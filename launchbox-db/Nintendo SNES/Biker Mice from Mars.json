{"name": "Biker Mice from Mars", "overview": "The fish-faced Plutarkians have devastated Mars--the home planet of Throttle, Vinnie and Modo. These three rebel rodents escaped the mayhem and landed in Chicago, only to find that Limburger, the Plutarkian Leader, set Earth as his next target! No \"rescue the kidnapped victim\" No phony plots and no unbelievable story lines -- just hard core racing that'll get your blood pumpin' and make the sweat gush out of your pits! You can play in PRACTICE mode, try the MAIN RACE, or tackle the brutal BATTLE RACE. No \"mission to save the Earth\" Rev up your bike and get ready for some real heavy metal, \"no holds barred\" racing thrills. The cool 3-D perspective adds tension to every turn in the track. You never know what lies ahead of you -- or who is coming up from behind! Use turbo jumps, thundering wheelies and other powerful moves to win prize money. Take your cash to Charley's Race Shop to upgrade your bike and dominate all! And definitely no wimps! Take the role of one of the heroic Biker Mice -- or go the nasty route and pick the big cheese Limburger, the overlubed Greasepit or the diabolical Dr. Karbunkle. They all have different abilities, speeds, and oh yeah... WEAPONS! The streets aren't safe for long...", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biker_Mice_from_Mars_(1994_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77rxFpgd99U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1476\n"}
