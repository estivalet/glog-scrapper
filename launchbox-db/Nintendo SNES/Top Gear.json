{"name": "Top Gear", "overview": "This is it. The race of your life. Head to head. Nose to nose. Flag to flag for the championship of the world. And only your best friend - or your worst enemy - stands in your way as you chase each other around 32 fiendishly tricky racetracks scattered from Paris to Rio. You each choose your car carefully for speed. handling and power. Grab the controls, and punch it down the blacktop. This is awesome split-screen racing at its best, and it takes all your skill, courage and split-second timing to stay on the road, day after day, night after night, past roadblocks, barriers and pit stops. So gear up. Get your motor running. And go for the nitro. There's only room in the winner's circle for one!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM-730F8fkE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2100\n"}
