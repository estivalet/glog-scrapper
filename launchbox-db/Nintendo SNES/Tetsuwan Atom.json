{"name": "Tetsuwan Atom", "overview": "Based on the 1960s popular science fiction animated series and manga originally created by Osamu Tezuka. The player must undertake a series of missions such as exploring a large pyramid, wandering through an eerie haunted house or flying at full speed through the narrow corridors of a space station. Of course, each level is infested with enemies and obstacles to impede Atom's progress, as well as an obligatory end of level's boss. The robot boy has a couple of ways to deal with his enemies though - he can use his fists in close-range combat or charge up his rocket boots to hover around, or release a powerful air dash attack. The game also features a couple of special items for the player to collect, such as Energy Containers, Temporary Invincibility or Small Radios that summon Uran, Atom's young sister, who releases various health items or an extra life when called.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Zamuse", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Atom_(1994_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73242\n"}
