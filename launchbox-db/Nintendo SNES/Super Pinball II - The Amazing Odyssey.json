{"name": "Super Pinball II: The Amazing Odyssey", "overview": "The sequel to the 1994 SNES game Super Pinball: Behind the Mask, though did not join it with a release in North America. The game is, however, entirely in English. The game features three tables: The sci-fi \"Space Sister\", the James Bond-inspired \"The Spy Eyes\", and the circus-themed \"Showtime\". Each table has its own quirks and high scoring zones to discover, such as Space Sister having a second set of paddles higher up the table or Showtime with its own mini-game. The game can be played in Contest mode, which has one or two players (down from the original game's four) compete to earn the highest score possible on a single table, or the Conquest mode in which a single player attempts to beat all three tables - they need to score 100 million points on a table in order to progress to the next.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 17, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KaZe", "publishers": "Meldac", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28879\n"}
