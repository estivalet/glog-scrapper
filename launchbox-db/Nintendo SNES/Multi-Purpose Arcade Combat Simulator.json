{"name": "Multi-Purpose Arcade Combat Simulator", "overview": "The Multi-Purpose Arcade Combat Simulator (or M.A.C.S.), was a shooting simulator developed for the U.S. Army as a cheap way to train shooting skills. It was a bit of a mystery until a couple of years ago when the rifle and and carts became available through Ebay. The game did not have the ability to be played by a controller, a controller hooked up to port 2 is needed to access some parts of the program. The program rates how well you do in many aspects of shooting. There are a few known variants of the programs. For instance, the Moving Target Simulator keeps track of where you are aiming and where you shot so you can see how well you are shooting. The setup used by the military used a 13 inch TV, to give you and idea of what you have to aim at.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50011\n"}
