{"name": "TKO Super Championship Boxing", "overview": "With the most advanced graphics ever created for boxing, the 'sweet science' has never been so real! Check out the action: you've won your first bout, but it was tough! 8 grueling rounds, and now you're dog tired. So it's back to the gym to work on your stamina. Next bout: you're up against this guy who's REALLY FAST! He's not hurting you, but he's building up points with pitty-pat combinations, and you're getting mad! Between rounds, your corner tells you how to get even! They've seen that he drops his left guard, so he's open for a right hook. Next round: BAM! Right hook. He's OUTTA HERE!!! This is SUPER CHAMPIONSHIP BOXING. Non-stop smashin' bashin' knuckle-krunchin' action! Either go one-on-one with a buddy; pick a fight with one of eight powerhouse opponents or go for the whole enchilada - beat 'em all and become the WORLD CHAMP! After just one bout, you will agree that is a major KNOCKOUT !", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 28, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sting", "publishers": "Sofel", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.26", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6020\n"}
