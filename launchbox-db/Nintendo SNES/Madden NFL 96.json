{"name": "Madden NFL 96", "overview": "Madden NFL 96 covers the 95/96 season of the NFL. It was released on various 16-bit platforms in late 1995 and was the last Madden game to be exclusive to that generation. Among its various additions to the Madden NFL template is the inclusion of a \"create-a-player\" mode, which allows players to create their own in-game avatars and add them to the teams of their choice. Players also have the option of \"classic teams\", which bring back various famous line-ups from different points in the NFL's history between 1960 and 1986 and can be unlocked by winning the Super Bowl as that particular team's 1995 incarnation.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Tiburon Entertainment", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_%2796", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTjqy1zt4BA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/275\n"}
