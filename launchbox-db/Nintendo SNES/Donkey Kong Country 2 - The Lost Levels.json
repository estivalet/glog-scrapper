{"name": "Donkey Kong Country 2: The Lost Levels", "overview": "There are very few romhacks from the Donkey Kong Country franchise, given the small amount of tools available and the limitation of these. Also, use of the editors are quite complex. Despite the difficulty, a Brazilian romhacker, Lucas Rangel, did an exquisite job in creating this hack. The game is completely redesigned, all stages have been modified, graphics have significant improvements, with new colors, shadows, resulting in beautiful environments that should not be anything for the original game. In addition, all bonuses have changed, both in the challenges themselves and in the locations to reach them. The same happened with the DK coins, which are located in different places. The difficulty of the game is well balanced, following the same formula of the original in which the level of difficulty gradually increases. In the case of romhack, this is an important aspect, as there are many hacks in which the difficulty is not balanced, being practically impossible to progress in the game. The gameplay has not undergone any changes, which is excellent, so the gameplay of the original game is perfect. The soundtrack is the same as the original game, however, their order has been changed, changing according to the phases, combined with the new setting of each one. For fans, this is the opportunity to yearn and test their skills in the new stages. Without a doubt, this is the best romhack of Donkey Kong Country 2.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 19, 2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lucas Rangel", "publishers": "Lucas Rangel", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115974\n"}
