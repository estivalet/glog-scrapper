Based on the fictional character by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the game was slated for a 1994 release date alongside versions for the Game Boy and Sega Game Gear. It was designed as \u201cmulti-level side-scrolling action game,\u201d where Tarzan must overcome obstacles to rescue Jane from the African jungle. While the game may lack originality in its design, the visuals stand out. Jim Bradrick, an animator best known for his work at Humongous Entertainment, was hired on as director for the animation. For a SNES game from 1993 the animation is incredibly smooth, almost as if it was rotoscoped.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Manley & Associates, Inc.", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Z8psjOq_U-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121687\n"}
