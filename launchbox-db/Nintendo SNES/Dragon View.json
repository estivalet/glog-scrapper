{"name": "Dragon View", "overview": "Warrior! Open your eyes! This is the future of gaming! Look, before you leap, this isn't some corny collection of cardboard dungeons and dragons. It's a brilliant new vision of RPG action adventure, with real-time 16 meg 3D scrolling like you've never seen. Plus an incredible hero's-eye-view of the danger. Through caves of fire and meadows of ice, against brutal demons and unforeseen evils, all the way to a showdown you'll never forget, bring your bow, your sword, your magic. And don't blink - or you're doomed!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 26, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kotobuki System", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_View", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6ILSlcEM6E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1527\n"}
