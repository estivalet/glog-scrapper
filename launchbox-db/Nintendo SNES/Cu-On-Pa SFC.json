{"name": "Cu-On-Pa SFC", "overview": "Cu-On-Pa is a puzzle game in which the player takes control of a cube, the object being to roll this cube over squares of a particular color. If the top face of the cube matches the colour of the square, it is collected; claim enough squares to move onto the next level. Essentially, this is a Super Famicom port of the 1995 PC game Endorfun - in fact, Cu-On-Pa is licensed from Endorfun. Cu-On-Pa features none of the new-age stylings of the earlier game, instead opting for a more traditional puzzle game aesthetic. This version offers a couple of new features over Endorfun: there is an Easy Mode, which reduces the available colors from six down to three; and there is also a Puzzle Mode which gives the player predefined boards to solve, and a limited number of moves to do so.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorfun", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz2LXD6U7ZQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3375\n"}
