{"name": "RoboCop Versus The Terminator", "overview": "As Robocop--both the unwitting agent of humankind's destruction and its last possible champion--you must travel across time into a savage future ruled by the mechanical forces of Skynet. From war-torn modern Detroit, to the mean streets of Delta City, and on to the bone-strewn bunkers of post-apocalypse L.A., you'll face attack from every angle, every moment. An unwavering army of Terminators, robotic dogs, spiders, Endoskeletons and a relentless arsenal of automated weapons await you in this veritable nightmare on earth. To destroy this enemy, free its hostages and finally pierce the dark heart of a brutal computer will take something more powerful than plasma rifles and laser guns: the human mind that still burns within you.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interplay", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop_Versus_The_Terminator", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxKR4ONe4bQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2480\n"}
