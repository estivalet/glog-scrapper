{"name": "Super Trump Collection", "overview": "Super Trump Collection is a compilation featuring seven different card games from publisher Bottom Up. It is the first game in their Trump Collection series, which would later make its way onto various other systems. The series also saw one other game for the Super Famicom: Super Trump Collection 2. The card games include Poker, Blackjack, Crazy Eights, Shichi Narabe (Sevens) and a Memory Match game, as well as two others. Poker and Blackjack are both presented as their \"video\" incarnations often seen in casinos, and the player can bet a configurable amount of money on the result before starting. If they win a payout, they have the option of playing a double-or-nothing mini-game to increase their winnings (or potentially lose them). For Poker, the double-or-nothing game involves betting high or low on the next card, while Blackjack has the player guess red or black for the next card.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bottom Up", "publishers": "Bottom Up", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82834\n"}
