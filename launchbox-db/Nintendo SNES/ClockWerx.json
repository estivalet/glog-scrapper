{"name": "ClockWerx", "overview": "The goal of the game is to navigate a screen full of nodes to reach a specific point. Along the way are various traps that have a fixed patrol around the screen. The player walks clockwise or anti-clockwise around each node, and can move to another at the moment when their head is touching the node in question. They can also switch direction. By using these two abilities, the player can move across each screen, carefully avoiding obstacles and reaching the end.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 8, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Axes Art Amuse", "publishers": "Tokuma Shoten", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51931\n"}
