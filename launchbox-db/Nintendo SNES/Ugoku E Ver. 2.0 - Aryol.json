{"name": "Ugoku E Ver. 2.0: Aryol", "overview": "Ugoku E Ver. 2.0: Aryol (\"Ugoku\" means \"to move\") is a 1994 Super Famicom puzzle game published by Altron and developed by an unknown contract developer. It is a spiritual sequel to Altron's Olivia's Mystery, released earlier the same year. Like that game, Aryol features an ongoing story that is occasionally interrupted with a jigsaw puzzle the player must solve to continue the plot. The puzzle that the player must construct is constantly in motion, which can help and disorient the player in equal measure. In addition, there are \"fake\" pieces that will cause the puzzle to break apart if added in lieu of the real pieces. The story of Aryol involves a mysterious green-clad thief and his female partner, who is dressed in a French policeman's outfit, as they attempt to rob banks to pay for her flying career. The plot heavily features an airship known as the Aryol, which lends its name to the game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 5, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Altron", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45929\n"}
