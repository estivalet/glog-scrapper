{"name": "Pachiokun Special 3", "overview": "Pachiokun Special 3 is a pachinko game in Coconuts Japan and the fourth Pachiokun game for the Super Famicom, after Action Pachio and the first two Pachiokun Specials. The \"Special\" in the title was added for Super Famicom entries. It would also be the last Pachiokun game for the system. Unlike its predecessors, each of which presented a new setting, Pachiokun Special 3 instead revisits the first four Pachiokun games for NES: Pachiokun, Pachiokun 2, Pachiokun 3 and Pachiokun 4. All four games have been recreated with 16-bit graphics, and each begins with a video message to Pachiokun that fills him on the plot for that particular entry. The gameplay remains identical: play various pachinko machines to reach a target amount of winnings to progress the plot.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marionette", "publishers": "Coconuts Japan", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88592\n"}
