{"name": "Jelly Boy 2", "overview": "This is a sequel to the game SmartBall which is known in Japan as Jerry Boy. This game was supposed to be released by Sony Music Entertainment in September 1994 for the Super Famicom. Jelly Boy 2 is a largely complete action / platform game that improves on its predecessor in pretty much every way. Like the original Jerry Boy - SmartBall in the US - a wizard transforms the main character Marine into a jelly creature. This time, the wizard also transforms his four friends and their dog as well. At first, you can choose between five different stages to save all your friends. Each stage has five levels. Then you gain access to three other stages with considerably ramped up difficulty. This game is similar to Donkey Kong Country 2, in that there are secret rooms that you must find to get the ultimate ending. The game was developed by Game Freak which is widely known today for its Pok\u00e9mon franchise. Satoshi Tajiri was the supervisor, Ken Sugimori the character designer, and Yoshinori Sunahara the music composer.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 1, 2019", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Freak", "publishers": "Classic Game Builder", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29130\n"}
