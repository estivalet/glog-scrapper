{"name": "Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile", "overview": "Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile (roughly \"Breakthrough Bullet: Final Car Fight: Battle Mobile\") is a vehicular combat game from System Sacom, which was released on the Super Famicom in Japan only. The story concerns a newlywed couple who are accosted by Mad Max-esque highway bandits, leading to the death of the wife. The aggrieved husband spends the following year building a high-tech combat vehicle out of a sports car and is determined to make the bandits pay. The game plays like a mix of a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up and a racing game, where the best means of removing on-screen enemies is by charging into them. Out-of-reach enemies, like helicopters, can be taken down with missiles instead.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 25, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "System Sacom", "publishers": "System Sacom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekitotsu_Dangan_Jid%C5%8Dsha_Kessen:_Battle_Mobile", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73341\n"}
