{"name": "SD Gundam Gaiden 2: Entaku no Kishi", "overview": "SD Gundam Gaiden 2: Entaku no Kishi is a RPG based on the SD Gundam sub-franchise of the famous anime and toyline series of Gundam. It is the sequel to the Super Famicom game SD Gundam Gaiden: Knight Gundam Monogatari: Ooinaru Isan, which is itself a sequel to the Famicom game SD Gundam Gaiden: Knight Gundam Monogatari. As with those games, the player assumes the role of an anthropomorphized version of the Knight Gundam in a fantasy kingdom where monsters and evil anthropomorphized Gundam run amok. The SD Gundam Gaiden games are essentially Dragon Quest clones, down to its first-person turn-based combat system, but with Gundams. This is also the case for the SD Gundam: Knight Gundam manga that the games are based on.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Yutaka", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26615\n"}
