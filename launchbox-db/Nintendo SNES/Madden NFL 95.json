{"name": "Madden NFL 95", "overview": "Last week our #1 wideout was lost for the season. This week our all world rookie steps in-with off the planet speed but no hands. Under a minute & down by seven from our own 45, we go with the no huddle against the Bears' Grizzly Attack. With the boys up front in gap protection, and passing windows off, I check the tight end. He's blanketed by the zone, but I see the rookie down the sideline. I make the read, fire a bullet and the kid actually hauls it in, straight arms the corner and high steps down the sideline for six. Sweet. I peel myself off the turf in time to catch him cabbage patching through the paint. Then I look to the sidelines and the man says go for two - and the win. - Any Madden 95 QB", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visual Concepts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_%2795", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr1vkwP-pJI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3628\n"}
