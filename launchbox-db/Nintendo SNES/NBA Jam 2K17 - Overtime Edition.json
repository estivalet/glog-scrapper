{"name": "NBA Jam 2K17: Overtime Edition", "overview": "This romhack takes concepts learned and developed within eskayelle\u2019s NBA Jam TE - Double Z Mod and extends them to EMiller518\u2019s awesome 2K17 mod, the purpose being to develop a proof-in-concept whereby a template game could be created to apply annual roster updates against. To achieve this, this romhack expands and improves upon the great work accomplished in the original 2K17 romhack by adding the following: \u2022 Applies the option menu bugfix issued by Mattrizzle to the NLSC Forum in January 2017. \u2022 Applies eskayelle\u2019s injury bugfix. \u2022 Applies phonymike\u2019s Grand Champions bugfix. \u2022 Reformats certain texts in the attract mode screens. \u2022 Allows for input of 2 Konami codes for accessing expanded rosters. \u2022 Updates logos for select teams, including Toronto, Memphis, and NOLA. \u2022 Modifies the playing order of the teams, such that you now battle from worst to first, based on the 2015-16 season. \u2022 Removes all visual references to the Seattle Supersonics, New Jersey Nets, and Washington Bullets. OKC, Brooklyn, and the Wizards are here! \u2022 Swaps in new secret characters to add to the game\u2019s playability. \u2022 Adds sound clips for the Thunder and the Wizards! Please feel free to browse the readme for more info, including secret player initials/button combinations, and cheat codes. Huge thanks to phonymike for all his guidance and ASM assistance on both the Double Z Mod and NBA Jam 2K17 - OT Edition. Thanks as well to Wake for prepping additional sound clips via Soundforge and Audacity, plus DarkSamus993 and gauveldt for sound guidance that helped \u201ccrack the code\u201d. Hat tips to optiroc and Bregalad for additional SNES sound concepts.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 5, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "eskayelle", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126204\n"}
