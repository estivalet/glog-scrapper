{"name": "SimAnt: The Electronic Ant Colony", "overview": "Ants. You've shared your food, your home and your planet with them. You've stepped on them, sprayed them, cursed them and bombed them. Now you can be them! Experience life as an ant: fight for queen and colony, face hungry spiders and menacing hordes of enemy ants, eat yummy caterpillars, and drive those yucky humans out of the house! Based on real ants, SimAnt has the depth of play and serious gaming challenge to really drive you buggy. SimAnt is about the closest you'll get to being an ant without growing more legs, removing your brain and living in a hole in the ground.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tomcat System", "publishers": "Maxis Software", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5576\n"}
