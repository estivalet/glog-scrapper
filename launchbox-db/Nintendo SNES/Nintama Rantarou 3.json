{"name": "Nintama Rantarou 3", "overview": "Nintama Rantarou 3 (\"Ninja Boy Rantarou 3\") is an action-platforming game for the Super Famicom and the fifth game on the system to use the Nintama Rantarou license, based on a comedic children's manga and anime about a trio of ninja cadets. As with its predecessors, the game balances 2D platforming sections that relies on the trio's ninja skills with cutscenes and mini-games. The game breaks up the game into sequences which the player can tackle in a semi-loose order. The grid of possible skits and stages to visit is limited at first, and more become available as others are completed.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Culture Brain", "publishers": "Culture Brain", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81458\n"}
