{"name": "CB Chara Wars: Ushinawareta Gag", "overview": "CB Chara Wars: Ushinawareta Gag is an action game that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The \"CB\" in the title refers to the term \"chibi\", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles. CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 28, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Almanic", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40312\n"}
