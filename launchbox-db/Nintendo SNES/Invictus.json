{"name": "Invictus", "overview": "Invictus is a chocolate kaizo hack with a touch of vanilla charm that will challenge even the most experienced players. It aims to be fun, whilst remaining difficult albeit fair. It took the entirety of my free time over the course of nine months to learn and build. Good luck, and enjoy! This hack features: - 20 individual, challenging levels with instant retry - An impressive coded-from-scratch final boss (courtesy of Kaizoman/Thomas) - A fine assortment of custom assets, including a bangin' soundtrack - NO hidden blocks. Studies claim fun has increased by 200%! - Loads of secrets for those who explore a little deeper... Special thanks to Nexus15, Freakin_HA, HmWhyNot, ChrisG___, White_Moth, Hiro_sofT, DanTheVP, LadiesMan217 and Kaizoman for all of their assistance, patience and hard work in helping me to make this hack a reality. This game wouldn't exist without them.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 3, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "JUZCOOK", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114402\n"}
