{"name": "Super Birdie Rush", "overview": "Super Birdie Rush is a top-down golf game released exclusively in Japan and the sequel to Golf Club: Birdie Rush. Super Birdie Rush was either developed by Data East or commissioned by them, and they also published the game. The player can select between Stroke Play, Match Play and Tournament, each of which takes progressively more time to complete. The game takes advantage of Mode 7 when presenting an overhead view of each hole before the player can tee off. It otherwise takes the common video game golf route of having the player hit the button to stop a moving gauge in order to determine how much power is behind the swing.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 6, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East Corporation", "publishers": "Data East Corporation", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82558\n"}
