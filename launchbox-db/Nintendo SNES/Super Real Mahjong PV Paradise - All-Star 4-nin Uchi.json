{"name": "Super Real Mahjong PV Paradise: All-Star 4-nin Uchi", "overview": "All-Star 4-nin Uchi is a version of Super Real Mahjong PV that focuses on four-player mahjong game (as in professional competitions, with North, East, West, and South sides) rather than one-on-one strip mahjong. Instead of only three female opponents the game has nine, including characters from previous entries in the series. Players can choose between a tournament and a team mode, in which three teams made of three girls each compete against each other. Also included is an extensive mini-game mode: each of the nine girls offers her own mini-game. These games are fairly simple, usually containing only one screen, and range from a jigsaw puzzle to cake-baking and balancing a motorcycle on a log.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SETA Corporation", "publishers": "SETA Corporation", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83871\n"}
