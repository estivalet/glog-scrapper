{"name": "Sound Factory", "overview": "Sound Fantasy was a game planned for release around 1994. An early title for this game was Sound Factory. Sound Fantasy was the creation of Toshio Iwai. A glimpse of the final version of the game came during an exhibition of Iwai's work during the release of Electroplankton for the DS in 2005 (see the article on this exhibition by IGN). There, the box art for the Japanese version of the game was displayed. Electroplankton is no doubt inspired by Sound Fantasy (and the PC game SimTunes). The game was also produced by the late Gunpei Yokoi. During a tribute to Yokoi at an art show in Tokyo in 2010, Iwai played the final version of Sound Fantasy. Also displayed was a promotional poster for the game that gives details on its release date. It says that it would be released in October (presumably 1994) for 6800 yen, and 9800 yen with the mouse included", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82281\n"}
