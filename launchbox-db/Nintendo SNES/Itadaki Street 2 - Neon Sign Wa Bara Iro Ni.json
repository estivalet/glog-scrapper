{"name": "Itadaki Street 2: Neon Sign Wa Bara Iro Ni", "overview": "A multiplayer board game adaptation that plays similarly to Monopoly. Players make their way around the board, buying properties and returning to the start point after passing through four integral points around the board shaped like playing card suits. There are multiple boards to choose from, each of which has a different shape and is increasingly larger and more elaborate than the last.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 26, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Armor Project", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkQ6jJqj1Y0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23283\n"}
