{"name": "Super Momotarou Dentetsu III", "overview": "The fourth game in Hudson's Momotaro Dentetsu series of train simulation board games. It plays similarly to Itadaki Street or Monopoly in that the player has to accrue wealth by purchasing properties and making other business deals that are often dependent on the square they end their turn on. The Momotaro Dentetsu model received a multitude of small tweaks and additions in this fourth entry but otherwise plays identically to its predecessors.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Make", "publishers": "Hudson", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23285\n"}
