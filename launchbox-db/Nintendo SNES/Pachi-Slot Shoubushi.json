{"name": "Pachi-Slot Shoubushi", "overview": "Pachi-Slot Shoubushi (\"Pachi-Slot Gambler\") is a pachi-slot game for the Super Famicom. The game features a number of different pachi-slot machines for the player to peruse, as well as offering two- and four-player mahjong tables as a break of pace. The player selects and names an avatar - male or female - and competes through a series of increasingly more exclusive venues earning as much money as possible. The game is similar to Nichibutsu's earlier Super Nichibutsu Mahjong games in that it features a number of anime women hosting its various modes and the game has a generally lighthearted presentation.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 23, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nichibutsu", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88593\n"}
