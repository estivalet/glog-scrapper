{"name": "Earthbound: The Rat Race", "overview": "This game, which you might think of as EarthBound for girls, is a project that took several years and a lot of work with JHack and Hex Workshop to complete. Most of what I\u2019ve changed is character names and the text, although I\u2019ve also thrown in a few changes in the graphics I hope you\u2019ll find to your liking. There is no \u201cadult\u201d content in this game unless you count a few items I\u2019ve de-censored from Mother 2 that might get a mention on an Internet Movie Data Base parental guide but wouldn\u2019t earn any movie so much as a PG rating (i.e. references to dating, death, and drugs). This was originally a birthday gift for a young relative of mine who is about the same age as the protagonist and even looks a bit like her. While the game story will likely seem rather familiar from EarthBound, I\u2019ve added several twists and put my own spin on things as you\u2019ll see when you play it. While Shigesato Itoi\u2019s affectionate parody of America ca. 1995 has aged remarkably well in the past 16 years, there\u2019s always been room to augment and improve upon some of the story\u2019s themes.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 1, 2011", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Earthbound Cental", "publishers": "EarthBound Central", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://earthboundcentral.com/2011/10/earthbound-hack-the-rat-race/", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iol8-Ug4MRA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162498\n"}
