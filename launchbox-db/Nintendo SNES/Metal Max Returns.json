{"name": "Metal Max Returns", "overview": "Metal Max Returns is a post-apocalyptic turn-based RPG with a heavy emphasis on open-world, non-linear gameplay and vehicle customization. It is the remake of the original 1991 Famicom game, and the third game in the series overall after the 1993 sequel Metal Max 2. The protagonist is a player-named hero who is disowned by his mechanic father after he insists on pursuing his dream to be a monster hunter, a dangerous profession. The player can acquire new party members and create tanks to ride around in, as well as customize the load-out of those tanks. It plays fundamentally the same as the original Famicom game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Crea-Tech", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14324\n"}
