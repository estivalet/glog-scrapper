{"name": "Congo: The Movie: The Secret of Zinj", "overview": "Congo: The Secret of Zinj is an unreleased Super NES game based on the hit 1995 movie. The game was cancelled after a short development turnover and play tests indicating that the game was not good enough for release. Also contributing was the fact that the movie was a bit of a flop.Congo is split into five different types of gameplay. The main levels include a light-gun style shooter, a raft level that is sort of a \"avoid the edges\" maze game, a slide level where the character must jump to avoid spikes and other obstacles, an on-the-rails platform level, and an overhead 2.5D level.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visual Concepts", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS0xM3EyaJw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28689\n"}
