{"name": "Idea No Hi: Day of the Idea", "overview": "A surreal turn-based JRPG with the story and character design from the manga artist Koji Aihara. The protagonist is a player-named boy who escapes from a laboratory after awakening to his psychokinetic powers. His quest takes him across a dystopian world, picking up allies along the way.The game has a few novel ideas, like allowing the protagonist to crossdress (which changes their profile picture) or wear underwear on his head, the latter of which results in people treating him like a pervert, which has a few beneficial side-effects. The protagonist has a \"limit break\" style attack when low on health, and the game has a day/night cycle.Koji Aihara also worked on the 1992 JRPG Maka Maka (also by Office Koukan). His satirical and bizarre touches permeate Idea no Hi as well.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Office Koukan", "publishers": "Shouei System", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73694\n"}
