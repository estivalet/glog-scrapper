{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Fourth Quest", "overview": "In the December of 1996, a follow up to the previous year's Legend of Zelda broadcast streamed into Japanese homes (or at least those lucky enough to shell out for the Satellaview add-on with BS-X game pack and memory card, St. Giga's BS Tuner as well as the monthly Satellite Radio subscription). Dubbed the 'Fourth Quest' by fans, this is basically another remixed version of the NES original. The Legend of Zelda - Fourth Quest is an expanded version of The Legend of Zelda that was released for the Satellaview add-on of the SNES/SFC System in Japan. The gameplay is identical to its predecessor, but the maximum of Rupees was increased to 999 (rather than 255), the overworld was altered, and dungeons were completely different. This game was aired in two versions, Map 1 and Map 2. Map 1 is sometimes referred to as a \"Third Quest\", in reference to The Legend of Zelda's Second Quest, and Map 2 would therefore be a Fourth Quest.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130673\n"}
