{"name": "Grand Poo World 2", "overview": "Grand Poo World 2 is the sequel to one of the hardest Kaizo: Light hacks ever made. This game features challenging levels, custom music, secret paths and unique bosses. Unlike its predecessor, this game features both instant retry and a save block in Yoshi's house so that the player can now keep their midways when turning off their console. The levels of Grand Poo World 2 were designed to emphasize tight platforming and unique design over item tricks involving shells and springs and such. Unfortunately, I am still a jerk; this game features trolls that at times will be funny, at other times cruel. I make no apologies. This hack, like its predecessor, is dedicated to my good friend GrandPooBear. Extra special thanks to Kaizoman, Nexus, Dode, com_poser, DantheVP and Freakin_Ha for all of their efforts helping me make and playtest this beast. I couldn't have done any of this without you all. Good luck, have fun. I hope you enjoy my game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 14, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BARBARIAN [BARB]", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anhKrWAT0Oc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114400\n"}
