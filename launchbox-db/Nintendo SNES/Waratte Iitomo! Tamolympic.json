{"name": "Waratte Iitomo! Tamolympic", "overview": "A party mini-game collection based on the Japanese TV show of the same name. The show was a daily hour-long comedy variety show featuring recurring guests and various skits and interviews, hosted by the shades-wearing comedian Tamori (whose real name is Kazuyoshi Morita). It aired from 1982-2014 and made several longevity records in the process. The game allows for up to four players, but only two players ever play at once: most of the mini-games are based on completing a task within a set time or with a certain amount of precision, so all players don't need to play simultaneously. Instead, the first pair of players will play each mini-game, followed by the second pair (or two-and-one, if the three-player mode was selected). These mini-games have a comedic edge to them and vary from bowling with a snooker cue to a Simon Says game that involves clapping the correct way to certain goofy poses Tamori makes.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Athena", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81916\n"}
