{"name": "Steel Talons", "overview": "The Army has the green Berets. The Navy has their Seals. But for chopper pilots, only the best qualify for the STEEL TALONS. Prove that you've got the right stuff. Annihilate tanks, choppers, missiles, and more! Dogfight jet fighters. Fly between canyon walls close enough to touch. It's gut-check time through 14 combat missions in fog, haze, smoke, and darkness over desert, woodlands, and mountains. Pilot the most advanced chopper taxpayer money can buy. Fire the most destructive weaponry in the air: laser-guided missiles with pinpoint accuracy or the deadly 30mm cannon. But it could be just scrap metal - unless you've got what it takes to be a STEEL TALON.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Panoramic", "publishers": "Left Field Productions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5860\n"}
