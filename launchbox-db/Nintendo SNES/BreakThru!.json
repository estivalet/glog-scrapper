{"name": "BreakThru!", "overview": "BreakThru is a frenetic-paced puzzle that forces you to think fast. The fun starts with a clock and a solid wall of colored bricks. Eliminate the bricks by clicking on two or more neighboring bricks of the same color. Tear down wall after wall through six cities as you race the clock to raise your score. Watch out! Pesky spiders, annoying soda cans and obnoxious boulders are out to make life rough. Knock them out of action with rockets and dynamite before time runs out, so you can break throw h to the next wall.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artech Digital Entertainments", "publishers": "Spectrum Holobyte", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2393\n"}
