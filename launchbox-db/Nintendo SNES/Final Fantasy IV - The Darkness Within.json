{"name": "Final Fantasy IV: The Darkness Within", "overview": "This romhack is a redesign of the original Final Fantasy IV game, focusing mostly on a revamped story and rebalanced gameplay. A lot of development time went into ensuring that the game was challenging and engaging to all playstyles. \u2022 Character and Enemy stat, AI, and drop adjustments. \u2022 Spell lists and learned spell levels have been adjusted for most characters. \u2022 Several spells have had their power/accuracy/elements/cast time adjusted in an effort to make all spells serve a purpose. Some spells removed. Some spells added. \u2022 Summons revamped or altered. \u2022 Several new abilities have been changed/added/re-introduced to the game. \u2022 Equipment overhauled including new accessories which behave like relics from later games. Crow!\u2019s TLD Equipment Screen mod makes the equipment menu far more informational. A Weapon/Armor Chart is also included for viewing items outside of the game. \u2022 Several characters are capable of equipping different weapon types. These weapon types offer differing styles of gameplay intended to allow the player to hybridize certain characters. Different weapons grant different stat bonuses. \u2022 Fat Chocobos no longer require an item to summon. They can be found in most small chocobo forests as well as a few other places. \u2022 Many dialogue and naming changes to coincide with later releases and easier reading. \u2022 Nearly every dialogue box in the game was edited or completely altered.
