{"name": "The Great Battle II: Last Fighter Twin", "overview": "The second game in the Great Battle series for Super Famicom which began with SD Great Battle in 1990. It is also part of the Compati Hero Series, which re-imagines Gundam, Ultraman and Kamen Rider characters as super deformed (SD) versions of relative sizes. This was so the immensely tall Gundam and Ultraman characters could fight alongside human-sized Kamen Rider characters. Last Fighter Twin departs from SD Great Battle's top-down action gameplay with a side-scrolling brawler format.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32977\n"}
