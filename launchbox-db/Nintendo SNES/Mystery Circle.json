{"name": "Mystery Circle", "overview": "Mystery Circle is a puzzle game set in the distant future, with Tetris and Qix overtones throughout. To complete a level, the player must draw around the outline of the falling shapes to erase them, while at the same time trying to stop them from filling the screen. As the player does this, the player's spaceship will constantly experience sudden changes in gravity as the ship goes upside down... and back again! The player can always use a space shuttle to instantly vaporize any block particles in the general vicinity of the ship, but this can only be performed once per game. The game is over when the screen is completely filled with blocks... or if the player completes all 71 levels. Two players can also compete against each other for the highest score.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 4, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wave Corp.", "publishers": "K.
