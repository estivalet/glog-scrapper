{"name": "Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest Reborn", "overview": "As many of you know Final Fantasy Mystic Quest gets a bad rap from people that either it is too easy or it is for children. Well of course both of those are wrong. The game wasn\u2019t super easy like some people claim, but it wasn\u2019t at all difficult either. And come on it isn\u2019t for children, it has a good story and keeps you entertained throughout the entire game. I\u2019ve made the game more challenging as well as added some additional stuff to spice it up a bit.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 15, 2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JCE3000GT", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JL4QWTt1BY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127549\n"}
