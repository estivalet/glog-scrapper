{"name": "Mahoujin GuruGuru 2", "overview": "Mahoujin GuruGuru 2 (\"Spinning Magic Circle 2\") is an action RPG exclusive to the Super Famicom that was released in 1996. It follows the original Mahoujin GuruGuru from 1995 and features similar graphics and gameplay. Wannabe hero Nike and magic apprentice Kukuri are once again tracking down the evil Giri to end his reign of terror. Mahoujin GuruGuru and its sequel are based on the manga of the same name which mocks recurring RPG tropes, including having to perform a lot of side-quests and the turn-based nature of combat, which Enix themselves published between 1992-2003. A forty-five episode anime adaptation of the manga aired shortly before the release of both games.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 12, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TamTam", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34198\n"}
