{"name": "Kamen Rider SD: Shutsugeki!! Rider Machine", "overview": "A racing game that takes the characters from the Kamen Rider tokusatsu TV show and manga and puts them in a much cartoonier, super deformed universe. The game scrolls horizontally like a brawler, but the player (as Kamen Rider) is always in motion on a motorcycle and must destroy the bikes and vehicles of his enemies by kicking and punching to his sides, similar to Road Rash.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 9, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yutaka", "publishers": "Yutaka", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-b3ielCVDc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54371\n"}
