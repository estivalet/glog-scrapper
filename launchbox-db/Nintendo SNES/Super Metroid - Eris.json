Upon receiving mission details, Samus is reminded of the recurring dreams she'd been having the past weeks. Dreams of a cold planet and, in the distance, the faint cries of a child. Could these dreams have something to do with the mysterious disappearance of Eris Stations' research team? The answer lays buried deep within the lethal depths of Eris. Let the mission begin! Die-hard fans of sci-fi will be pleasantly surprised with how the Metroid canon merges with other beloved sci-fi franchises.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 5, 2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital_Mantra", "publishers": "Metroid Construction", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107076\n"}
