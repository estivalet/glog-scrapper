{"name": "Zen-Nihon Pro Wres': Sekai Saikyou Tag", "overview": "An updated version of Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling, Dash updates the character roster and adds minor cosmetic touches to the mix such as wrestler introductions and new character artwork. The biggest addition however is the inclusion of a 4-player royal rumble mode and the ability to perform team-up moves in the tag matches. The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 28, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126603\n"}
