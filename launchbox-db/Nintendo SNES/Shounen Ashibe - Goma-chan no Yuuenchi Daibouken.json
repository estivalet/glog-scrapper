{"name": "Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken", "overview": "Shounen Ashibe: Goma-chan no Yuuenchi Daibouken (lit: \"Boy Ashibe: Goma-chan's Great Amusement Park Adventure\") is a Super Famicom platformer from Nova Co. and Takara. The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible. Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 22, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24147\n"}
