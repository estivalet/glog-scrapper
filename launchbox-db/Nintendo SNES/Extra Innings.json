{"name": "Extra Innings", "overview": "The eye-popping new 16-bit \"Extra Innings\" for your Super NES puts you in the batter's box, on the pitcher's mound, even in the manager's shoes. There's never been a baseball game like it. You control it all. Runners steal, outfielders make diving catches, and pitchers throw everything from smoke to forkballs. But watch out when your pitcher starts wiping his brow - it could be a sign he's starting to tire. \"Extra Innings.\" It beats anything you've ever played.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 9, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sting", "publishers": "Sony Imagesoft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3399\n"}
