{"name": "A Super Mario Thing", "overview": "A collaboration hack made by the Talkhaus community in the style of the VIP and Wall Mix series.It has ASM, graphics, level, sound, and music changes. It is a very strange hack compared to many of the usual ones but it is much worth taking a look at. Enjoy! The game stars Demo, an armless cycloptic demon alien minion (created by LP'er Raocow), caught in the middle of a conflict in the Mushroom Kingdom after her teleporter warped her there while at the same time losing it. The game has Demo venturing to defeat King Charles and to get her teleporter back so she can return home. As ASMT is modeled closer to Japanese-style hacks and was created for Raocow, difficulty is considerably higher than the average hack that would normally be found on SMW Central. Reception to the game has been mixed, with people praising the increased challenge, music, and various gameplay gimmicks, while other have criticized the hack for it fluctuating difficulty.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 8, 2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Talkhaus", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEeRtQeulak", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133907\n"}
