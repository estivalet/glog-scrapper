{"name": "Supapoon DX", "overview": "Supapoon DX is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom that takes the blueprint of the \"block-breaking\" genre and adds various new elements to it, such as a living block that can provide additional power to the ball. The goal of the game is to clear the screen of the shades-wearing yellow balls; the various crystals in the way don't have to be eliminated, but are often placed directly in the way. Supapoon DX is specifically an enhanced remake of 1995's Supapoon. It uses the same world map but features different levels and power-ups. It also includes an intro cutscene for the single-player game and, most overtly, introduces a competitive two-player versus mode. The two-player mode gives each player their own screen of blocks to eliminate, and various power-ups are meant to make the game more challenging for their opponent, such as an arrow that drops the opponent's blocks down a space.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 31, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Yutaka", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82554\n"}
