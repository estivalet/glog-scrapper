{"name": "The 7th Saga", "overview": "This is not your ordinary RPG! The graphics are eye-popping, breath-taking, stunning and unbelievable, not to mention incredible. This is no hack-and-slash, rip-your-guts-out fighter! This is the future of RPGs, right here in your hands! With music this good, you won't turn the sound off--you'll turn it up! No more small elves leading your team! This game contains real, believable figures. You won't be embarrassed to use your own name; you'll be proud. It's just you against six other characters in search of the 7 Sacred Runes. Whoever finds them... Rules the World. It's that simple, that easy. The only problem is you have some enemies, and I don't mean a few. I mean an army of things you've never seen before ready to raise the hair on the back of your neck and take you out with one swing. This is one powerful RPG. Can you handle it?!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 23, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Produce", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Saga", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCucdX1oFQs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/267\n"}
