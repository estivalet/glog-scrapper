This can teach you many tricks and mechanic you might have not know. This is my second hack which is a follow up to \"Super Metroid Containment Chamber\" puzzle hack I made back in 2015. -This is a puzzle hack, You can not proceed without finishing the next puzzle,There is no hidden items and no hidden path. -All the mechanic used are native to the original engine. -If at any point you think you forgot something and need to go back you are misunderstanding the hack. -The hack is not meant to kill you, Recharge stations and saves are plenty full. -Even if you believe this hack is too technical for you, it is good to go through the hack, it will teach you new things about the Super Metroid engine. -If you get stuck and don't know what to do look at the readme/hint file. It contains hints and video links to the solutions.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 3, 2017", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aran Jaeger", "publishers": "Metroid Construction", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134785\n"}
