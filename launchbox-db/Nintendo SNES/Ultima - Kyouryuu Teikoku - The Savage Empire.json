{"name": "Ultima: Kyouryuu Teikoku: The Savage Empire", "overview": "While visiting Professor Rafkin in order to investigate the Orb of the Moons that was found, the orb itself created a warp gate that transports the Avatar to Eodon, a world featuring dinosaurs who live among several warring tribes. Now it's up to the Avatar to bring peace to these warring tribes. Ultima: Kyouryuu Teikoku is a port of Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire. However, the game has been altered in some ways. The most glaring change is that this version eschews turn based combat in favor of a more action oriented combat system. The Avatar also travels alone instead of being in a party of adventurers. Other changes include there being a smaller amount of items to pick up and the day and night cycle being only cosmetic instead of affecting the schedules of the NPC's.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ORIGIN Systems, Inc.", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28871\n"}
