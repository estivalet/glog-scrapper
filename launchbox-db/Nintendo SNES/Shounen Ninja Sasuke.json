{"name": "Shounen Ninja Sasuke", "overview": "A comedic brawler where the player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shounen_Ninja_Sasuke", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31409\n"}
