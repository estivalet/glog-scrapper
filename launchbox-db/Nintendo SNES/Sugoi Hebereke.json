{"name": "Sugoi Hebereke", "overview": "Sugoi Hebereke (\"Amazing Hebereke\") is a 1994 competitive multiplayer arena fighter and a spin-off of the usually more puzzle-focused Hebereke series. Hebereke and his friends take to a number of different arenas to brawl each other. Upon being defeated, the character turns into one of the \"Popoons\" of Hebereke's Popoon (a Puyo Puyo inspired puzzle game). Each arena is depicted from a top-down perspective and has a mix of native obstacles and items that are carried into the arena by smaller \"helper\" characters. These items can make a character stronger, recover their health or even sabotage them. Sugoi Hebereke features Hebereke (penguin), Oh-Chan (girl in cat suit), Sukezaemon (ghost with shades), Jennifer (big-lipped frog), Boo (purple bird), Utsu (alien in cat suit), Pen (boy in penguin suit) and Unyo (alien wearing a helmet). Each has their own array of basic attacks.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82552\n"}
