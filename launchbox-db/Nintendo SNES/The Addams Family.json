Only Gomez can save the day by freeing his son Pugsley, his daughter Wednesday, and Granny - and by restoring Uncle Fester's memory. Accomplishing these tasks is daunting enough, but then Gomez must seek out Morticia in the underground vaults of the Addams mansion and confront the evil Judge in a kooky and spooky climax!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHMSQgEjwtY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3494\n"}
