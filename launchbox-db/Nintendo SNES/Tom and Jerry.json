And now that Jerry's nephew Tuffy is coming for a visit, you can be sure things are going to get even wilder! As Jerry, it's up to you to outwit Tom in a mad dash from the edge of town to the safety of your mouse hole back home. In the 2-player version, you or a friend can take on the role of Tuffy, who comes to visit his uncle Jerry and gets caught up in the chase! 12 levels of action start at the Movie Theater where you must make your way across the marquee and then through the film projector! Then it's on to the Junk Yard where you'll have to make your way out of a hazardous maze filled with old tires and rusty pipes. Next it's the treacherous Toy Store and it's army of wind-up toys. Every location is an adventure in itself, filled with hidden dangers and wild surprises - especially that crafty ol' cat, Tom! And once you make it inside the house, the action really heats up in the Kitchen and on into the Living Room, where a whole lot of trouble stands between you and your mouse hole. So, get your tail into gear, little mouse.
