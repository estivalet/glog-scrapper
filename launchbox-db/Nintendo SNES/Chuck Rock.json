{"name": "Chuck Rock", "overview": "Join Chuck, the most unlikely hero ever, as he fights to save his beautiful wife Ophelia who has been snatched by the pebble-chewing caveman Gary Gritter. Chuck belly-bashes, odor-kicks and uses his favorite technique, rock-tossing, against everything from dinosaurs and boogie men to acidic bubbles. Lead Chuck with his out-of-shape physique and size 14 feet through this wacky adventure, complete with new animation features. Watch Chuck yawn, scratch and sometimes get scared white on his quest to save Ophelia. Even the background and enemy characters have a life of their own. Don't miss the hilarious rock-tossing fun!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Sony Imagesoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Rock", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9wD-xF5rIg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1662\n"}
