{"name": "Jet Pilot Rising", "overview": "This game was produced for the 23rd anniversary of the Super Famicom (released in November 1990). It apparently was coded in a 24 hour period, which is pretty impressive. The game uses artwork from Pixeljoint.com and music from an artist known as stargazer. Only six copies of Jet Pilot Rising were created.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "dforce3000", "publishers": "Homebrew", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93zPokyqaOc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117703\n"}
