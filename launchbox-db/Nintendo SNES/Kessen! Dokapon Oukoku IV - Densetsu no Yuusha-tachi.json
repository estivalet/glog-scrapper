Dokapon Kingdoms IV: Legend of Heroes\") is a mix of an RPG and a multiplayer board game.

Dokapon Okukoku IV is in actuality the very first Dokapon game. It was followed by Dokapon 3-2-1 and Dokapon Gaiden on the Super Famicom and BS Dokapon Gaiden: Hono no Audition for the Super Famicom's Satellaview.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 10, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Betop", "publishers": "Asmik Corporation", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74452\n"}
