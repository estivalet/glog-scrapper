{"name": "Equinox", "overview": "As Glendaal, you wake to a horrifying scene. Evil forces have reduced the town of Galedonia to rubble and turned the villagers into mutant zombies and demons. Your father, the wizard Shadax, must be found, for only he has the magical powers to challenge the evil Sonia. The search for Shadax takes you through overworld and underworld battle zones, from strategic attack positions high in the clouds to eight mysterious dungeons below -- loaded with ghosts, wind demons and traps galore. Moving from dungeon to dungeon, you'll search for the hidden mystical tokens which must be found to complete a game so real that it's hard to believe it's really a game!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Sony Imagesoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1811\n"}
