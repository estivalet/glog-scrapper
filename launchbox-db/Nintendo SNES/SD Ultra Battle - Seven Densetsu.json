{"name": "SD Ultra Battle: Seven Densetsu", "overview": "SD Ultra Battle: Seven Densetsu (\"SD Ultra Battle: Seven Legend\") is a fighter game for the Super Famicom that features super deformed characters from the Ultra Seven series, itself a follow-up to the original Ultraman tokusatsu show. Along with series protagonist Ultraseven, the game also features major kaiju villains Eleking and King Joe as playable characters. The game was a companion product to SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Densetsu, and was released the same day. Both carts employ Bandai's officially licensed Nintendo peripheral the Sufami Turbo to link together to share game data, allowing characters from one game to appear and fight characters in the other. Because Seven Densetsu was released in the miniature Sufami Turbo cartridge format, it cannot be played without that peripheral.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 28, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tom Create", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76636\n"}
