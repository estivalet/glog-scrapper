{"name": "Ryuuki Heidan Danzarb", "overview": "A sci-fi RPG developed by Pandora Box (with additional input from anime giant Gainax) and published by Yutaka for the Super Famicom in Japan only, but it did receive a English fan translation from Aeon Genesis. The game is mission-based, and each mission has different directives. This also means that the player will be expected to perform different activities to successfully conclude the mission. The game's turn-based combat is depicted similarly to Phantasy Star and Dragon Quest: large enemy icons with the player's party's stats displayed underneath.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 23, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gainax", "publishers": "Yutaka", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22456\n"}
