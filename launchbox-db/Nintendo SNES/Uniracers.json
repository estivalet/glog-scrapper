{"name": "Uniracers", "overview": "Single-wheeled and single-minded. Uniracers are the best at what they do: accelerate to screen-blurring speed! They're also awesome at pulling flips, twists, turns and catching monster air off the many mondo ramps, hills and half pipes of their race track worlds. The more outrageous the stunt, the faster the Uniracer goes! The sky's the limit! Racing is the entire purpose of a Uniracer's existence. You can race against the clock, against friends head-to-head or in a custom tournament. Challenge the mysterious ghost bike to become the uni-versal champion! It's one of the fastest races on the Super NES yet!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.01", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWmyjQF1fRs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2104\n"}
