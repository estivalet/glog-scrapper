{"name": "Super Famista 2", "overview": "Super Famista 2 is the sequel to Super Famista/Super Batter Up and part of the larger Famista (Family Stadium) series of baseball sims from Namco. Like its precursor, it has both an exhibition mode and a league mode, as well as options to customize a team. As with every Famista game prior, the athletes are presented as super deformed and the batting/pitching view is from directly behind the batter. Super Famista 2 would be followed up with three more sequels for the Super Famicom. Unlike Super Batter Up, Super Famista 2 was never adapted or localized for the US.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 12, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82639\n"}
