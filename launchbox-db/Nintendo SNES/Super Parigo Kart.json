{"name": "Super Parigo Kart", "overview": "It is a complete hack of Super Mario Kart: New characters, New tracks, New backgrounds, New graphics, AI in GP working, Items and coins placement done, etc \u2026 Note: This is a PAL hack only! The main purpose of this hack was to provide some sort of SMK 2 (same type of tracks, same type of shortcuts, same type of fun, etc\u2026) but with personal features, as the author is a member of the Super Mario Kart community and wanted to add some \u201cprivate jokes\u201d in it for other members \u2026 That\u2019s why some of the backgrounds or characters will appear strange for some people. The game is a follow-up of SMK and can be enjoyed as much as the original.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 16, 2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ScouB", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAEhRlep1v0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133858\n"}
