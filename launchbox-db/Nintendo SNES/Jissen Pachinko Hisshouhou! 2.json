The majority of the Jissen Hisshouhou series concerns pachi-slots instead, making this a rare exception. Like many games in its genre, it splits its focus between teaching players how various real-life pachinko machine models can be manipulated for greater pay-outs, and letting them play and win at virtual facsimiles of those machines as practice. Many of the pachinko machines featured in this game include a slot machine component, which the game also guides players through.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 8, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sammy Corporation", "publishers": "Sammy Corporation", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87497\n"}
