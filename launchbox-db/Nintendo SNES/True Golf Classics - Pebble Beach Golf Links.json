{"name": "True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links", "overview": "Challenge the Power of Pebble Beach This is True Golf Classics, where you'll test your courage against Pebble Beach Golf Links - the most breathtaking course in the world. Experience the draw of the Pacific. Fairways that snake within inches of cliff and beach. Winds that drop to a whisper, then whip up to a roar. Greens that slope invisibly down to the sea. These are the subtle effects that make Pebble Beach famous - and True Golf Classics recreates them in stunning detail. Challenge your friends. Compete in a round of match or stroke play. Bet on a \"skins\" game. Or enter a real pro tournament. Who knows? If you're hot, you could set a course record! Perfect your skills, one stroke at a time. Let loose with your driver on those long par 5's but watch out for the massive bunkers and the majestic Monterey pines. Sharpen your short game, to hit Pebble Beach's pinpoint, spray-splashed greens. When it comes to strategy, True Golf Classics puts you in total control.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 10, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.53", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6029\n"}
