{"name": "Oekaki Logic", "overview": "Oekaki Logic (\"Picture Logic\") is a puzzle game of the picross/nonagram variant, where players create an image using a set of number guides that tell them where to mark a grid to form the desired picture. The game was released by Sekai Bunka Publishing on the Super Famicom via the digital cart-writing \"Nintendo Power\" service around the same time Nintendo themselves were putting out their service-exclusive Picross NP series. The game follows the pattern set by Super Mario no Picross by giving players two \"modes\": the first, and gentler mode, would remonstrate users for errors and fix them on their behalf, but only for a set number of \"lives\"; the second variant would not penalize players for mistakes, but this also meant that the player would be incognizant of errors until it was potentially too late to fix them. In Super Mario no Picross this was represented by \"Mario Mode\" and \"Wario Mode\" respectively, whereas in Oekaki Logic it is a white bear and a brown bear. The game has 90 puzzles spread out across three difficulty levels. Players can defeat each puzzle in either mode, or in both. The game was followed by a sequel, Oekaki Logic 2, in November 1999.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 1, 1999", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marigul", "publishers": "Sekai Bunka", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73741\n"}
