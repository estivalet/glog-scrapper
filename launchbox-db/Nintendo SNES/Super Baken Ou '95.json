{"name": "Super Baken Ou '95", "overview": "Super Baken Ou '95 (\"Super Betting King '95\", where \"baken\" specifically refers to horse betting) is a horse racing simulation game. Unlike its contemporaries, the game does away with the premise of the player raising their own racehorses and is instead a details-heavy predictive engine. The player inputs the data of horses taking part in upcoming races, storing the data of over 100 horses simultaneously, and uses that data to predict which will win. The game was the sixth horseracing simulation to be released for the Super Famicom in 1995 only three months into the year, making horseracing one of the most prolific genres for the system for that period. Though Copya System is not listed in the game's credits on the title screen, which instead credits both Teichiku and Asmik, the game shares many staff members with the contract developer.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Copya System", "publishers": "Asmik", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89642\n"}
