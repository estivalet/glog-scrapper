{"name": "Super Wagan Land", "overview": "Super Wagan Land is the third entry in Namco's Wagan Land series. The game takes advantage of the Super Famicom's hardware with improved visuals, but almost acts as a compilation of the first two games in the series rather than a sequel. The game once again stars green mechanical dinosaur Wagan who stuns enemies with his sound waves. There is a new mini-game, where the player guesses the identity of an item covered by a mosaic. This game also introduces two new features: the ability to adjust difficulty, and passwords to resume progress, both of which would become staples in the series.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 13, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova Games", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/58404\n"}
