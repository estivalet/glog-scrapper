{"name": "Ultimate Fighter", "overview": "Ultimate Fighter is based specifically on the SNES fighter/brawler Hiryu no Ken S: Hyper Version, which in turn is an updated re-release of Hiryu no Ken S: Golden Fighter. Culture Brain localized this updated version as well as including various updates such as the option to speed up the game and additional modes. Some sources incorrectly attribute Ultimate Fighter as being based on the original Hiryu no Ken S: Golden Fighter, but the US game contains the same additional modes and has the same two-letter product code as Hyper Version. Get ready for furious fighting action with ULTIMATE FIGHTER! The evil enemy made a raid on Rick's master's training school, took symbols and swords away, and left a letter of challenge behind. Rick, having vowed to be a true fighter, took up this challenge to win back the lost items. Sharpen your fighting skills and prepare for devastating, bonecrushing battles. Rick's fate is in your hands. The challenge addressed to him is also made to you. The success of his quest depends on your courage, cunning, and flawless martial arts technique.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 11, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Culture Brain", "publishers": "Culture Brain", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6035\n"}
