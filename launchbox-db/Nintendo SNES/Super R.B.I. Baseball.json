{"name": "Super R.B.I. Baseball", "overview": "TAKE ON THE PROS! You've got nearly 700 real major league Baseball Players from all 28 Big League rosters at your control. And you can face them all on their turf - from Chicago's friendly confines to the Big Green Monster in Boston. Step up to the plate as Juan Gonzalez, Frank Thomas, or Cecil Fielder and sink a pearl in the K.C. waterworks, or see what it feels like to stare down the barrel of a loaded cannon when Duane Ward, Randy Johnson, or Roger Clemens lights up the radar at 90 MPH. You can even create your own Dream Team - how would Jose Canseco look in Florida teal or Ken Griffey, Jr. in Yankee pinstripes? You can replay classic baseball moments with the Game Breakers module and rosters of every division champ since 1989. You can even warm up your glove in Defense Practice mode. With Super RBI Baseball, it's a whole new ball game...", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gray Matter", "publishers": "Time Warner Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_R.B.I._Baseball", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niw9N2KgB_M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5889\n"}
