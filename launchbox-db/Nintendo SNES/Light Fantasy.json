{"name": "Light Fantasy", "overview": "Light Fantasy is an RPG with strategy elements. Rather than an action RPG in a Ys vein, Light Fantasy's combat consists of random encounters against groups of enemies in grid-based strategic battles in which player characters need to be moved into place before they can attack effectively. These battles occur on the overworld map, rather than a separate battle screen. The game was followed up with a sequel: Light Fantasy II.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 3, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Advance Communication Company", "publishers": "Tonkin House", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Fantasy", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93073\n"}
