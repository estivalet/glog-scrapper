Pick your power, Jet Ski Watercraft or Ninja Motorcycle you've got the moves of a moray eel and the speed of a hammerhead shark with full range-of-motion maneuverability. Digitized island pics, digitized engine noise and shots of the real machines make you think you're on island time with the spray in your face, the sun on your back and a sure win just past the next reef.
