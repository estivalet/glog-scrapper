{"name": "Super Demo World: The Legend Continues", "overview": "This is the Super Mario World hack made by the man who made Super Mario World hacking easy with Lunar Magic, FuSoYa! What started out as just a demo of what Lunar Magic could do, it turned into a full hack of Super Mario World that\u2019s complete right to the end. This patch is so expansive it expands the size of the ROM to 48mbits! It showcases many of the features in Lunar Magic, including the new tile and palette animation feature included in version 1.60. And it has new custom blocks such as screen-scrolling type pipes that are similar to what you\u2019d see in Mario 3.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 31, 2003", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "FuSoYa", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99749\n"}
