{"name": "Tenshi no Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori", "overview": "Tenshi no Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori (\"The Prayer of the White Wings\") is the third game in the series. It starts a new story, but is set in the same universe; the stories of the two previous games (exclusive to the PC Engine Super CD-ROM) are referred to in this game, and recurrent characters appear. The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with top-down navigation, random enemies, turn-based combat (viewed from first-person perspective), linear story progression, and automatic leveling. The stand-out feature of the game is the ability to communicate with monsters encountered in battle, by learning \"monster languages\". It is possible to convince the monsters not to fight, and even trade and acquire rare items from them.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nippon Telenet", "publishers": "Nippon Telenet", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenshi_no_Uta", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34218\n"}
