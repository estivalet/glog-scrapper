{"name": "HotHead Heights", "overview": "This hack is my first, so please keep that in mind. Mario seems to have heard of some trouble that FryGuy has been causing to the local islands. Goal is to get to the heart of his firey rule and get control of the isles once more! But other than that, it's a kaizo hack. I was trying to aim for a more intermediate level hack, but honestly more so just for what I felt was fun to create. Please make sure to check the readme, it has some important details! UPDATE 1.7 - Fixed the FryGuy boss's slowdown as best I can! Now it's a lot more playable while there might be a little bit of lag, thanks so much to Deakula for being the only one to tell me about Fastrom. Also fixed a bit of clutter and visual stuff.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 27, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hack and Slay", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122058\n"}
