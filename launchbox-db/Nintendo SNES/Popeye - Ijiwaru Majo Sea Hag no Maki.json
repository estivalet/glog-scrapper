Now Popeye must search for the hearts within each of five islands in order to revive them. It won't be easy, as General Bunzo and his troops has issued a \"100,000,000G\" bounty for the hearts. This prompts the likes of Bolo, Ox to try and collect the hearts for the reward. Upon reading this, Brutus decides to quest for the hearts as well in a plan to impress Olive.
