{"name": "Super Mario Bros. The Hunt For The Magical Key", "overview": "I changed the title from Master Quest 8 to Super Mario Bros. The Hunt For The Magical Key. I think it was better with a new title screen; it looks much better now. I did this only because my other Master Quest hacks are not in the hack section anymore, and it's now in the same series as Invaders in Mushroom Kingdom and Dream Courses. Updates in this version: - New Title and Title Screen - New Story (I hope it's sounds better) - Some levels have changed Midway Points - Added more Power Ups in World 7 Castle Emulator/Hardware: - BSNES - SNES HARDWARE - SNES9x Story: Mario's House has been cursed by a magical lock that cannot be opened by a normal key. Mario's objective is to hunt down the Magical Key. Note: Ball n 'Chain from Yoshi's Island has a small glitch, but only in ZSNES 1.51. Otherwise, it works pretty well on ZSNES 1.51. Works perfectly on a real Super Nintendo, bsnes, and SNES9x as well.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 12, 2014", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alex No", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115969\n"}
