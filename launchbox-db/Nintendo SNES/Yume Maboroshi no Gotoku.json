It otherwise plays like a standard JRPG, with a turn-based system that uses large enemy sprites in the center of the screen a la Phantasy Star or Dragon Quest. The game was one of two games ever published by Intec for the Super Famicom. They usually worked with the Turbo CD/PCE-CD system. It was never localized into English or released outside of Japan.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 17, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tose Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Intec Inc.", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91052\n"}
