{"name": "Atmosfear", "overview": "Developed by Beam Software, the same company responsible for Radical Rex, Shadowrun, and Tom & Jerry: Frantic Antics. It was canceled for unknown reasons. The game is relatively unknown, having only been mentioned in media a few times in late 1993 and throughout 1994 in name only. No magazine has been known to have given the game a preview. The goal of the game is to complete each level while avoiding the Gatekeeper's unfair rules, which occur randomly. Bathory's Castle appears to be the least finished, as it doesn't seem like it can be completed.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/EwKCEG2lBgs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114672\n"}
