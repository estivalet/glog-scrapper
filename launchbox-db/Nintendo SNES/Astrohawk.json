{"name": "Astrohawk", "overview": "AstroHawk is an Asteroids variant originally created as a homebrew ROM game in the 90s and released for the first time on a cartridge in 2013. Like the original title the player controls a space ship using a top-down view and moved around with bursts of thrust. The screen also scrolls endlessly in all directions as the ship always remain in the middle of the screen. The ship has an unlimited amount of bullets and can shoot in all directions. There are both asteroids and enemies to defeat. A radar in the top left corner of the screen shows what is incoming. The ship has a life meter and can take a few hits. Unlike the original game there is an open world progression where different sectors can be tackled in any order by selecting them on a world map. There are also some settings that can be defined before entering a level: six types of firing patterns, two types of bombs and three types of shields. The game keeps track of the score.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Playsoft.
