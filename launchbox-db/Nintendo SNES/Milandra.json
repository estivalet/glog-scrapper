{"name": "Milandra", "overview": "A strange Rogue-Style type of RPG that allows you to control multiple characters. The characters can be given specific A.I. orders or you can manually control them one by one, which comes in handy whenever large groups of enemies are around. The game features character designs by the popular Noriko Nagano and is fairly rare as far as Super Famicom titles go.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 31, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tomcat Systems", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl820_uOoG4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34223\n"}
