{"name": "Super Metroid Arcade: Endless Mode", "overview": "King Of Kraid - It is the year 1980. A ground breaking arcade game named 'Super Metroid' has been released. Quarters are being thrown at it like pebbles. Bad Atari ports are being made in an attempt to cash in on its success. The race is on for who can get the highest score. You have the chance to become the new Billy Mitchell! A continuously randomizing, challenging Super Metroid ROM Hack: - When you enter a door, it will put out in a random room and lock the door behind you, forcing you to complete the room or pick up an item. - Enemy Damage increases over time. - The Space Jump, Gravity Suit, Screw Attack, and Plasma Beam are temporary. They disappear after a certain amount of time (Indicated on the HUD). - Mother Brain doesn't trigger the ending sequence. Instead, she's just a normal boss. The Hyper Beam phase has been removed, so you won't need 300HP to defeat her. - Scoring System and Achievements - Go for the high score by defeating foes or clearing rooms, and be rewarded for performing various speedrunning tricks or playing creatively! - Difficulty Selection - Four optional difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard and Arcade) to tailor the experience to any skill level. - Time Attack Mode - Play with a continually running countdown timer. Buy yourself more time by defeating challenging bosses, or racking up insane point totals! - Add your score to our Online Leaderboards over at http://arcade.supermetroid.run / https://www.youtube.com/user/mcjairjr/featured?sub_confirmation=1", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 5, 2017", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcMZLT9rbxM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93400\n"}
