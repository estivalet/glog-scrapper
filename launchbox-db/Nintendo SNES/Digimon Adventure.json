{"name": "Digimon Adventure", "overview": "Digimon Adventure (aka Digimon) is a pirated platformer for SNES and Game Boy Advance based on Digimon. The game uses the same engine as found in Pocket Monster, thus the gameplay mechanics are exactly the same. The game spans six levels, which includes two boss fights. The only playable character is Agumon. You can attack enemies by pressing A to shoot a fireball at them. Each level has a strawberry item that once collected transforms you into Greymon, who's fireball attack is much larger and stronger. Once you lose all your lives you are given a chance to continue, and there's no apparent limit to continues either.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sintax", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105874\n"}
