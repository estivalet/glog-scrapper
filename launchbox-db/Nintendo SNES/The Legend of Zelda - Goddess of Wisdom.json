{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Goddess of Wisdom", "overview": "This hack was originally called \u2013Zelda Shards of Might\u2013. It was made by Omega and SePH, But unfortunately it was bugged. Zelda didn\u2019t appear in the guardhouse. This could be fixed, but the forest dungeon was heavily bugged. The game was unsolvable. Luckily Francais from France removed those major bugs. He called the hack \u2013Zelda Link to the future Chapter 3\u2013. But the game was still bugged. You get Zelda at the beginning, but when you talk to your uncle, she disappeared. Some entrances were switched, which would result in false game play and all jumps diagonally-down would crash the game. You can\u2019t rescue Zelda since there is no staircase that leads to the priest, so the rain never stops and the palace guards did\u2019t disappear. The game was again unsolvable. I have removed all mentioned bugs and have made new gameplay. Two dungeons were extended. There were also crash bugs inside the dungeons. All this was fixed. Sometimes, the logic of the dungeon was false (some key doors were optional or there would be a key behind the key door). Plus, you really don\u2019t know if you should search for pendants or crystals. All this was fixed.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 17, 2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Francais, Omega, PuzzleDude, SePH", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99750\n"}
