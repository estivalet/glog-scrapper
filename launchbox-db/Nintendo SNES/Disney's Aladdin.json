{"name": "Disney's Aladdin", "overview": "Disney\u2019s Aladdin is a side-scrolling platformer putting players in control of the movie's hero and his monkey Abu through seven stages set in the city of Agrabah. Aladdin can defeat foes by jumping on them or disorienting them with apples, while collecting gems and power-ups and avoiding dangerous obstacles along the way. Bonus mini-games offer up the chance to win extra lives from the Genie or take a magic carpet ride with princess Jasmine. The game was released in November 1993, the same month that another game with the same title was released by Virgin Games for Sega Genesis. The two games vary in some respects; in the Virgin game, Aladdin wields a scimitar, which is not the case in the Capcom game. Aladdin proved to be a commercial success, selling approximately 1.8 million copies worldwide, becoming Capcom's highest-selling game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System after Street Fighter II and its various versions. Shinji Mikami, the game's designer, said that if he had not made the SNES game, he \"would probably buy\" the Virgin game because it has a sword and better animation.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 21, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Aladdin_(Capcom_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN1uavz3MAg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2715\n"}
