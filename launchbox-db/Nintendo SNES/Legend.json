Only you can free the people of Sellech, and keep Clovis from resurrecting the evil power and curses of Beldor. Enter the Black Temple and battle through worlds of wizards and fire breathing dragons. Conquer the baddest boss monsters ever seen and fight your way through the uncharted world of Legend.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcade Zone", "publishers": "Seika", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.49", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(1994_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78QuuR-YbyY&ab_channel=Billybobjr", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5307\n"}
