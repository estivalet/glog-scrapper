{"name": "Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjyouki", "overview": "Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjyouki (\"Super Mystery Puyo 2: Rulue's Prosperity Through Brute Force\", roughly) is an RPG/puzzle game for the Super Famicom and the sequel to Super Nazo Puyo, itself a spin-off in the Puyo Puyo/Madou Monogatari franchise. Instead of the dual routes of Super Nazo Puyo, Rulue is now the only protagonist. The game sees Rulue travelling an overworld, talking to NPCs and finding items to solve puzzles. In addition, she must occasionally solve Puyo Puyo grids whenever she bumps into an enemy. These grids are designed with pre-determined puyo combinations and a specific win condition in mind - the player must work out the correct solution to progress. Each \"battle\" has three parts that the player must solve, with only a finite number of times they can fail. The game features the normal story mode and a second mode where the player must progress through a series of progressively more difficult puzzle grids.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 28, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Compile", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47233\n"}
