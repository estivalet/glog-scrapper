{"name": "Nage Libre: Seijaku no Suishin", "overview": "Nage Libre, or Nage Libre ~Seijaku no Suishin~ (\"Freestyle ~Depth of Silence~\", Nage Libre being the French for \"freestyle swimming\") is a strategy game exclusive for the Super Famicom. It features five heroines who compete with one another in highschool-related events to escape back to their homeworld. These battles are represented on a grid-like battlefield, common to strategy games of the era, and when two units meet on the battlefield the game switches to its card-based combat system. The player randomly draws a hand of five cards when combat begins, spending one and then drawing a new card every round. The cards can involve attacking the opponent, defending from incoming damage, using magic to heal the player character's HP, a chance to escape combat as well as a number of other abilities that appear less frequently, like exchanging health with the opponent or switching costumes. The game saw a 1997 Sony PlayStation sequel: Nage Libre: Rasen no Soukoku.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Varie", "publishers": "Varie", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74483\n"}
