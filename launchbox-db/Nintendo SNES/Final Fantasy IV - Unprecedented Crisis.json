{"name": "Final Fantasy IV: Unprecedented Crisis", "overview": "This is a complete hack of Final Fantasy 4 (2 US) for SNES which shows off many of the features of the hacking utility, FF4kster. There are a few assembly hacks which cannot be achieved within the editor alone, but they are few in number and mostly for cosmetic purposes. It may seem at first that the changes are limited to gameplay and the plot is unchanged, but don\u2019t worry, there is a point in the plot after which it branches from the original and begins an entirely new chain of events. Visit the Training Room in Baron for a cursory overview of the changes from FF4/FF2US and other miscellaneous hints and tips.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 24, 2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pinkpuff", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126203\n"}
