{"name": "Super Mario Starlight Remix", "overview": "Mario has to save both King Apollo and the Princess! This hack features 96 new levels with an average level design, though cutoff and other various minor things can still be found throughout playing this hack. The secrets are frankly a breeze. A new Overworld is not made either. On the other hand, new graphics add to a nice, smooth game-play! As a result, this huge hack is worth giving a try.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 9, 2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "hack (Clay Cowgill)", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131650\n"}
