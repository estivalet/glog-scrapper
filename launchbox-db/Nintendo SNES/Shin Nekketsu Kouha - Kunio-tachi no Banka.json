{"name": "Shin Nekketsu Kouha: Kunio-tachi no Banka", "overview": "The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course). Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss. Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyoko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Almanic", "publishers": "Technos Japan", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.52", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Nekketsu_K%C5%8Dha:_Kunio-tachi_no_Banka", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pN1krUCiXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22560\n"}
