{"name": "Kabuki Chou Reach Mahjong", "overview": "Kabuki Machi Reach Mahjong is a mahjong game created for the Super Famicom by obscure developer Studio Softmov. It would be the only game they ever develop. The game features an overworld map, allowing the player to move from location to location playing mahjong with various people. It features four-player mahjong, which became the norm in the 16-bit era (the 8-bit era often had to fall back to one-on-one games due to lack of computing power).", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio Softmov", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87508\n"}
