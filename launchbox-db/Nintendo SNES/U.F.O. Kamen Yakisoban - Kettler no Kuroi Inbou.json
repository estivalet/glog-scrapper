{"name": "U.F.O. Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler no Kuroi Inbou", "overview": "UFO Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler no Kuroi Inbou (\"UFO Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler's Black Conspiracy\") is a brawler featuring UFO Kamen Yakisoban, a character designed to market Nissin's Yakisoba UFO brand of instant yakisoba circa 1993-1995. It understandably features a variety of foodstuffs. In the game, Yakisoban's bride-to-be Mayumi has been kidnapped by the villainous Kettler who wishes to marry her himself (and of course to destroy the concept of delicious Nissin Brand \u00a9 instant Yakisoba!). Yakisoban is obviously a bit dense, as he's standing at the altar and doesn't even realize Mayumi is not there until part-way through the ceremony.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 14, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "Den'Z", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_Kamen_Yakisoban", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq55xSDiwHc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81265\n"}
