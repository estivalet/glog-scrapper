{"name": "Kidou Butouden G Gundam", "overview": "Kidou Butouden G Gundam is based on the 1994 anime TV series of the same name. The first Gundam production not set in the continuity established in the 1979 original series of the franchise, G Gundam presents a world in which global conflicts are settled in a yearly tournament fought between Gundam mecha, each representing its nation's qualities (and stereotypes). Naturally, this premise was adapted into a one-on-one fighting game. The game includes 10 different Gundams (one of which can only be selected by players via a secret code), each with its own arena and background music.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 27, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pandora Box", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLRhqauIiBU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24794\n"}
