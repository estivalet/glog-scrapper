{"name": "Super Metroid: Ascent", "overview": "Unleash the colors !!! Ascent is a full hack of super metroid. More super metroid with same gameplay but whole new level design, new visuals and even some new mechanics. It has approximately the same amount of rooms as original game but bigger rooms and the difficulty is harder than original but not too much. The hack gameplay focus on puzzles, exploration and challenges. The focus on puzzles is stronger than most hacks. However there is multiple ways to advance or solve a problem. This is my first real attempt at hacking, there could be some weird moments of me trying stuff :D, but nothing will be out of place assets or ideas. Metroid for me is a huge alien underground isolated maze and this is what it will be about. The main idea of this hack is like multiple small hacks put into one with a connected progression and world. So its more levels based. (multiple zones) With map portions closing behind you at the end of the zone. You will see where it ends on the map ingame. Start at the abyss of the planet and ascend your way up to the surface. Will you be able to defeat the black parasites and reach the extraction point ? find out in ascent", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 27, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Benox50", "publishers": "Metroid Construction", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133529\n"}
