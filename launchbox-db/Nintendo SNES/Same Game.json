{"name": "Same Game", "overview": "A puzzle game based on the \"samegame\" model, where players remove grouped amount of icons with the intent to clear the entire board with no remainders. They can only remove icons if they are grouped together in groups of two and more, and only count as grouped if the icons are touching horizontally or vertically. The game features a number of Hudson characters, each of which is used as the basis for the puzzle icons. Depending on the difficulty, the player can expect to match icons based on Hudson's Momotaro Densetsu/Dentetsu series, Bomberman series, Bonk series, and the Milon games Milon's Secret Castle and the then-upcoming DoReMi Fantasy: Milon's DokiDoki Adventure.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hudson", "publishers": "Hudson", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32981\n"}
