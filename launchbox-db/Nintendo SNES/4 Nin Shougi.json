Each player starts on one side of the board and has with fewer pieces than in the standard two-player game. Each side has their king, a rook, two gold generals, two silver generals and three pawns. Players have the option of temporarily teaming up with other players to knock others out of the game. The game features two viewing modes: one that represents the pieces as their traditional shogi tiles, and another that turns them into sprites which have animations when moving across the board or taking pieces. The player can also choose between eight characters for their computer opponents, four of which are non-human: a chimpanzee, a shiba inu, a cat and a tentacle alien.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 14, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Planning Office Wada", "publishers": "Planning Office Wada", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30741\n"}
