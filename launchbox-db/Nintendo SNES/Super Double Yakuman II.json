{"name": "Super Double Yakuman II", "overview": "The fifth game in the Double Yakuman series, though only the second to be released on Super Famicom. It is a barebones budget mahjong game intended to cut to the chase, with a selection of opponents to choose from before moving straight into a four-person game. In comparison to many other straightforward mahjong games, Super Double Yakuman II has some lighthearted elements, with its silly CPU anime portraits and over-the-top victory celebrations.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 14, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Unknown", "publishers": "Vap Inc.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89730\n"}
