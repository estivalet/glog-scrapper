{"name": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 3: Yoshimoto Gekijou Hen", "overview": "Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 3 is the third of four Super Nichibutsu Mahjong games for the Super Famicom. It has two-, three- and four-player mahjong modes, though only one human player is allowed. The third game in the series cuts back on the salacious bunny girls of the first two, instead focusing on super deformed caricature portraits and comedy elements. Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 3 sits between 1993's Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 2 and 1996's Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 4. Its subtitle \"Yoshimoto Gekijou Hen\" means \"Yoshimoto Theater Volume\", referring to the Yoshimoto talent agency which represents a lot of Japanese comedians.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90005\n"}
