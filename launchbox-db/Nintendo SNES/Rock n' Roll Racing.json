{"name": "Rock n' Roll Racing", "overview": "Yeah! With music and engines scream'N, you pick your car, driver and weapons, then slam it into gear. With world-famous race announcer Larry \"Supermouth\" Huffman at the mike and some of the greatest Rock N' Roll music of all time setting the tone, it's time for the line! Using laser cannons, cluster bombs and super boosters to annihilate your competition, your racing skills are pitted against a truly gruesome field of lead-footed crazies as you race to different planets. Better yet, with each checked flag your pile of cash grows and so does your buying power! More weapons! More engines! More armor! So back off wimps, this race ain't for no Sunday drivers!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 4, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silicon & Synapse", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.28", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_n%27_Roll_Racing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwbFzHHGD4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2134\n"}
