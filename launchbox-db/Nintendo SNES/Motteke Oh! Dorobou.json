{"name": "Motteke Oh! Dorobou", "overview": "Motteke Oh! Dorobou (\"Take It! Oh! Thief\") is a comedic board game that has a group of player-controlled thieves working against each other and against AI-controlled law enforcement to complete a heist and get away with a fortune of filthy lucre. The game is framed like a board game heavy with random events that can help or obstruct the player's chances of success in a manner similar to the Jinsei Game series, the Japanese equivalent of Milton Bradley's The Game of Life. The player can select between six career thieves, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and chooses three more for their opponents.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74482\n"}
