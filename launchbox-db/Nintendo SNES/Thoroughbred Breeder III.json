{"name": "Thoroughbred Breeder III", "overview": "Thoroughbred Breeder III is the fourth game in Hect's Thoroughbred Breeder horse raising/racing simulation series, and the third and final game from the series to be released on the Super Famicom. The series would see one more entry after this: 1998's Thoroughbred Breeder: Sekai Seiha-hen for the Sony PlayStation. The player is once again given a stable to manage and must raise and race champion racehorses to be a successful breeder. The third entry includes enhanced feedback during races, letting the player know the positions of all the horses in the race and, towards the final stretch, each horse's stamina meters and exertion levels. This helps them determine how their own horses in the race are doing, and the areas that might need improvement.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 18, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hect", "publishers": "Hect", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82797\n"}
