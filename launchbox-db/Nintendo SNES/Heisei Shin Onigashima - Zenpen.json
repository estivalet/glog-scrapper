{"name": "Heisei Shin Onigashima: Zenpen", "overview": "An adventure game based on the old Japanese fairy tale about Momotaro, a boy who was found by an old couple inside of a huge peach (hence the name Momotaro - \"Peach Guy\"). Momotaro grows up and embarks on a journey to rid the land of the vicious tribe of ogres, and to take their treasures. On his way he meets three animals - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, who help him to defeat the ogres. This game is the first part of the story, and is divided into two large chapters, the first telling the story of the dog Ringo, the second the story of the monkey Matsunosuke. In this adventure, you interact with the world by selecting various commands from a menu. Along with traditional commands such as \"Look\" or \"Take\" there are situation-specific commands, for example \"Smell\" for the dog. In certain places it is possible to move by navigating the character physically.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73644\n"}
