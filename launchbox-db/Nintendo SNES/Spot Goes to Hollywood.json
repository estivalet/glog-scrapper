{"name": "Spot Goes to Hollywood", "overview": "Spot Goes to Hollywood was an early 3D style platform. Although it came out on the Sega Genesis/Megadrive and 32-bit systems, the SNES version never made it out. This game was supposed to come out when the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit systems was ongoing. In fact, it seems the 32-bit versions of this game were announced even before the 16-bit versions. In the October 1995 issue of EGM, there was a preview of Spot, which shows some screenshots from both the Genesis and SNES versions of the game. In the November 1995 issue of Nintendo Power, they state that Virgin had abandoned the system and sold the rights to publish Spot Goes to Hollywood to Acclaim. In an interview with Retro Video Gamer, programmer Ed Magnin states the game was cancelled after it was already finished and ready for submission to Nintendo.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126606\n"}
