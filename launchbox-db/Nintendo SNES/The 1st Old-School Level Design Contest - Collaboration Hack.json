{"name": "The 1st Old-School Level Design Contest: Collaboration Hack", "overview": "The 1st ever Old-School Level Design Contest was held in 2017, and features 83 submissions as well as 4 switch palaces and 3 judge levels, totaling at 90 levels with 113 exits. The compilation was kept as vanilla as possible to keep with the \"SMW-like\" feeling, but some exceptions were made (e.g. in the overworld) where custom resources were used. It's nothing too flashy or appealing, again to not interfere with the traditional feeling.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 29, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SMW Central", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DLhhqJ56UY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106263\n"}
