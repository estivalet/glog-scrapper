{"name": "ActRaiser 2", "overview": "THE LEGACY CONTINUES! Every once in awhile a game comes out that is so good, people can't stop talking about it - a game that seems to rise above the others. ACTRAISER for the SNES was that game. We don't need to remind you of how good the graphics were. We don't have to tell you about the music. We could have just sat back and been satisfied with the recognition it's received. Instead, we decided to make something even better: ACTRAISER 2! We've improved the graphics, improved the sound and created a game we're confident will once again set the standard for all SNES games. HE'S BACK! The most feared demons of all time have combined their power and raised the Lord of Evil, TANZRA. Now alive, TANZRA's hatred for you runs eternal. Vowing revenge, he has sent his demons to attack your people and destroy everything! You must put an end to this once and for all. This time however, it won't be easy!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 29, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quintet", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActRaiser_2", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY9kKFa4eiU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1017\n"}
