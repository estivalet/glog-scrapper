{"name": "Hissatsu Pachinko Collection 4", "overview": "Hissatsu Pachinko Collection 4 (\"Sure-Fire Pachinko Collection 4\") is the fourth and final game in SunSoft's Hissatsu Pachinko Collection. As with the previous three games in the series, it features a life sim element and a number of virtual approximations of real-life pachinko machines that were in operation at the time. The previous game used machines from Daiichi, but this one uses Kyouraku's output instead. Kyouraku is best known from Telenet Japan's own \"virtual pachinko\" series Parlor! Parlor!. Nifty Serve, a Japanese internet service provider, also appears in the game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87477\n"}
