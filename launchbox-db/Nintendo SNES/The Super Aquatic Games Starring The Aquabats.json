{"name": "The Super Aquatic Games Starring The Aquabats", "overview": "Get Ready... Get Set... Get Wet! Perilous missions, wicked villains, and gorgeous mermaids make up the everyday life of an Underwater Agent. But even a top Fish operative needs an occasional break from the undersea grottos of international intrigue! Fish agents are no wet blankets when it comes to leisure time. They'd rather hook onto some fun, furious action than lie in the sun like a bunch of beached whales. That's why they started the Super Aquatic Games - 8 Competitive Events, a Bonus Event, and a Secret Special Event that really separates the men from the minnows! So start pumping those gills and aim for the Fin-ish Line - it's time to go for the gold (fish)!", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Millenium Interactive", "publishers": "Seika Corp", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.47", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8900\n"}
