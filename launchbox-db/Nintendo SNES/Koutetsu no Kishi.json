{"name": "Koutetsu no Kishi", "overview": "Koutetsu no Kishi (\"Steel Knight\") is a WW2 turn-based strategy game in which the player assumes the role of Fritz Kraemer, a prominent German Waffen-SS and Heer (army) officer. The player, as Kraemer, must succeed in various campaigns led by Nazi Germany just before and up until the end of the second World War. The game was originally released on the NEC PC-9801 by General Support and was ported to the Super Famicom two years later by Dual and Asmik Ace. The Super Famicom version was followed by two sequels: Koutetsu no Kishi 2: Sabaku no Rommel Shougun and Koutetsu no Kishi 3: Gekitotsu Europe Sensen. It was one of a handful of games to support the SNES Mouse peripheral. Possibly due to its focus on German WW2 campaigns, neither Koutetsu no Kishi nor its sequels were ever released outside of Japan.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 19, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dual", "publishers": "Asmik", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87571\n"}
