{"name": "Super Mahjong 2: Honkaku 4Jin Uchi", "overview": "Super Mahjong 2: Honkaku 4Jin Uchi (\"Super Mahjong 2: Real 4-Player Strike\") is a mahjong game from I'Max and the sequel to Super Mahjong. As its subtitle attests, Super Mahjong 2 allows for a full four-person game of mahjong as opposed to the two-person limitation of its predecessor. The opponents are no longer based on real people, but are still somewhat comical in their implementation. The game also takes a leaf from Super Nichibutsu Mahjong's book by adding bunny girls to many of its menus. There was one more Super Mahjong game for the Super Famicom: Super Mahjong 3. Like most mahjong games, Super Mahjong 2 was never released outside of Japan.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 2, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "I'Max", "publishers": "I'Max", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89999\n"}
