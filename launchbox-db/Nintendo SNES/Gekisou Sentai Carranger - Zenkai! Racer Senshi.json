{"name": "Gekisou Sentai Carranger: Zenkai! Racer Senshi", "overview": "Gekisou Sentai Carranger: Zenkai! Racer Senshi (\"Sprint Squad Carranger: Full Throttle! Racer Soldiers\") is a side-scrolling action game featuring the Carranger, a squad of costumed warriors who are supported by special car constellations and fight to protect the Earth from a reckless alien biker gang. The original Japanese show is played as a parody of Super Sentai, but its action footage is used in the otherwise serious Turbo Power Rangers series. In the game, the player moves across levels fighting minor foes before coming up against one of the show's many named foes as a boss encounter. Throughout the level the player can hit signs for bonus power-ups and collect \"parts\" from destroying vehicles and hitting other notable objects in the environment. Gekisou Sentai Carranger was the ninth game to come from Bandai's range of Sufami Turbo-exclusive titles: licensed games built on special smaller carts which required a plug-in peripheral to play on a Super Famicom. These smaller carts were more cost-effective for Bandai to produce, and could also communicate with other Sufami Turbo carts in a few rare cases.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 23, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73295\n"}
