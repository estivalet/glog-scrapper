{"name": "Nakajima Satoru Kanshuu: F-1 Hero '94", "overview": "Nakajima Satoru F-1 Hero '94 is a Super Famicom Formula One driving game endorsed by Satoru Nakajima. Presently, it is the last game to carry his endorsement. The game was also sponsored by FOCA and Fuji TV: the former license allowed them to use team/driver names, while the latter is the TV station that held the rights to show Formula One on Japanese television. The game, like the previous Nakajima Satoru Super F-1 Hero, uses Mode 7 for its races. The game also features drivers and teams from the 1994 F1 season that the player can choose for their vehicle, and a number of customization options.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Varie", "publishers": "Varie", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81999\n"}
