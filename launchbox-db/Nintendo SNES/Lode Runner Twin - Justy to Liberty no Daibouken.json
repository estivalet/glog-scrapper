{"name": "Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken", "overview": "Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken (\"Justy and Liberty's Big Adventure\") is a Lode Runner game for the Super Famicom. As with its predecessors, the goal of the game is to run around a 2D map grabbing items and avoiding enemies. The player can dig holes ahead and behind them (there's a separate button for each) in order to temporarily trap enemies or create shortcuts for themselves. The game's stand out feature is its two player mode. Justy and Liberty, a brother and sister team of wizards, are tasked by the King to clear a series of mazes under the castle, many of which have unusual themes like toys and candy. Two players can play simultaneously to cooperatively complete the game's levels, or can compete against each other instead in a separate battle mode.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SGFOFwmrBE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32703\n"}
