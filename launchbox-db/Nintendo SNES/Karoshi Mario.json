{"name": "Karoshi Mario", "overview": "This is Karoshi Mario, based off of the original game by Jesse Venbrux. In case you never played Karoshi before, the objective is to kill yourself. That's it. It's harder than it may sound sometimes, though. The objective of this game is not to emulate the original, but to put Mario in a similar type of situation. The only custom stuff this includes is a small amount of custom GFX and a lot of custom ASM. I didn't want to add too much custom music or graphics for fear of making the game not feel like you are in the SMW universe.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 9, 2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HuFlungDu", "publishers": "SMW Central", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThoirZlKgSE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106215\n"}
