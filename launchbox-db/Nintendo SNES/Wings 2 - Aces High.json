{"name": "Wings 2: Aces High", "overview": "5,000 meters over France. Spying a pair of prowling enemy planes, you slam the stick forward and enter a screaming dive. Finger on the trigger, your plane shudders from the recoil of tracer splitting machine guns. Enemy number two rolls high over his smoking wingman into the sun. Bullets tear through your cockpit, but you fly tough. Chop the throttle, yank back on the stick and the Fokker overshoots, filling your sights. He's yours. Wings 2 plunges you into the swirling air battles of WW I. Arcade style control combined with sharp digitized graphics forge a new standard for flight games.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 29, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acme Interactive", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3122\n"}
