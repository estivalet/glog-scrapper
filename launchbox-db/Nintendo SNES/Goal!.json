{"name": "Goal!", "overview": "Goal! is a soccer game featuring an Exhibition mode and a Super Cup mode. In the Exhibition mode the player gets to choose from 24 different international teams and play the computer or another player in a single soccer match. The Super Cup mode lets the player select a team and play against the three other teams in the group on their road to winning the Super Cup. Before a soccer game starts, players get to choose a formation and set the game options. Options include turning on or off offsides, fouls, radar (a minimap showing where the players are positioned on the field), and whether to make the goal kick automatic or not. Players can also set the amount of time the each half of the game will last from as low as 1 minute to all the way up to 45 minutes.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 24, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3563\n"}
