Sk\u00fcljagger combines a high-powered action game with a clue-filled story to create the biggest 16-bit experience ever! THE GAME: Get ready for the eye-popping graphics and innovative gameplay of 21 main maps and over 50 hidden maps. It's all-out war as you fight savage Kiltish troops, battle wild Westican bladebacks, explore the ancient Lost City of Urnum, and bring the merciless Captain Skuljagger to his knees. THE BOOK: The 80 page book-crammed with amazing illustrations-tells the saga of a Westican rebel named Storm Jaxon, and his battle to free his island nation from the cruel rule of Captain Sk\u00fcljagger. When Storm steals Sk\u00fcljagger's sword, he sparks a massive revolution against the Captain's fearsome Kiltish Army. And if you think Sk\u00fcljagger's going to take this revolution lying down, then maybe you've forgotten how hacked-off a maniacal Kiltish despot can get. The book's also jam-packed with hidden clues-if you can figure them out, they'll help you find tons of hidden, secret things in the game. Ground-breaking. Challenging. Awesome.
