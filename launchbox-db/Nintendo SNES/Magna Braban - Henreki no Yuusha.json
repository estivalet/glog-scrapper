The game's main view is an overhead map of a specific location, such as a town, where the characters move and can interact with NPCs. Upon leaving an area, the view changes to a larger overworld map showing locations of interest. The battles are viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters automatically engage and perform their actions. While the player does not directly control any of the characters, they can pause the battle at time and assign new strategies (such as melee, use long-ranged attacks or use Magic) to each character. Experience points and gold are awarded after each battle, the later of which can be used to purchase equipment and items.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lenar", "publishers": "ASK", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14323\n"}
