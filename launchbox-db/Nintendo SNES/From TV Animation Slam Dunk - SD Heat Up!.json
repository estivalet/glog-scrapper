It is the third adaptation of Slam Dunk for the Super Famicom, via the developer/publisher team of TOSE and Bandai, and the fifth and presently final video game based on the license overall.The big change for this particular game are the graphics: rather than the semi-realistic manga art style of its predecessors, the game reimagines the characters as large-headed \"super deformed\" characters. The game and its plot are distinctively more cartoonish as a result.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 27, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73289\n"}
