In this prototype enemies can\u2019t harm the main character, every path lead to a dead end and sound is absent. Also in the introduction the spaceship that is zoomed in/out and rotated don\u2019t appear correctly.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Iguana Entertainment", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92832\n"}
