{"name": "Zenkoku Juudan Ultra Shinri Game", "overview": "A spin-off of Visit's Shinri Game quiz series that frames its probing questions with a geographical TV quiz show. Zengoku Juudan Ultra Shinri Game (\"National Longitudinal Slice Ultra Psychology Game\", referring to how the in-game game show selects a region for a question by picking its longitude) is a quiz show for the Super Famicom that opts for questions of a more personality-test nature. With every Shinri Game, these questions are presented with a distinct framing device: in Zengoku Juudan's case, the game is presented as if it was a TV game show that pulls its questions from specific regions and prefectures of Japan. It follows three previous Shinri Games for the system, but isn't a true sequel - The Shinri Game IV, released on PlayStation in 1998, is the \"true\" fourth The Shinri Game.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 5, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ukiyotei Company, Ltd.", "publishers": "Visit", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86054\n"}
