{"name": "Quickie World 2", "overview": "Luigi wants some too. Quickie World 2 is a fast paced Kaizo Light hack with very forgiving difficulty and no \"trolls\". It aims to provide an exciting challenge for players that would rather not spend hours grinding a single level. The game features 24 exits (although the counter will only display a maximum of 22, since both the any% and 100% castles trigger the credits), some of which are secret. Also hidden throughout are 22 secret (and optional) portrait rooms dedicated to streamers I enjoy watching. Here's some of the things you won't find in Quickie World 2: - Cutscenes - Kaizo Blocks (I mean it this time ;D) - Water Levels - Autoscrollers - Ice Physics - HUD -\"Trolls\" I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who played the original and encouraged me during the creation of the sequel. I hope you enjoy Quickie World 2, and remember: Go fast, don't hesitate, and it'll be alright. :) Small Note: Red coins on castle 2 are meant to have a white outline. This makes the level fair for colorblind players.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 8, 2019", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Valdio", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114404\n"}
