{"name": "Super Turrican 2", "overview": "Twice the Firepower. Twice the Burn. If you haven't played Super Turrican, chances are you won't last past the intro sequences here... As an intergalactic hero-wannabe commissioned to crush a venomous mutant armada, you are thrust into a chaotic world even more violent than the original. This time there are more enemies to torch (and be torched by) - including the most heinous level bosses on 16-bit - and enough Mode 7 graphic levels to make you wish mommy were there to hold your hand. But she'll be busy cleaning up your charred carcass.", "platform": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Factor 5", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzvK-1snXb4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5898\n"}
