{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shin Onryou Senki", "overview": "Shin Onry\u014d Senki is a remake of Onry\u014d Senki. The story and most of the dialogues remain the same as in the original release; gameplay-wise, the versions are also nearly identical, utilizing the same menu-based verb-object commands. The differences lie mostly in visual presentation and technical quality of the music. The graphics are by far more technically advanced; most locations have been re-drawn from scratch. Digitized photos are used to represent some of the characters, and anime-like style is less pronounced. Many locations and scenes have been expanded, with additional close-ups, different angles, etc. A few locations have been added or made accessible at different moments during the course of the game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fujicom", "publishers": "Fujicom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104171-shin-onryou-senki\n"}
