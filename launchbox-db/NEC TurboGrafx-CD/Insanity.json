{"altername_name": [], "name": "Insanity", "overview": "Imprisoned by an army of robots on a giant space station, you know there's only one thing you can do - blast your way out. That pretty much sums up the plot of Insanity, the first PC Engine game from homebrew developers Aetherbyte Studios. Insanity is essentially a clone of the classic arcade game Berzerk and retains the straightforward gameplay of the original. You run around the flip-screen play area (whose map layout is randomly generated from a selection of master templates) shooting the robots that are out to get you. The robots are pretty dumb to begin with and often blow themselves up by wandering into the electrified walls, but as you progress they get a little faster and a lot more aggressive, making anticipation and dodging of lasers key skills. The action is accompanied by a selection of retro styled music tracks, giving you the option of CD music or chip generated versions of the same tunes.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "October 24, 2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aetherbyte", "publishers": "Aetherbyte", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114733-insanity\n"}
