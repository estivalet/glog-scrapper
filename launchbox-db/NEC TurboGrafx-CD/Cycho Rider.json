{"altername_name": ["Cycho Rider (from Seiya Monogatari Anearth Fantasy Stories)"], "name": "Cycho Rider", "overview": "Cycho Rider is a 2-minute caravan shooting game, very similar to Hudson\u2019s entries to the Star Soldier series or Naxat\u2019s contributions to the festival shoot\u2019em up series (Nexzr or Alzadick). Cycho Rider was originally included on the Seiya Monogatari Taikenban disc, a demo CD-Rom\u00b2. It was a real shame that the game \u2013 although just being a 2-minute caravan shooter \u2013 was missing out on a proper presentation or packaging. This disc only includes Cycho Rider. The Japanese Seiya Monogatari demo has been removed, so the disc directy boots into this nice little caravan shoot\u2019em up.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Works", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/9T6gw_k4hRU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161326-cycho-rider\n"}
