{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mahjong Clinic Special", "overview": "Mahjong Clinic Special is a follow-up to Mahjong Clinic: Z\u014dkang\u014d, and has a similar theme and gameplay system. The player controls a school principal who brings female students to the hospital to do some tests. The player can then select various hospital rooms on a map; traveling to these locations triggers short conversations, which invariably lead to mahjong games against nurses, schoolgirls, patients, etc. A separate game mode is available, allowing the player to directly compete in mahjong against opponents from the story mode.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 24, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106729-mahjong-clinic-special\n"}
