{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quiz Marugoto the World", "overview": "Quiz Marugoto the World is a simple simulation of a TV trivia game. TV hosts ask questions on various topics (the questions are spoken, not displayed in text), and the correct answer must be chosen among several available ones within a time limit. The game show has three modes: \"World Quiz Trip\", championship, and cup. The first is essentially a single-player mode; the championship allows players to compete against each other, with topics randomly chosen; the cup works like any comparable sports event, including elimination rounds.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "April 5, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.I", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106801-quiz-marugoto-the-world\n"}
