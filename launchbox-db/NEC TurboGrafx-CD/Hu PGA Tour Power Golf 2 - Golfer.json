The game attempts to realistically simulate golf and contains many features and variables that influence gameplay. There are two modes in the game: Normal and Tournament. In the normal mode up to four players can compete against each other or computer opponent in stroke play, match play, driving range, and putting green. Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection, complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part of the ball the player wishes to strike. The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working or practicing golf.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 4, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106686-hu-pga-tour-power-golf-2-golfer\n"}
