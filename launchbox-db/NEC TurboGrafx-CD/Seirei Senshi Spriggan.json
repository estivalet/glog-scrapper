{"altername_name": [], "name": "Seirei Senshi Spriggan", "overview": "Take on the alien hordes in this vertically scrolling shoot 'em up from the people behind Aleste. The power-up system in Spriggan relies on different coloured globes - you can have three of these in stock at any one time and the order they are in will vary what style of weapon you have. This allows for a certain degree of mix-and-match until you find your preferred combination. You can also eject these orbs, which act as a smart bomb in times of need.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "July 12, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb5q0mXmIo4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17824-seirei-senshi-spriggan\n"}
