{"altername_name": ["Todd's Adventures in Slime World"], "name": "Slime World", "overview": "While flying your spaceship, you crash land on a planet covered entirely in slime. You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out. The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas. Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your \"friend\" to find and get to an exit first. Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete. The basis of the game is exploration, with varying game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "October 9, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx", "publishers": "Micro World", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83103-slime-world\n"}
