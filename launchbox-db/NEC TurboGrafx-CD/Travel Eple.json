{"altername_name": ["Travel Epuru"], "name": "Travel Eple", "overview": "Travel Apple is a cute puzzle/action game by Telenet and is somehow inspired by other Battle Games including Hudson Soft's famous Bomberman. Epuru, the heroine of the game, is a cute little girl in a big and cartoony penguin suit. Penguins, as you soon discover, are everywhere in this game and the action starts in the white landscapes of Antartica. She is accompanied by her pet-penguin and his cute little hat. The goal of the game is to clean up every stage during intense one-on-one fights. Various weapons can be collected and used against your opponent : clubs, metal pipes but also hand grenades and bombs. Other items, like potions, will help our heroine and give her some life back. Battle fields are also filled with special blocks and tiles, like traps, teleporters or green reviving pools. The game will take our friend to different parts of the world and affront many enemies, including crazy wales, giant shrimps, insane scientists, military freaks and finally, the evil master penguin. Travel Epuru also includes a fun two-player versus mode.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 4, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Riot", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82239-travel-eple\n"}
