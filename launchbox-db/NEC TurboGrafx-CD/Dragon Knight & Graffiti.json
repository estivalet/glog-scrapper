{"altername_name": ["Dragon Knight and Graffiti"], "name": "Dragon Knight & Graffiti", "overview": "Dragon Knight & Graffiti is the remake of the first game in the Dragon Knight series. The remake has the same story (the wandering knight Takeru has to defeat a demon who threatens a town populated only by women) and core gameplay (explore a huge dungeon full of monsters, return to the only town to buy better weapons and equipment), but features better graphics, more convenient battle interface, and voice acting. Despite the abundance of pretty girls, there are no explicit sex scenes in this game. As the name implies, the remake also has a \"graffiti mode\" (accessible from the main menu), which lets the player view all the hand-drawn pictures of the game - those of pretty girls or any other kind.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 31, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elf", "publishers": "NEC Avenue", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106665-dragon-knight-graffiti\n"}
