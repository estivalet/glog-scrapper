{"altername_name": ["Alnam no Kiba: Juuzoku Juuni Shinto Densetsu", "Arunamu no Kiba: Juuzoku Juuni Shinto Densetsu"], "name": "Alnam no Kiba: Juuzoku Juuni Shinto Densetsu", "overview": "Kenbu is a young warrior who trains in the art of shape-shifting - his people possess the ability to turn into beasts. One day, his home village is attacked by a hideous spider-like monster. Kenbu's best friend and mentor dies protecting him. The young hero kills the monster, but soon thereafter has to leave the village and find out who or what was behind that attack. Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil that is threatening the entire world. Alnam no Kiba (\"Fang of Alnam\") is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world, walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in Alshark). Every action in battle depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "December 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Right Stuff", "publishers": "Right Stuff", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlPKnO87cX4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100398-alnam-no-kiba-juuzoku-juuni-shinto-densetsu\n"}
