The hero of the game is a young pilot named Harry. He was testing the newest spacecraft model, but it crash-landed on Menaris, a planet at the outskirts of the Eva solar system, with a medieval-like civilization. Turns out that repairing the ship will be anything but easy, so Harry decides to stay for a while and to help the inhabitants of Menaris with their problems, which involve the over-ambitious Doran Empire. With the help of Aria, princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but will have to face something that threatens the entire galaxy.
