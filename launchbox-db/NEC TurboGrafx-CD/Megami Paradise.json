{"altername_name": ["Megami Tengoku"], "name": "Megami Paradise", "overview": "In a magical country where only women dwell, young girls study in a magic school to become powerful and benevolent goddesses. One day, four magical orbs fell into the hands of a student named Rin-Rin. The clumsy girl managed to lose all of them, without understanding what this could lead to: nobody knows what will happen if the orbs fall into wrong hands - those of the dark goddesses! Aided by a little fairy named Pop, Rin-Rin has to gather the legendary goddesses and to find a way to retrieve the orbs. Megami Tengoku is based on an anime of the same name (translated as Megami Paradise). It plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG with turn-based combat. Rin-Rin uses magical spells to fight enemies. An unusual feature of the game is the ability to change clothes, and the fact that every dress changes the graphical appearance of the character.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.I", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106745-megami-paradise\n"}
