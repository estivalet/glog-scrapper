{"altername_name": [], "name": "YaWaRa! 2: A Fashionable Judo Girl!", "overview": "In this sequel, the story concentrates far more on Fujiko - another judo wannabe, and you play the game from her point of view rather than photographer Matsuda's. Yawara herself is very much in the background here and not nearly as prominent as in the first game. There are a selection of bonus extras for added value. These include a quiz, character information, a cookery lesson, an unlockable game of othello and an arcade style judo battle game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 23, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mutech", "publishers": "Sofix Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UprqsJtR51w&ab_channel=%E7%86%B1%E8%A1%80%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0TV%2FNekketsuGameTV", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77226-yawara-2-a-fashionable-judo-girl\n"}
