{"altername_name": ["AV Tanjo", "AV Tanj\u014d"], "name": "AV Tanjou", "overview": "AV Tanj\u014d is a typically Japanese 'life-sim' in the same vein as Graduation, but with more explicit adult content due to it being an unlicensed Games Express release. You get to 'manage' the lives of three pretty young girls, Kotomi, Kyoko and Suzunu. You plan their month ahead by selecting various activities like aerobics, dating, showering, relaxing etc but must be mindful of the statistics on the right hand side of the screen. Certain activities can lower some stats while raising others, so choose with care. After each month, you get a girl chosen at random and can give them something extra (like a present) to keep them happy.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "February 24, 1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Games Express", "publishers": "Game Express", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyvRwAnG3I0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100401-av-tanjou\n"}
