Work your way up each level by jumping platforms and throwing out rainbows. You can collapse your rainbows by jumping on them from above, allowing you to destroy any enemies trapped underneath, or you can shoot them directly at anything heading your way. The rainbows can be powered up to shoot three at a time and are essential to use as temporary platforms to progress up the level.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "June 30, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "NEC Avenue", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Islands:_The_Story_of_Bubble_Bobble_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTebxL8Af-Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74126-rainbow-islands-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-2\n"}
