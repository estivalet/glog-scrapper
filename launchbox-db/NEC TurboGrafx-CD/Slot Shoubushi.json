{"altername_name": ["Slot Gambler"], "name": "Slot Shoubushi", "overview": "Slot Gambler follows the story of a young man who finds himself miraculously teleported to a wondrous land consisting of nine islands. Each island contains casino houses run by attractive, scantily clad women. The player navigates the protagonist on the overhead island map, visiting casino houses and playing various slot machines until the winning requirements are met to continue the journey. Some locations lead to puzzle mini-games, encounters with women who give the hero erotic pictures of themselves, etc. The female characters in the game are digitized photos of real people. Though suggestive themes are used, there is no explicit nudity or sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "April 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cream", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106835-slot-shoubushi\n"}
