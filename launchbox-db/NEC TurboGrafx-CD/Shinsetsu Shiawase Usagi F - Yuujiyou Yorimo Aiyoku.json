{"altername_name": ["Shinsetsu Shiawase Usagi f: Yuujou yorimo Aiyoku"], "name": "Shinsetsu Shiawase Usagi F: Yuujiyou Yorimo Aiyoku", "overview": "This installment of Shiawase Usagi abandons the heroines of the two previous games in favor of characters curiously named after Neon Genesis Evangelion heroes: the protagonist is called Shinji, the love interests Misato and Asuka, etc. The plot, however, has little to do with that of the anime series: the hero is a horny young man (aren't we all?) who is watching a porn movie and decides to get some real \"action\". Afterwards, it becomes a series of sexual encounters, which proceed depending on the player's choices. Being a visual novel, the game can develop into different directions story-wise. The only gameplay consists of deciding where to go and/or what to do. Depending on the player's decisions, the story will be concluded with various endings, \"happy\" as well as \"bad.\"", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "October 9, 1997", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B-Project", "publishers": "Rabbit Soft Kenky\u016bsho", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114753-shinsetsu-shiawase-usagi-f-yuujiyou-yorimo-aiyoku\n"}
