{"altername_name": ["Hyaku Monogatari: Honto ni Atta Kowai Hanashi"], "name": "Hyaku Monogatari: Hontou ni Atta Kowai Hanashi", "overview": "Its sub-title translated as True Scary Stories, Hyaku Monogatari is a video game homage to the parlour game Hyaku Monogatari Kaidankai, which was popular during the Edo period (17th - middle of 19th century) in Japan. The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark. The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "August 4, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106687-hyaku-monogatari-hontou-ni-atta-kowai-hanashi\n"}
