{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ai Chou Aniki", "overview": "The Cho Aniki series returns with their first sequel, the one that would cement the series humorous fetish with bodybuilders and other assorted stuff. As in the original Cho Aniki: Super Big Brothers, Ai Cho Aniki is a side-scrolling shooter in which you have to clear several stages of enemies with your flying avatar. Said avatar this time can be either of the two \"option\" bodybuilders that were supporting characters in the original while the original's main cast plays only small cameo roles as they appear every now and then to drop power-ups. Our two beloved speedo-wearing beefcakes also incorporate different play mechanics, as their attacks are often determined by button combinations (as in fighting games) which put a spin on the gameplay. Otherwise, the game's graphics and design are practically identical to the first game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "February 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits Laboratory", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24131-ai-chou-aniki\n"}
