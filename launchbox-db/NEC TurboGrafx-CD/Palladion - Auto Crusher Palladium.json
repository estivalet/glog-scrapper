{"altername_name": [], "name": "Palladion: Auto Crusher Palladium", "overview": "Auto Crusher Palladium is a game that simulates construction of battle robots (\"mechs\"). The player is able to construct robots using various parts: body, limbs, computer AI, weapons, etc. The result can be a combination of any forms and components, with the limitation being the overall weight of the robot, which must not exceed a specified amount. Robots can be humanoid, machine-like, rolling on wheels, able to fly or transform into different forms, etc. After a robot has been created, the player sends it to fight other robots. The battles look like those of a fighting game, with side-scrolling view and HP bars; however, they are non-interactive. The entire gameplay focus in on creating a robot in such a way that it would be able to defeat a particular enemy; the battles themselves allow no control from the side of the player. A \"league mode\" is also available, where the player(s) choose various models of robots and have them compete against each other in a tournament.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "February 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Office Koukan", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106756-palladion-auto-crusher-palladium\n"}
