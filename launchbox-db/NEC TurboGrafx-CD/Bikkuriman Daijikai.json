{"altername_name": ["Bikkuri Man Daijikai"], "name": "Bikkuriman Daijikai", "overview": "Based on a manga/anime character, Bikkuri Man Daijikai is less a game, more an encyclopedia of information. You start off with a map screen, and upon selecting the first location, you are presented with the standard information screen which consists of an image, character information (all in Japanese of course), a book to flick to the next image and a couple of other options. Clicking on the image or on its icon beneath it can bring up more characters to look at, and sometimes clicking on a part of the image brings up a description of that part. At various times a quiz screen will appear and you'll have to answer a question to proceed. As you progress, the amulet on the right will gradually build up and selecting this takes you to another screen with bonus pictures.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "December 23, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100402-bikkuriman-daijikai\n"}
