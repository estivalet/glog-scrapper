{"altername_name": ["Cosmic Fantasy 2"], "name": "Cosmic Fantasy 2: Bouken Shounen Ban", "overview": "Van is a young boy who lives on the planet Idea, a place where technology has not yet reached a high level. One day his sweetheart Laura gets kidnapped by an unknown villain. Van soon discovers that Laura possesses mysterious powers that may grant immortality to the one who marries her. That is exactly what the evil wizard Galam has in mind. Van sets off to rescue Laura, on a quest that involves intergalactic journeys and travel through time. Cosmic Fantasy 2 is a sequel to Cosmic Fantasy: B\u014dken Sh\u014dnen Yuu, and the only installment in the series to have been released in the West. Though initially not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, the game features several common characters and themes. Like the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks. Characters join and leave the party frequently, as dictated by the plot; the party may contain up to four active combatants. Story progression and overworld exploration is linear; dungeons are usually fairly complex and maze-like. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story of the game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "April 5, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Telenet Japan", "publishers": "Working Designs", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.22", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Fantasy_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9608-cosmic-fantasy-2-bouken-shounen-ban\n"}
