{"altername_name": ["Tengai Makyou: Deden no Kabuki-den"], "name": "Tengai Makyou: Deden no Den", "overview": "Bomberman '94 Special Version was a limited edition game with approximately 10,000 copies produced and only given away through Hudson's newsletter and at one of their caravan tournament site, apparently (source). The release date is unknown, but one can assume it came out before the retail release. Deden no Den was released the following year, and is near-enough the exact same game. All the Bombermen have been replaced with Kabuki Denjirou, a character from the Tengai Makyou / Far East of Eden RPG series (most of which were co-developed and published by Hudson Soft). Note: you can't change the other players to CPU, it's exclusively human opponents only.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Red Company", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99490-tengai-makyou-deden-no-den\n"}
