{"altername_name": ["Quiz Avenue 2"], "name": "Quiz Avenue II", "overview": "Quiz Avenue II, like its predecessor, is a quiz game with a story-driven quest mode, which continues the plot of the first game. After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition; however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by the queen to stop them. The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called \"F1 Grand Prix\", which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "October 11, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mutech", "publishers": "NEC Avenue", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106796-quiz-avenue-ii\n"}
