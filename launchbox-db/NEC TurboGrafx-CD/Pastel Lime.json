{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pastel Lime", "overview": "Y\u016b is a young apprentice magician who lives in the Fairy World. One day, a magical error occurs, and Y\u016b finds herself on Earth. In order to return to her world, the little fairy must find three stones that must be inserted into her magical brooch. A young girl who finds the first stone becomes Y\u016b's companion (and the game's protagonist), and together they must find and recover the other stones. Pastel Lime is a Japanese-style adventure with simple gameplay. Only a few commands (sometimes just one) usually appear on the screen, and the player's input is mostly reduced to selecting these commands several times to trigger the next scene. Sub-menus (such as conversation topics) may appear as well. Game progression is strictly linear, and the player has no choice of selecting locations to travel to.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106757-pastel-lime\n"}
