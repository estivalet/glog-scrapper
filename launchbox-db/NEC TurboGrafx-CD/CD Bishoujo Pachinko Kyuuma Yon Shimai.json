The player controls a nameless protagonist who finds himself in a casino and has to win enough money to view animations of young warrior women removing their clothes in style. There are several types of pachinko machines, though they all follow the same basic formula: the player has to adjust the strength of the shot in order to send the ball through, accumulating jewels which are then automatically exchanged for money. When the player has gathered a sufficient amount of money he is allowed to watch the girl's undressing stage.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Game Express", "publishers": "Game Express", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106649-cd-bishoujo-pachinko-kyuuma-yon-shimai\n"}
