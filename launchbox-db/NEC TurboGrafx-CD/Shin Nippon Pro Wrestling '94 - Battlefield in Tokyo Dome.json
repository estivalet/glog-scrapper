{"altername_name": ["Battle Field '94 in Tokyo Dome", "Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling '94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome"], "name": "Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome", "overview": "Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome is a 1994 New Japan Pro Wrestling game for the Super Famicom and PC Engine CD-ROM. It features multiple wrestlers active on the NJPW roster at the time, including both native and foreign talent. Like its predecessor Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling: Chou Senshi in Tokyo Dome (and its successor, Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '95: Tokyo Dome Battle 7), the ring is depicted from a side view as wrestlers walk in from the two sides to start each bout. The player can select between the Battlefield in Tokyo Dome event, the G1 Climax event (both of which are major annual events for the promotion), an IGWP Heavyweight Championship bout (a belt considered the highest accolade within NJPW) and a standalone versus battle. The Battlefield and Versus modes also allow for tag teams and multiple players.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "November 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Varie", "publishers": "Fujicom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/kNB3QwQMcZU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110256-shin-nippon-pro-wrestling-94-battlefield-in-tokyo-dome\n"}
