{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sotsugyou Shashin: Miki", "overview": "This enhanced version of the earlier computer release allows the player to play either of the games directly from the main menu. Both games feature some re-drawn artwork and remixed soundtrack, as well as voice-overs that were not present in the computer versions. The protagonists' names have been changed to Naoki Muraoka (Sotsugy\u014d Shashin) and Tetsuya Watanabe (Miki). While the gameplay of Miki remains largely unchanged, this version of Sotsugy\u014d Shashin allows the player to choose Hiromi Kamura as the protagonist, which adds a second scenario to the game where the same events are presented from her point of view. The gameplay system has underwent a few tweaks, making some of the player's choices influence the course of the story. While the original game only had one ending, this version has seven endings for Naoki's scenario and ten for Hiromi's.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "October 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Coconuts Japan Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106841-sotsugyou-shashin-miki\n"}
