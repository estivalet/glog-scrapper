{"altername_name": [], "name": "Babel", "overview": "In the distant future, human beings invented space warps, which allowed space travel to long distances. On board the space ship Agamemnon, they started an intergalactic journey. But an accident happened, and the humans were thrown into a parallel universe. Years have passed until they have adapted themselves to the different civilization. This parallel world, composed of three huge continents, is called Babel. Zell is a teenage boy, an orphan who lives in a post-apocalyptic world riding his bike, together with his friend Alice, who is like a big sister to him. One day they meet a mysterious girl named Sefia who seems to be on an important mission. Their struggle against evil begins at that moment... Babel is a Japanese-style RPG set in a futuristic world. Zell and his party travel around the world, visiting large cities and encountering many randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, each character can use a variety of attacks with different weapons, as well as special techniques. The combat window shows animated moves of the party members. Unlike in most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points from defeating enemies; only money is gained. The characters level up according to the player's progress in the narrative.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shin-Nihon Laser Soft", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99bsq9FIjNE&ab_channel=Japaneseretrogames", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77256-babel\n"}
