{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mitsubachi Gakuen", "overview": "Mitsubachi Gakuen is an adventure game in which the player takes the role of a teacher in the Mitsubachi Academy, entrusted with the task of helping its female students to reach stardom by monitoring their studies and activities. The game is divided into four seasons, each with a sub-plot of its own (e.g. preparing to a competition with another school and handling intrusive journalists and possible spies), and each dealing with a team of five different girls. The player can check the dossier of all the twenty students at any time and learn more about them. The game features digitized photos of real people instead of the more common anime-style character graphics. Gameplay-wise, the game features a traditional menu containing verb commands for examining the environment, talking to characters, checking the inventory, moving to another location, etc.; most of these verbs lead to a list of possible objects to interact with. There are no puzzles, but a few instances require the player to make the right choices in order to continue the game; in other cases it is possible to slightly branch the plot by making a decision.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 14, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106746-mitsubachi-gakuen\n"}
