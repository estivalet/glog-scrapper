{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metal Angel", "overview": "Metal Angel is a managerial simulation game that takes place in the futuristic society of 2014, where battles between fighters in mechanized suits have become a major sports event. The player takes control of a coach who must train five young women of different backgrounds, all of which aspire to become a professional fighter. The coach's statistics are generated by answering a series of questions in the beginning of the game. Each of the girl also has her own statistics that must be carefully monitored. With the exception of automatized events, the game consists of creating schedules for all the girls for one week in advance, and then watching how their attributes change. Activities include battle training, gymnastics, running, resting, etc. All the activities are displayed as small animated segments on the same screen.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 24, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Radical Plan", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29799-metal-angel\n"}
