{"altername_name": ["Metal Angel II"], "name": "Metal Angel 2", "overview": "The follow-up to Metal Angel is, like its predecessor, a managerial simulation in which the player character trains young girls to become champions of a fighting championship where participants don mechanized power suits. The player controls a manager rather than a coach in this installment, and must keep an eye on the finances as a result. Also, instead of training all the five girls from the first game, the player's answers to the questions posed by the assistant in the beginning of the game determine the choice of the trainee among the same five characters. The player must make schedules for the fighter, which include various training and recreational activities. The manager can hire coaches with their own programs, or input activities individually. The battles themselves allow little input, with the player being able to choose between various types of attacks by selecting them from a menu; the outcome of the battle largely depends on training and individual statistics.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "January 20, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Radical Plan", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29800-metal-angel-2\n"}
