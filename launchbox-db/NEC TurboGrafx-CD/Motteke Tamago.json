{"altername_name": [], "name": "Motteke Tamago", "overview": "You control a cute little duck walking around a maze, collecting eggs and powerups. When your eggs hatch, they head for your home, and bring you points (sometimes bonus points too). Of course, you can always disrupt the efforts of the other players, and there are other perils in the game. So, the object of the game is basically to hatch the most eggs & get the chicks to your home before anyone else... There are 3 worlds, each containing 10 levels which are all selectable at anytime... The game follows much the same look & feel as the Bomberman series, similarly, it allows up to 4 simultaneous players for multi-barrels of fun.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "April 16, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "Tokuma Shoten Intermedia", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33183-motteke-tamago\n"}
