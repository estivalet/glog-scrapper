His parents aren't at home, and he invites his girlfriend with only one goal in his mind... If you guessed \"discuss with her Schopenhauer's philosophy and the conflict in the Middle East\", you're wrong. The young man wants to \"score\" with the girl, which effectively sums up the game's entire narrative. The seduction process is almost completely automated; all the player has to do is to choose the command icons (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Touch\", etc.) repeatedly until the next scene is triggered. There are no dead ends, no \"Game Over\", and no challenge and/or branching events whatsoever in the game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B-Project", "publishers": "Office Asia Kenky\u016bsho", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114751-shiawase-usagi-happy-rabbit\n"}
