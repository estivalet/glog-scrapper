{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quiz de Gakuensai", "overview": "Quiz de Gakuensai is a trivia game in which the player takes the role of a high school student. One day he is entrusted with an important task of watching over his relative, a little girl. However, as soon as his girlfriend appears, the hero neglects his duty and very soon finds out that the little girl has disappeared. He has to explore the school building and find her at all costs. The player can choose the order in which the protagonist visits various classrooms in the school. In each room there is a young and attractive girl who asks the hero a series of timed trivia questions on different topics (predominantly popular culture). Both the protagonist and the girls have certain amounts of hit points; a correct answer diminishes the opponent's HP by one, while a wrong one depletes the protagonist's health by the same amount.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "November 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106800-quiz-de-gakuensai\n"}
