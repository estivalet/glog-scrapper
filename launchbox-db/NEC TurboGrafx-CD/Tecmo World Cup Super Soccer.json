{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tecmo World Cup Super Soccer", "overview": "Tecmo World Cup Super Soccer is quite different from the similarly-named Tecmo World Cup Soccer. In this football (soccer) game players can choose between competing for the World Cup or participating in the Japanese league tournament. Only eight international teams (Brazil, Argentine, Japan, England, France, Spain, Italy, and Germany) are available. Before a match begins players can choose between three general strategies for the team - normal, offensive, or defensive. Weather conditions (normal, rain, or snow) and match length can be selected as well. The game itself is played from a third-person perspective that slightly switches between isometric and top-down depending on the situation.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "December 4, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Rings", "publishers": "Media Rings", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83110-tecmo-world-cup-super-soccer\n"}
