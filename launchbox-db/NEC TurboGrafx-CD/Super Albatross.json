{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Albatross", "overview": "Super Albatross is a golf game. There are three modes available: training, match play, and tournament. Match play is essentially a story mode that casts the player in the role of a young man whose mother has passed away and who tries to find solace in golf. In this mode, opponents must be defeated in a linear fashion and courses are dictated by the story. In training and tournament modes the player can choose between six different courses. The tournament mode is a competition between various characters who appeared as opponents in the match play mode. The golf game itself is viewed from a top-down perspective at all times, and allows the player to choose the type of club as well as adjust the angle and the strength of the shot.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 14, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Shin-Nihon Laser Soft", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83109-super-albatross\n"}
