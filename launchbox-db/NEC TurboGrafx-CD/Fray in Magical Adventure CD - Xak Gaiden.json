{"altername_name": ["In Magical Adventure: Fray CD - Xak Gaiden"], "name": "Fray in Magical Adventure CD: Xak Gaiden", "overview": "This version of Fray in Magical Adventure differs from the original MSX and subsequent computer releases in several ways. It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Cabin", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fray_in_Magical_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24355-fray-in-magical-adventure-cd-xak-gaiden\n"}
