{"altername_name": [], "name": "Builderland: The Story of Melba", "overview": "Another western game converted to the PC Engine by Micro World, Builderland has a concept similar to the infamous Lemmings, and requires equally sharp forethought and reactions. The aim is to escort your little buddy across the vast playing area without him getting stuck, burned up, eaten by sheep etc. To do this, you can pick up and move various items that are scattered around the landscape, such as blocks to fill in gaps or create handy slopes, bombs to destroy areas of the map and so on. All this time your red headed friend is moving forward with alarming rapidity towards his doom. Thankfully, you can freeze the action to give yourself some breathing space to juggle things around, but this is limited to a timer which counts down slowly at the top of the screen.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "April 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciel", "publishers": "Micro World", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75654-builderland-the-story-of-melba\n"}
