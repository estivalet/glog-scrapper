{"altername_name": [], "name": "Meteor Blaster DX", "overview": "Meteor Blaster DX is a homebrew Asteroids variant. The player controls a spaceship navigated by an astronaut named Stryker, who is sent on a mission to destroy dangerous asteroids in space. There are four different ships to choose from, each with different power and speed ratings. The player can move the ship and rotate its cannon to shoot asteroids. Big and medium asteroids split in two when shot, and only when they are small they can be fully destroyed. A stage is completed when all the asteroids have been eliminated. All the stages take place on the same screen, but feature different enemies and difficulty level. The DX version is a physical release of a previous download-only version, and includes hostile UFOs that shoot at the player-controlled ship, boss battles, CD audio soundtrack, and power-ups that temporarily grant shields and other bonuses. Also included on the CD is a timed mode (\"Caravan Mode\") of Implode, as well as the puzzle game Loop, which was previously only released in emulator-only downloadable format and requires the player to rotate and construct loops out of pipe pieces that gradually fill up the screen, making them disappear.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MindRec", "publishers": "MindRec", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105545-meteor-blaster-dx\n"}
