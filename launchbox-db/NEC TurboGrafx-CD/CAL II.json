{"altername_name": [], "name": "CAL II", "overview": "You are Wataru Ishibashi, a high-school student in modern Japan. Up until recently you led a normal life, enjoying the relationship with your lovely girlfriend Mika. But short before the graduation ceremony, you had a strange vision that you first believe to be a dream. But when you are contacted by Venus, the goddess of love, you realise Mika was abducted by Aeon, the goddess of time, and transferred into the Realm of Time. You must now travel to the legendary dream world of beautiful goddesses and bring Mika back. Cal II plays like a Japanese-style adventure game with visual novel elements. You read the text and sometimes are able to choose between various actions. In addition, there is a \"world map\" on which you navigate your character from a top-down view, visiting different locations in an order you prefer. The game features voice-overs for the dialogues.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 31, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Birdy Soft", "publishers": "NEC Avenue", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100405-cal-ii\n"}
