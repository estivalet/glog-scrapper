{"altername_name": ["Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Vol. II", "Sherlock Holmes no Tantei Kouza II", "Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Volume II"], "name": "Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Volume 2", "overview": "The game uses live actors and sets as the player controls Sherlock Holmes and his longtime partner Dr. Watson, trying to solve three separate crimes by visiting various locations, listening to the dialogue, reading the included mock London newspapers, and, when the player gets enough evidence, answering the judge's questions. At the beginning of each case a full motion video clip depicts Holmes and Watson meeting a client and learning a few background clues about the case. Then the player must visit a particular location or person, read the London newspapers for clues or ask one of the young Baker Street Irregulars to investigate. The object of each case is to gather enough clues in the shortest time possible, then go before a judge who will then ask the player to answer the important questions about the case. If the player is successful, a full motion video clip will take the player back to Holmes' and Watson's study where they will review the events that transpired, and Dr. Watson will inform the player of his or her score, based on the length of time it took to solve the case.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "May 28, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ICOM Simulations", "publishers": "Victor Musical Industries", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes:_Consulting_Detective_Vol._II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mehj592DwI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9627-sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-volume-2\n"}
