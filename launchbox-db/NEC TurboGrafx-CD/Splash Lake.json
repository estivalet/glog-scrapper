{"altername_name": ["Splash Lake: Ostrich Daibouken"], "name": "Splash Lake", "overview": "Splash Lake is an action-puzzle game for the TurboGrafx-CD and PC Engine CD-ROM. The player is an ostrich named Ozzie and must walk around a grid, pecking at certain lynchpin areas of the ground in order to collapse parts of the level into the ocean. The goal is to remove all enemies by dropping the ground they're walking on. It is structurally similar to Dig Dug 2. The game has a multiplayer mode, which allows two players to try to outmaneuver and out-think each other.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "June 28, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits Laboratory", "publishers": "Turbo Technologies", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9628-splash-lake\n"}
