{"altername_name": ["Lodoss Tou Senki"], "name": "Record of Lodoss War", "overview": "The game is based on the novel cycle Record of Lodoss War by Ryo Mizuno, and more closely on subsequent manga volumes and OVA series. Its story generally follows the one of the OVA, the main hero being Parn, a young man who grows up in a small village and later becomes one of the strongest warriors in the world, thanks to his father's mysterious heritage and his own courage. Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure. This version of Record of Lodoss War is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "July 17, 1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Humming Bird Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_Lodoss_War", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40451-record-of-lodoss-war\n"}
