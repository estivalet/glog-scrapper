{"altername_name": [], "name": "IQ Panic", "overview": "IQ Panic is a quiz game with a background story. A demon has kidnapped a girl from a peaceful village, and the elders send a boy named Gengor\u014d to bring her back, defeating the demon's minions using his intelligence and knowledge. The game has a pseudo-RPG structure, with top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, treasure chests, random and boss \"battles\", etc. However, real RPG elements are very light in the game: there is no leveling up, and the protagonist's health increases automatically following a plot-dictated boss encounter. The core of the gameplay are the trivia \"battles\" against randomly appearing characters. Each \"enemy\" will ask the hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the question correctly within the time limit will \"kill\" the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's HP by one point. Boss enemies offer a choice of topics and take several correct answers to defeat. A few items can be used to restore HP, reduce the time limit, return to a town, etc.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "February 21, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "International Games System", "publishers": "International Games System", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106691-iq-panic\n"}
