{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mamono Hunter Youko: Makai Kara no Tenkousei", "overview": "Makai kara no Tenk\u014dsei is based on the anime series Devil Hunter Yohko. The anime focuses on Yohko Mano, a Japanese high school student who discovers that she is the 108th Devil Hunter, destined to fight supernatural evil beings in accordance with her legacy. The game puts the player in the role of Shoma, a new exchange student who meets Yohko and her best friend Chikako at his new school. Miraculously, the three are teleported into a parallel dimension, and the reluctant hero discovers, to his amazement, that its inhabitants seem to be familiar with him. The game plays like a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a menu of verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, and Move) at nearly every screen, some leading to object lists. It is often necessary to go through the commands several times to unlock a new one or trigger events. Limited menu-based navigation is also present.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 13, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TamTam Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106740-mamono-hunter-youko-makai-kara-no-tenkousei\n"}
