{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quiz Caravan Cult Q", "overview": "Quiz Caravan: Cult Q is a trivia game with four modes. The main mode involves a quiz competition in which players can choose the topics of the questions, e.g. movies, video games, history, etc. Up to five players can participate in this mode or compete against the computer AI. The \"adventure mode\" is a board game in which the player-controlled character's movement is determined by a dice roll. Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the final field on each stage is a more challenging \"boss battle\". Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit. Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a board, while the opponent is pushed back. All modes feature characters from other games published by Hudson Soft, such as Bomberman or Tengai Maky\u014d series.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "May 28, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AlfaSystem", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106799-quiz-caravan-cult-q\n"}
