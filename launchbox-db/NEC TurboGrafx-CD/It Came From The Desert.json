{"altername_name": [], "name": "It Came From The Desert", "overview": "It Came from the Desert is a remake of the the original 1989 Amiga game of the same name, but with a vast amount of changes and improvements. The basic setting was kept identical. It is a mix of action and adventure elements, largely inspired from cult-horror B-Movies of the 50's and 60's, and the 1954 film Them in particular. The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "NEC Technologies", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Came_from_the_Desert", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvhQYj98xk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9580-it-came-from-the-desert\n"}
