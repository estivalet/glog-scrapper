{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol. 2", "overview": "Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.2 is a direct sequel to the first episode based on the Gunbuster anime series. It continues the story started in the first chapter, following the adventures of the young mecha pilot Noriko Takaya as she passes the test and is admitted into the fighting squad of mechas, sent on a mission to stop an insectoid race of aliens from destroying the Earth. Gameplay-wise, the second episode differs from the previous one in that it eschews even the rudimentary Japanese-style adventure commands. It plays more like a pure interactive movie: the player watches animated, voiced scenes and from time to time has to make a decision for Noriko, influencing subsequent scenes. The \"stress meter\" from the preceding game has been removed as well. The game also contains extras such as character and robot introduction, a radio drama, and a \"rock-paper-scissors\" game against Noriko.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Riverhill Soft", "publishers": "Riverhill Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106875-top-o-nerae-gunbuster-vol-2\n"}
