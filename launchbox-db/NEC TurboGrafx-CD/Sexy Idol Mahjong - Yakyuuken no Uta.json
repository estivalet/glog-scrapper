{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sexy Idol Mahjong: Yakyuuken no Uta", "overview": "Yaky\u016bken no Uta is, like other games in the series, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese actresses. There is no story in the game; players can simply choose to compete either in four- or two-player mahjong tournaments, selecting individual participants or teams from a list. The game also contains a third mode which has nothing to do with mahjong: players select actresses who then begin to dance; players have to press buttons at the right moment to execute dancing moves. Actresses appear topless in these dances.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "January 31, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cream", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106832-sexy-idol-mahjong-yakyuuken-no-uta\n"}
