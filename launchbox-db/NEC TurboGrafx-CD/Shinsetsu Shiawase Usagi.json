{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shinsetsu Shiawase Usagi", "overview": "The first of the follow-ups to the two Shiawase Usagi games is a completely pornographic product, consisting of a drawn-out threesome sex scene between two high school girls, the child-like Mary and the more \"mature\" Yuki, and the nameless protagonist. Unlike the previous game, the entire procedure here is consensual. The gameplay abandons the Japanese adventure format with its verb icons, becoming instead a very simple, very short visual novel with just a few choices the player can make between non-interactive text and pictures. Some of these choices lead to the Game Over screen.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "September 1, 1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B-Project", "publishers": "Rabbit Soft Kenky\u016bsho", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114752-shinsetsu-shiawase-usagi\n"}
