The game has various scenarios from the Conquest of Mongolia (the unification of Mongol tribes) to World Conquest (with up to six playable factions). On the world/country map (divided into smaller provinces) the player develops his own provinces, gives orders to his subordinates, establishes alliances and recruits armies.
