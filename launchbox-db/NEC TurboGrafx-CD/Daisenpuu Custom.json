{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daisenpuu Custom", "overview": "Daisenpuu Custom can be described as a remixed version of the HuCard game released in 1989. The game is based on the arcade shooter of the same name released by Taito/Toaplan in 1987 (also known as Twin Hawk). The players takes control of a World War II plane and fights his way through a vast array of enemy air defenses such as tanks, submarines and battle ships (curiously, there aren't any enemy planes in the game). Our fighter plane can use a classic Vulcan gun and a special, but limited, bomb attack. The latter calls a formation of friendly planes that will shoot at will until they eventually get hit. Pressing the bomb button twice triggers a powerful smart-bomb and wipes out most of the enemies on screen. A standard power-up system upgrades the plane throughout the game - destroying tiny truck usually frees up power-icons. Some, stamped with a large character P on them, upgrade the plane's main gun up to four times. Others give away extra bombs or rare extra lives.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "July 26, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Hawk", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32757-daisenpuu-custom\n"}
