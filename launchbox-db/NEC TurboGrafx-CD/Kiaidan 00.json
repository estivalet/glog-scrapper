{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kiaidan 00", "overview": "You take control of a flying robot through seven massive stages. Fight against armies of flying insectoid enemies and other space ships and humanoid robots. The game designs are really similar to early Sunrise animations or Toei classic japanese series like Mazinga Z and Grandizer. Your robot can use different sort of weaponery, from standard blue spreading bullets, to green laser waves and even a sort of 'yoyo' attack. Stages have a standard structure with quite big end of level bosses. Your main weapon can also be charged and trigger a powerful and destructive attack. Use it to finish a boss and unfold a different inbetween level animation sequence !", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "October 23, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AlfaSystem", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34145-kiaidan-00\n"}
