{"altername_name": ["Tekipaki Working Love: Hataraku Shoujo"], "name": "Hataraku Shoujo: Tekipaki Working Love", "overview": "Tekipaki: Working Love is a simulation game somewhat similar to Graduation series, but with a much less complex system and \"working girls\" instead of students. The game's graphics were drawn by the manga artist Izumi Takemoto. The setting is 23rd century, and the player has to take care of three girls from different planets: Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt. The goal is to make the girls successfully perform their working duties (mostly secretary-like assignments), at the same time having free time to rest. With each activity, certain parameters (stamina, intelligence, etc.) of the girl will increase and decrease. Since the three girls have different parameters from the beginning, it is important to understand their personalities and to find the right balance between work and leisure. The girls also have a \"loyalty\" parameter, that usually increases when the player lets them have a day off.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "March 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio Offside", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106860-hataraku-shoujo-tekipaki-working-love\n"}
