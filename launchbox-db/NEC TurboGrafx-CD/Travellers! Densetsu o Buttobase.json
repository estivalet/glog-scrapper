{"altername_name": [], "name": "Travellers! Densetsu o Buttobase", "overview": "The most famous story of the heroic past is called \"Knights of Legend\". It is a story about heroes who have descended into hell, defeated the Demon King, and saved the seven worlds from grave peril. This story is now taught in all the schools for young adventurers, who wish to become heroes and defeat the minions of hell once and for all. Those who have already graduated are called \"travelers\"; four of them are the heroes of the game - two young men and two young women. Led by the reckless swordsman Ufuru, the travelers begin to roam the land in search of adventure... The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG. The player always controls the party of four heroes; the two men use sword techniques, one of the girls specializes in offensive magic, while the other one is a healer. The player navigates the party over the \"world map\", visiting towns and descending into dungeons. Randomly appearing enemies are fought in turn-based style. Leveling up is automatic, like in most games of the kind. There is a day/night cycle in the game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-CD", "release_date": "December 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Victor Entertainment", "publishers": "Victor Entertainment", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106876-travellers-densetsu-o-buttobase\n"}
