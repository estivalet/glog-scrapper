{"altername_name": ["Pocket Monsters Sun", "Pok\u00e9mon Sole", "Pokemon Sun", "Pok\u00e9mon Sol", "Pok\u00e9mon Sonne"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Sun", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Sun, along with Pok\u00e9mon Moon, marks the start of the seventh generation of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise. The game takes place in the Alola region, an archipelago whose culture, geography, and native wildlife are based on those of Hawaii. A number of Alola's native Pok\u00e9mon have never been seen before, bringing the series' total number of Pok\u00e9mon species to over 800. As usual for a new pair of Pok\u00e9mon games, Sun and Moon boast a number of new and improved features. HMs are now replaced by Ride Pok\u00e9mon, which are unlocked over the course of the story and can be called upon at any time to provide transportation and clear obstacles. Hyper Training allows players to boost their Pok\u00e9mon's individual values, hidden values that impact a Pok\u00e9mon's potential for stat growth and are otherwise immutable. The new Battle Royal mode pits four trainers against each other in a free-for-all fight where the goal is to score the most KOs while trying not to let one's own Pok\u00e9mon faint. A group of islands called Pok\u00e9 Pelago allow the player's Pok\u00e9mon to play and collect items while they aren't in the active party, and each island can be upgraded to provide more and better rewards. Lastly, a location called the Festival Plaza acts as the multiplayer hub, and combines features from prior games' Join Avenue and PSS systems.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "November 18, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Game Freak", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sun_and_Moon", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Iylfh-7uQkc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69662-pokemon-sun\n"}
