{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yo-Kai Watch 3: Tempura", "overview": "Yo-kai Watch 3 is a role-playing video game developed and published by Level-5 for the Nintendo 3DS. As indicated by the name, it is the third game of the main series of Yo-kai Watch video games, initially released in two versions, branded Sushi and Tempura in Japan in July 2016. A third version of the game, branded Sukiyaki, was released in Japan in December 2016, adding minor enhancements upon the original versions of the game. An English version based on Sukiyaki was released in PAL regions in December 2018, and in North America two months later. Yo-kai Watch 3 is the first mainline Yo-kai Watch game not to be localized in Korean. The game follows the interconnected stories of two protagonists who both possess watches allowing them to see, befriend, and summon Japanese mythical spirits called yo-kai: Nathan Adams, a boy who recently moved to the fictitious Southern United States city of St. Peanutsburg, and Hailey Anne Thomas, a self-styled otaku \"outcast\" who deals with yo-kai in the upstate city of Springdale. Unlike the first two games, the player is not given a choice to select Katie Forester as the protagonist instead of Nathan Adams.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104792-yo-kai-watch-3-tempura\n"}
