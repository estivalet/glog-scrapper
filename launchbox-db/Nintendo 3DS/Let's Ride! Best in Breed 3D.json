Best in Breed 3D on the 3DS, players hold their horses, in the palms of their hands, with the 3DS debut of THQ's Let's Ride pet simulation series. The stable has a choice of 25 horse breeds, and every horse has its own preferences and personality. Players wash, feed, and train their horses in a selection of eight mini-games, each with multiple levels of play. The game's \"Gyro Challenge\" makes use of the handheld's orientation awareness, as players steer their horses by moving the 3DS handheld in space. An augmented reality game makes the horse appear to be right beside the player. StreetPass features allow for on-the-spot virtual beauty competitions, which unlock additional options for both passing Best in Breed 3D players.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "September 26, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SDP Games", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95065-lets-ride-best-in-breed-3d\n"}
