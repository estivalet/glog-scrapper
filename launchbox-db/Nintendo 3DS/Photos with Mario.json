The player puts special Mario-themed AR cards into the view of the camera, and the characters represented by the cards will appear. The cards can then be removed and the character will stay. Placing multiple cards will cause the characters to interact with one another, and placing a regular ? Block card will result in a warp pipe appearing, and what emerges depends on the character present. The player can also make special effects happen on the screen. Six separate cards have been released, including Mario, Princess Peach, Goomba, Koopa Troopa, Luigi, and Bowser.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "April 23, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96866-photos-with-mario\n"}
