{"altername_name": [], "name": "Captain America: Super Soldier", "overview": "Captain America: Super Soldier combines a highly athletic combat system with fluid platforming and a highly tuned suite of shield attacks, as Cap explores a massive castle turned military installation. His shield can be employed in numerous ways: taking out multiple enemies at once, deflecting incoming fire back at enemies, solving puzzles, and scaling walls. Players will be able to launch shield-first into the fray with the superior force of the world's first Super-Soldier at their fingertips and they'll need every bit of that strength to overcome a castle that's both an acrobatic playground for the Captain's physical prowess and a house of mystery with enemies and danger at every turn.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "October 25, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "High Voltage Software", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Super_Soldier", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yO0YKz8EeM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12343-captain-america-super-soldier\n"}
