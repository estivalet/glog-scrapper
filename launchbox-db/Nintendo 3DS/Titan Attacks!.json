{"altername_name": [], "name": "Titan Attacks!", "overview": "Invaders from Titan have arrived to wreak havoc upon Earth. It's up to a single fighter ship to destroy their attacking forces, drive them off of Earth and chase them back to Titan. Titan Attacks is a fairly straightforward Space Invaders clone where the player controls and shoots from a horizontally mobile cannon while configurations of enemy aliens scroll down and try to shoot you back. There are 100 levels of alien armada to get through. Your adventures will take from from the Earth to the Moon and finally to Titan via other stops in between. Power-ups are available through simple pick-up from bonus ships you shoot down which will give you temporary weapon upgrades or point collecting upgrades. The points you collect on each level can be used between levels to purchase upgrades to your weaponry and armour. Your shields will also need to be replenished between levels if you are shot, while other upgrades you purchase become permanent components. Enemy ships for the most part move in set patterns excepting the five mother-ships which move in a more aggressive pattern of their own choosing. Points are rewarded for efficiency in shooting enemies and for capturing enemy aliens who may parachute down off their crashing ship. Bonus rounds in between some levels allow the player to earn upgrades and points while an online high-score table allows the player to boast his/her scores online.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 26, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99459-titan-attacks\n"}
