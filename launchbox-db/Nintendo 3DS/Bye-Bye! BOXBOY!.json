{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bye-Bye! BOXBOY!", "overview": "Well, fear not\u2014Qbby is no ordinary box. Using his four startling new powers, you must solve hundreds of puzzles across 18 deadly worlds. Create boxes to climb, hover, warp, and bomb your way to salvation! Whether you're a newcomer or an old vet, thinking outside the box has never been more fun. Scattered across many challenging worlds, Black Smoke and other new hazards threaten to destroy Qbby. Survive vicious winds, viscous water, and more on your mission to rescue the mysteriously cute little wonders known as Qbabies. Each Qbaby you rescue will offer a new power: hit high buttons with a Boxrocket, destroy parts of the environment with a Bombox, teleport with a Warpbox, and even levitate a Remotebox. To the victor goes the goodies: earn new in-game costumes, comics, music, and challenge worlds by beating levels or tapping amiibo. Tap a Kirby\u2122 series amiibo\u2122 figure to receive a costume based on the tapped character!
