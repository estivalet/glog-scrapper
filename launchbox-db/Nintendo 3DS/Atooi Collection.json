{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atooi Collection", "overview": "Atooi Collection was Limited Run Games' 001 release on Nintendo 3DS, which went live August 7, 2020. Only 6000 copies were made. A single cartridge features the following critically-acclaimed games: Mutant Mudds Deluxe, Bomb Monkey, Xeodrifter, Mutant Mudds Super Challenge, and Chicken Wiggle. Ever since we first released Mutant Mudds in 2012, we have dreamed of releasing it physically on Nintendo 3DS. Due to the high cost and risky nature of the retail business, this dream seemed as though it would never come true. When Limited Run Games reached out to us with interest in publishing our games physically on Nintendo 3DS, we were floored. We are very grateful to Josh, Douglas, and the rest of the team for having faith in our games to release them physically on Nintendo 3DS. Atooi Collection represents our deep appreciation of retro pixel games, and we are thrilled to have them all featured in one amazing collection. The time we spent creating these five games were magical and fun for us. We hope you have as much fun playing them as we did making them!", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "August 7, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Atooi", "publishers": "Limited Run Games", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th4qOS6yjFE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152889-atooi-collection\n"}
