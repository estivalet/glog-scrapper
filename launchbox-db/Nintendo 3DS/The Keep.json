Explore subterranean depths in this first-person dungeon crawler featuring real-time combat, a unique rune magic system, exploration and puzzle solving. This game will awaken memories of what made old-school RPG dungeons so much fun to play while you fight, hunt for hidden treasures, and avoid deadly traps. Get to know your enemies, find their weaknesses, and crush them. Experiment with magic to discover powerful spells. Only the strongest will survive. To defeat the seemingly undefeatable Watrys, you will need to level-up your character and find powerful armour and weapons. Mastering both sword and magic is a fun and intuitive experience.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "September 18, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cinemax", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96452-the-keep\n"}
