The player character is Latis, a dhampir who enters a castle, which has mysteriously appeared in the human world, to defeat its vampire overlord. Bloody Vampire is a side-scrolling action-adventure game in which the player controls Latis as she finds her way through a vast, maze-like castle. She fights enemies in similar fashion to Hydlide or Ys, bumping into enemies with her body and either inflicting or taking damage depending on her strength and position. She will collect coins by defeating enemies that can then be used to buy equipment from shops. In order to progress deeper into the castle, she will need to acquire certain special items that grant her new abilities and allow her to traverse obstacles.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "January 31, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silver Star", "publishers": "Agetec", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Vampire", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgXjOOtpj8Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98674-bloody-vampire\n"}
