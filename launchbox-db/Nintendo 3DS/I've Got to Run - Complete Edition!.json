The game features six distinct modes: Endless Classic: The standard level with no added features. Endless Double: In this level, you have a double jump, represented on screen by a yellow wing. Endless Special: This level, set in outer space, starts slower, but can become blindingly fast if you pick up enough of the speed-up items! Endless Expert: The hardest mode, only for true experts, goes very fast and only gets harder from there! Endless Flip: Roy and his friends are back to the kitchen from Endless Classic..but something's a bit off. Endless Flight: Roy and friends have way more jumps than usual, but the sky isn't without its fair share of traps and obstacles!", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98969-ive-got-to-run-complete-edition\n"}
