{"altername_name": ["Shin Sekaiju no Meikyuu 2: Fafnir no Kishi"], "name": "Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight", "overview": "The next entry of the Etrian Odyssey Untold series is essentially two games in one - the first, a Nintendo 3DS update to Etrian Odyssey 2: Heroes of Laggard (released on Nintendo DS) with new dungeon layouts, new graphics, and system improvements from the recent Etrian Odyssey Untold. The second is the Untold portion - a brand new story mode with a fixed party, voiced dialogue, and animated cut scenes that follows the bittersweet tale of the Fafnir Knight and Princess Arianna. Like Persona Q, the Untold portion of the game has a strong focus on characters and their interactions as the story about the Fafnir Knight and Princess Arianna unfolds as they adventure forth into the ruins of Ginnungagap and the Yggdrasil Labyrinth with the hero Flavio and the two mysterious adventurers, Bertrand and Chloe.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "August 4, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etrian_Odyssey_2_Untold:_The_Fafnir_Knight", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpB8xGbd3A&ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29506-etrian-odyssey-2-untold-the-fafnir-knight\n"}
