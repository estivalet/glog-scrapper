{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai", "overview": "Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai is a spin-off of the Project Diva series of games. The characters in the game are all super-deformed and take on the appearance of Good Smile Company's Nendoroid collectible toys. The game's primary gameplay is the Chance Circle System. Buttons will appear around the border of a circle and a pointer will appear from the center of the circle extending all the way outside the border. It will then turn clockwise or counter-clockwise and when the pointer passes the button the player has to press the corresponding button. The music videos of the songs in-game are partly animations of the characters like in the previous games but some songs include the original music video with additional 3D effects.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "March 8, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku_and_Future_Stars:_Project_Mirai", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d60DKhiVano", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82000-hatsune-miku-and-future-stars-project-mirai\n"}
