{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cube Creator 3D", "overview": "Craft your own realm in stunning randomly generated worlds in Cube Creator 3D. You can also gather resources, combine elements, explore & combat strange creatures to survive in this expansive, cubic domain. Creative Mode allows you to explore worlds in true Stereoscopic 3D. The dual-screen presentation keeps your resource inventory free from cluttering the gameplay screen. Easy-to-use touchscreen controls make the open-world gameplay better than ever. Break-through dynamic lighting & effects positions Cube Creator 3D a cube above the rest. In Survival Mode, players can explore, craft, mine, & battle in forest, desert, mountain, & tundra-themed worlds. To start, you must use only your bare hands to gather resources to then craft tools & weapons, & to build protective shelters. Building better tools & weapons allows you to explore caves, mine their precious ores, & combat the many malicious monsters. Craft, explore and conquer these voxel worlds.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "August 20, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98907-cube-creator-3d\n"}
