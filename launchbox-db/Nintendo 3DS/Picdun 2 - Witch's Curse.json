{"altername_name": [], "name": "Picdun 2: Witch's Curse", "overview": "Picdun 2: Witch's Curse is a 3D dungeon RPG set in the mysterious dungeon called \"Picdun.\" Choose your partner from three female adventurers--the Archer, the Whipper and the Spellcaster--and venture into the depths of the dungeon together. Sixty stages await you, filled with a wide variety of puzzles ranging from easy to mind-bendingly difficult! Places you go are mapped automatically, and once you cover all the tiles on a floor you will complete the picture hidden underneath. As in the previous game, battles feature a large number of dynamic and powerful enemies. The hero is unable to attack due to the Witch's Curse, so he must protect his partner with a shield and guide her to attack by chopping down or slashing sideways. Also, you can trigger a power move by raising the shield at the same time as an enemy attack. Explore the depths of the dungeon to uncover the mystery of the Witch's Curse!", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 21, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Intense!
