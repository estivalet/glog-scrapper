{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slice It!", "overview": "Slice It! is a puzzle game where the player has to cut geometrical shapes into smaller pieces. This is done by drawing lines across the shapes. For each level the player can do a set number of slices and has to create a specific number of equally sized smaller pieces. If the pieces differ too much in size the level will be failed, however the pieces does not have to be in the same shape. When succeeding with a level the player gets a star rating between one to five. The closer the pieces are to each other the better rating will be earned. The game starts out with simple shapes like squares and triangles but as the player progresses through it the shapes get increasingly more complex. The game has a hint system to help players who get stuck. By using it the player is shown how the next line should be drawn. The number of hints is limited but new hints are earned when completing a level perfectly. Later in the game more features are added that makes for a bigger challenge. In the second chapter the levels have restricted areas that can't be cut through, while the third chapter adds mirrors that reflects lines.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 4, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99441-slice-it\n"}
