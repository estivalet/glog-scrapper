{"altername_name": [], "name": "Balloon Fight", "overview": "Controlling a character to pop your opponents' balloons before they pop yours sounds easy, doesn't it? Don\u2019t be fooled by this game's simple premise or cute exterior, though\u2013underneath these you\u2019ll find a surprisingly challenging game with strategy to spare. After mastering the easy-to-learn controls, you still have to get a grip on the game's impressively realistic physics. And if that's not enough, there are still the ever-increasing enemies and environmental hazards like lightning and water. Or try the game's second mode, Balloon Trip, if you feel like taking a break from the action and just want to see how long you can stay aloft. And, hey, who doesn\u2019t like popping balloons sometimes?", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "May 1, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98474-balloon-fight\n"}
