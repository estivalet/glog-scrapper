{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pok\u00e9 Transporter", "overview": "Pok\u00e9 Transporter is a sister application to Pok\u00e9mon Bank that can only be downloaded from Pok\u00e9mon Bank's main menu. It allows players to transfer Pok\u00e9mon from Pok\u00e9mon Black, White, Black 2 and White 2 to Pok\u00e9mon Bank, where they can then be transferred to Pok\u00e9mon X and Y. The program's function is limited, as it only transfers Pok\u00e9mon from Box 1 of the inserted DS game card, and it will transfer the entire box without letting the player choose which Pok\u00e9mon they want to transfer. This means only thirty Pok\u00e9mon can be transferred at once. Since Pok\u00e9mon Bank has a Box for transferred Pok\u00e9mon, it must be emptied before Pok\u00e9 Transporter is used again. Certain changes may also be made to transferred Pok\u00e9mon based on Ability, nicknames and native language.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "December 25, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Game Freak", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96864-poke-transporter\n"}
