{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pure Chess", "overview": "Pure Chess offers digital chess games on a 3D board with a camera view that can be moved freely. Players can choose from a selection of traditional chess sets including Staunton, Checker and Williams and play with a choice of locations comprising of a museum, a stylish penthouse and a grand library. For players at a beginner's level the game teaches the basics through step-by-step tutorials. Chess skills can then be improved through tournaments with four consecutive games against different opponents of different skills levels. It also contains the official Elo rating system. Against computer players match replay data can be saved, but games cannot be saved mid-game to resume at a later time. Next to exhibitions matches and tournaments, it offers \"play by mail\" for asynchronous multiplayer games with up to 8 games simultaneously that can span hours, days or weeks. There is no standard local or online mode, only the asynchronous \"play by mail\" where moves are sent to another player over PSN through a message. That multiplayer mode is also limited to friends, it cannot be played through unknown other players. In the Challenge mode specific board setups are offered with the challenge to reach checkmate in just a few moves.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99334-pure-chess\n"}
