Only the Blasting Agent can stop them, by infiltrating their secret base in an Antarctic volcano. Blasting Agent: Ultimate Edition is an upgraded version of Blasting Agent. It's a platform shooter taking place over six stages, each ending with a large boss. Throughout levels, sometimes hidden, are permanent upgrades for weapon range/power/spread and health capacity. Killed enemies will sometimes drop a heart that will regain one health point. Doors connect the different parts of the levels with each other, and also serve as checkpoints. All doors can be reentered to backtrack. Dying will respawn you at the latest checkpoint with full health. Collection all gold and killing all enemies (90% of each on easy mode) in a level will grant you upgrades ranging from double jumping, a recharging shield, extra sub-weapons, cosmetic costume changes and more. While useful, these upgrades are not necessary to proceed and do not provide access to any hidden items. Unlike weapon and health upgrades, these upgrades are shared between difficulty modes granting you an edge if you complete easy mode before hard.
