The modern mind has numerous devices to stay connected (e.g. laptops, smart phones, tablets), and these distractions have led to an information overload making it difficult to stay focused on specific tasks. Brain Age: Concentration Training offers newly designed training exercises to combat this information addiction. By spending at least five minutes a day, these exercises will challenge players with activities to help improve their concentration skills and the ability to access their short term memory. The new Devilish Training exercises dynamically increase or decrease in difficulty based on your real-time results to help consistently train players at the limit of their abilities. Beyond the Devilish Training, there are additional new and classic puzzles for every purpose, whether to challenge one's concentration or math skills or provide relaxation activities to give the brain a break.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 10, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14575-brain-age-concentration-training\n"}
