{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yo-Kai Watch 3: Sushi", "overview": "Nate and his family move to St. Peanutsburg, in a fictitious country called BBQ, after Nate's father transferred his business there. During his story arc of the main game, Nate, Whisper, and Jibanyan befriend Buck, who was able to see Yo-kai because of his stone that he wears on his necklace. Meanwhile, rumors of a UFO circulated around town, as the FBY agents, Blunder and Folly, were investigating the case. Also available for the first time in Yo-kai Watch 3, Hailey Anne makes her debut in the main series games. Unlike Nate though, her story takes place in Springdale, with Usapyon. In her story arc during the game, she forms the Hapyon Detective Agency, or whatever the player decides to call it. Her story arc involves most of her interactions with Usapyon, and the different cases that the detective agency receives. Later, Nate, Hailey Anne, Buck, and their befriended Yo-kai team up against a common threat, as the two soon knew what was of the UFO, from the series of events that lead them to this point.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104791-yo-kai-watch-3-sushi\n"}
