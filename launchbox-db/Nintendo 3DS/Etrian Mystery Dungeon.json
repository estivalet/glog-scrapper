{"altername_name": ["Sekaiju to Fushigi no Dungeon"], "name": "Etrian Mystery Dungeon", "overview": "Far off in the mountains, the small village Aslarga becomes a hub for adventurers looking for fame and fortune from the Mystery Dungeons. But dire challenges await even the most stalwart adventurers in Etrian Mystery Dungeon, a turn-based action RPG roguelike developed by ATLUS and Spike Chunsoft. The Nintendo 3DS exclusive mixes Etrian Odyssey\u2019s vast RPG party and skill customization aspects, and Mystery Dungeon\u2019s infinitely random dungeon adventures. The action/turn based combat means that battling monsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an elegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their parties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals using Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into the dungeons. Always randomized with various levels and paths, the dungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible loot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "April 7, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etrian_Mystery_Dungeon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bOSI9rDkE0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29001-etrian-mystery-dungeon\n"}
