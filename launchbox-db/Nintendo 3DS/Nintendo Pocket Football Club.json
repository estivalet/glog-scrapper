{"altername_name": ["Pocket Soccer League: Calciobit"], "name": "Nintendo Pocket Football Club", "overview": "Head up your own football team and shoot for the top! Nintendo Pocket Football Club puts you in the manager\u2019s seat at your very own football club, only on Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS. Can you keep the crowds chanting and guide your pint-sized players from the lower leagues to the wonders of the world stage? As manager, train up your players and choose your tactics wisely to make the most of their abilities. Once you\u2019re satisfied, send your team forth and watch your decisions play out in matches packed with action \u2013 but don\u2019t be afraid to alter your approach if it all starts to unravel before your eyes. Delve deep and show plenty of skill on the sidelines and you could lead them all the way to the glorious treble of the Pro League 1, the Federation Cup and the European Challenge Cup. With enough work, you could even bring the World Club Classic back home! Win, lose or draw, you\u2019ll earn Training Cards during each match. Between games, use Training Cards to improve your players\u2019 abilities: teach a defender how to tackle, help a midfielder perfect their passes or build a striker\u2019s morale before a crucial match with a relaxing spa treatment. Play your cards right by selecting the right training combination and you could come up with a special technique that scores your player an even bigger boost!", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "April 17, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22714-nintendo-pocket-football-club\n"}
