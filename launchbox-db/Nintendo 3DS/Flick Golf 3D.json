{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flick Golf 3D", "overview": "Flick Golf is a golf game for handheld devices. The game omits most of the rules of the traditional sport and instead offers a far more simplified take on it. The gameplay works similarly to other mobile sports games such as the Flick Kick series. The player views the action from a first-person perspective and hits the ball by doing swiping motions towards it on the touchscreen. The longer the swipe, the harder the hit gets. Once the ball is in the air the player can do curves and spins by swiping in the direction he wants it to go. The biggest difference from real golf is the scoring system. In Flick Golf the hole is surrounded by a target circle split in four zones. Hitting the zone closest to it gives the high points while the outer zone gives less. Missing the circle gives no points. Of course hitting the hole gives the most points. In addition to this the player can earn bonus points by doing extra skilled shots, for example with spins and curves. The game has three modes: quickshot, world tour and quickshot pro. In the quickshot mode the game is timed and the player has eighty seconds to get as large score as possible. Good shots lead to a time increase. In the world tour mode the player only has nine shots to reach the target score. Quickshot pro is just like the regular quickshot mode but harder with harsher weather conditions, less time and larger score targets.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98946-flick-golf-3d\n"}
