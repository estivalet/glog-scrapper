{"altername_name": [], "name": "Without Escape", "overview": "Without Escape harkens back to first-person graphic adventures of the early \u201890s, which relied on pre-rendered backgrounds and full-motion video to tell interactive stories. Explore the confines of your own home as you flip between a mundane existence and a horrifying otherworld. Can you escape the nightmare and find the answers you\u2019re looking for? One chilly winter night, you go home and notice that nobody\u2019s there. Your parents had told you that they would be visiting your grandparents for the weekend, so you give their absence no mind and go to bed. At 2:45 a.m., your sleep is suddenly interrupted by strange noises. A burglar, perhaps? You decide to investigate \u2013 only to plunge into a nightmarish web of stone, flesh, and flame. With no way to return to what you thought was reality, you must unravel the secret of your home\u2019s transformation. Are you prepared to endure the horrors that await you?", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "July 18, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Bumpy Trail Games", "publishers": "Bumpy Trail Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149747-without-escape\n"}
