{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dot Runner: Complete Edition", "overview": "\"Dot Runner: Complete Edition\" is a dot-eater action game in which dots that appear in dungeons must be devoured within the time limits. Featuring two complete storylines in one game across 100 stages, venture back to the year 986, and forward to 3015, enter the dungeons, and defeat your old enemies, the Yakkini-kus. This action-puzzle game is all about speeding through tight, maze-like levels, grabbing as many dots as you can along the way. These dots only appear once you run over certain tiles in the direction indicated by their arrow, giving you four seconds to scoop them up before they disappear forever.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "September 14, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "INTENSE", "publishers": "INTENSE", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98922-dot-runner-complete-edition\n"}
