{"altername_name": ["Hydroventure: Spin Cycle", "Hydroventure: Spin Cycle"], "name": "Fluidity: Spin Cycle", "overview": "Tilt, turn and even completely rotate your Nintendo 3DS to maneuver a puddle of water\u2014named Eddy\u2014through a maze-like magical world. Change from liquid to a block of ice or a steam cloud to solve fun, gravity-defying puzzles and defeat Goop monsters. Some puzzles require the player to rotate their Nintendo 3DS a full 360 degrees, turning the world upside-down, to navigate through tricky tunnels and crazy contraptions. Each state of water provides the player with different play abilities, all themed to match the properties of that state. This is helpful as the \u2018chapters\u2019 of the game contain hidden secrets that encourage exploration. Discovering all the well-hidden puzzle pieces unlocks bonus \u201cplayrooms\u201d that provide additional gameplay, and a scoring system (weighing speed vs. accomplishment) provides great re-playability. Due to the rotation of the hardware during gameplay, this game is not in 3D.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "December 27, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Curve Studios", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluidity:_Spin_Cycle", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_Qtg6E_rWg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77120-fluidity-spin-cycle\n"}
