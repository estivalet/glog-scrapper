{"altername_name": [], "name": "Music On: Electric Guitar", "overview": "Music On: Electric Guitar is a music game that may be more in-line with an iPod application than the typical downloadable game from Nintendo's virtual stores. Electric Guitar is the latest in Abylight's Music On series. The game promises the ability to play electric guitar on the Nintendo DSi by strumming on the touch-screen with the stylus as if it was a guitar pick. The title featues thirty-two definable chords which may be assigned using the buttons and d-pad of the DSi system. Like playing with a real guitar, Music On: Electric Guitar also features the use of Delay, Distortion, and Flanger pedals, wich may be operated on the touch-screen. Playing with the arrangement of the pedals will provide a variety of different sounds. Electric Guitar introduces an Advanced Play mode which allows players to play chord variations, arpeggios, and melodies. More than 950 chords are available in the game and players can save up to ten play sessions. Music On: Electric Guitar is for one player.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99330-music-on-electric-guitar\n"}
