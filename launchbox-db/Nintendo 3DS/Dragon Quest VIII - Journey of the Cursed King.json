Set off on an unforgettable adventure with Yangus, the bandit with a heart of gold, Jessica, the high-born magical minx, and Angelo, knight and lothario, by your side! Players are able to capture monsters that inhabit the battlefield in this role-playing adventure. These beasts differ from the creatures you'd normally encounter in battles, as they have special names and abilities unique to them. Once a monster has been scouted, it's added to a growing arsenal of creatures that can then be assembled into teams of three for use as support characters in battle.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "January 20, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_VIII", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kcG9I9oElc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73234-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king\n"}
