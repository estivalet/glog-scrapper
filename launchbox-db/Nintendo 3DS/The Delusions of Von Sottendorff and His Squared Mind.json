{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Delusions of Von Sottendorff and His Squared Mind", "overview": "The objective of this room-swapping puzzle platforming game is to free Baron Von Sottendorff from his own madness; to do this, you must overcome the challenges that appear along the way. As you solve the different levels in the game by connecting rooms in the Barn's ''mansion of his mind' together, you receive objects that will help you unlock memories from his life. The game itself consists of 40 sliding puzzles, each encompassing a set of sliding rooms to move around and connect. The more memories you get by completing these rooms, the closer you are to regaining his sanity.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98361-the-delusions-of-von-sottendorff-and-his-squared-mind\n"}
