{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heroes of Ruin", "overview": "HEROES OF RUIN uses StreetPass to create an inventive in-game 'Traders' Network' where players can buy and sell rare and powerful items picked up in battle. With an ever-changing inventory updated from each player passed in public, character strengths and abilities can be greatly enhanced by accessing items from other players' games. Outside of the game, HEROES OF RUIN makes use of SpotPass to reward players with rare items or unique challenges through local Wi-Fi hotspots. The official HEROES OF RUIN community website will reward players further with daily challenges and quests available to complete in-game. With social media functionality, the site will also give players a platform to meet other gamers, swap ideas and items, and team up in-game.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "July 17, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "N-Space", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Ruin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj6od0pMwRI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12282-heroes-of-ruin\n"}
