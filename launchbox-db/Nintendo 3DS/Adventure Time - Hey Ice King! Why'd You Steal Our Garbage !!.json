{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!!", "overview": "Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd you steal our garbage?! is the first video game based on the radical, Emmy nominated Cartoon Network show about two close friends - Jake, a wise old dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything else to become a great hero. Players will explore the Land of Ooo and set out on heroic quests, as their favorite characters Finn and Jake, in a unique action adventure experience. Adventure Time show creator Pendleton Ward is also heavily involved with the game creation, including the design of a brand new storyline, concept, and quests. Finn and Jake wake up one morning to find their trash stolen by the Ice King! Jake couldn't care less about half-eaten bananas, crumpled up math notes, and old chicken diapers - but when the Ice King uses these stolen goods to construct a Garbage Princess, our heroes embark on a fantastical adventure and teach him a lesson! Journey through the Land of Ooo in an offbeat adventure and discover perilous dungeons, unimaginable treasures, the true meaning of friendship, and never-ending fun!", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "November 20, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "WayForward Technologies", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time:_Hey_Ice_King!_Why%27d_You_Steal_Our_Garbage%3F!!", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDyIwTDjENc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12552-adventure-time-hey-ice-king-whyd-you-steal-our-garbage\n"}
