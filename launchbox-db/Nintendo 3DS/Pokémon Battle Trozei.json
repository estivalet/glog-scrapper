In Pok\u00e9mon Battle Trozei, you must make matches of the same Pok\u00e9mon from among all the many Pok\u00e9mon that fill your Trozei Box - the large field of Pok\u00e9mon on the lower screen. The Pok\u00e9mon that appears on the top screen is the wild Pok\u00e9mon that you are facing in battle. Line up three Pok\u00e9mon in a row to clear your Pok\u00e9mon from the box, and to attack and reduce the HP of the wild Pok\u00e9mon that you face. When its HP reaches zero, you will be able to Trozei that Pok\u00e9mon! As time passes, the wild Pok\u00e9mon will also lash out to attack you in return. When you\u2019re attacked by a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the Trozei Box will lose some of its energy. The wild Pok\u00e9mon you face may even try to get in your way! If the Trozei Box\u2019s energy reaches zero, it\u2019s game over.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "March 12, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Genius Sonority", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Battle_Trozei", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HifNwwr8NoQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73896-pokemon-battle-trozei\n"}
