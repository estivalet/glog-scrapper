{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dillon's Rolling Western", "overview": "On the dusty plains of the new frontier, fearsome rock monsters are attacking the villages and stealing their livestock. It's up to Dillon, an armadillo out for justice, to set the world to rights. If he can defend a village from the rocky threat for three days, then his work is done and he can hit the road for the next town. Dillon's Rolling Western is a tower defence game divided into two segments. During the day, the player-controlled Dillon can explore the local area to look for resources to sell and use the money to build up the village's defences, as well as run errands for the villagers. During the night, the rock monsters arrive to attack the village, so to support the defences he's built up, Dillon will fight them by rolling into a ball and charging at them. The player can roll Dillon into a ball using the touch screen and control his direction while rolling using the circle pad. Upon impact, they can either hold for a grinding attack or tap to start a combo. Once Dillon has successfully held the rock monsters back for three days, he is free to move on to another village.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 22, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Vanpool", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNUer6t0bl4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20204-dillons-rolling-western\n"}
