{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nicktoons MLB 3D", "overview": "Nickelodeon Nicktoons MLB 3D is balanced on the juxtaposition of animation-inspired silliness and serious sports play. From popular and cult-favorite cartoons, both past and present, Nickelodeon characters in the dugout include SpongeBob, Invader Zim, Fanboy, Chum Chum, Ren, and Stimpy. High profile players from all 30 Major League Baseball teams are also featured. Nickelodeon characters appear as they do in their cartoons. The game's 175 real-life MLB pros are rendered with equal authenticity, and each wears his team uniform. Similarly, the toon-inspired stadiums in the game impose humorous ground rules, and are festooned with inside jokes for fans, while the stylized re-creations of real-world MLB stadiums may be recognizable by ballpark regulars. New modes in the 3DS version of the game include an all-star \"Showdown\" and the augmented-reality \"Freeze Toss.\"", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "March 6, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Black Lantern Studios", "publishers": "2K Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95140-nicktoons-mlb-3d\n"}
