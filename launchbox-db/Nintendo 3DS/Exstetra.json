Characters are able to transfer energy between one another via kissing. EXS energy is obtained by defeating monsters, and is used towards special techniques. Players are also able to upgrade their weapons and armor by 'enchanting' them, and abilities become stronger depending on how many times the gear has been enchanted. Enchantment stones are able to be purchased, but can also be obtained from defeated enemies.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "November 7, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio Saizensen", "publishers": "Furyu", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exstetra", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103662-exstetra\n"}
