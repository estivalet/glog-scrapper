{"altername_name": ["New Super Mario Bros. 2: Gold Edition", "New Super Mario Bros. 2: Special Edition"], "name": "New Super Mario Bros. 2", "overview": "Mario Hits the Mushroom Kingdom Jackpot! Bowser has once again kidnapped Princess Peach, but this time, Mario has another objective. The Mushroom Kingdom is bursting with more gold coins than before. Each level is littered with gold as coins rain down from overhead pipes, trails of coins are left behind special gold enemies and gold pipes transport Mario into coin-filled caverns. It's up to players to collect as many coins as possible throughout their adventure. \u2022 The game records all the coins players collect throughout the game, so completing a level is only part of the fun. Every level is filled with golden opportunities, such as gold rings that turn enemies into valuable gold versions and a Gold Flower that gives Mario the ability to turn almost anything in his path into coins. \u2022 Coin Rush Mode allows players to collect as many coins as possible across three levels and challenge friends to beat their record via StreetPass. \u2022 The return of Raccoon Mario gives Mario the ability to fly and access hidden areas.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "July 28, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Super_Mario_Bros._2", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHdu3slBIY8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12060-new-super-mario-bros-2\n"}
