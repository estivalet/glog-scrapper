{"altername_name": ["Rolling Western, The: Saigo no Youjinbou"], "name": "Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger", "overview": "Dillon, an armadillo, is a ranger charged with protecting villages from nightly invasions of walking rock monsters called Grocks. The Grocks attack the villages to feed on Scrogs, the residents' livestock. While Dillon is able to attack Grocks by rolling into them, the Grocks can sometimes outnumber Dillon. Thus, the villages have established defense towers that can be outfitted with weapons that will attack Grocks whenever they are in range. To get guns, Dillon must buy them, and sometimes he may have to build the gun tower first. In order to improve the villages' defenses, Dillon must collect materials by exploring mines and defeating Grocks; the materials can then be used to build stronger doors for the village. The stronger a door is, the harder it is for a Grock to get in.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "April 11, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Vanpool", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillon%27s_Rolling_Western", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20454-dillons-rolling-western-the-last-ranger\n"}
