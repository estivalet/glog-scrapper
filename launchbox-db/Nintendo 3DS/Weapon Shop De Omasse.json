{"altername_name": [], "name": "Weapon Shop De Omasse", "overview": "In Weapon Shop de Omasse the player takes on the role of Yuhan, a young apprentice at a shop that specializes at renting out weapons to the various NPCs that populate the game. The player's main role is to match the appropriate weapon to the appropriate customer. When the player has decided which weapon to make, the main gameplay begins in the form of a rhythm-based mini-game where you tap the touchscreen to the timing of the music to get the weapon as strong as possible. Each weapon created by the player also features a Grindcast, which continuously sends the player information about the weapon's journeys. Everything it sees, kills and hears is presented as feedback, including some embarrassing moments for the people who rented it.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 20, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Level-5", "publishers": "Level-5", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20595-weapon-shop-de-omasse\n"}
