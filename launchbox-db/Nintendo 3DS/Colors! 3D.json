{"altername_name": [], "name": "Colors! 3D", "overview": "Colors! 3D is a painting simulation program with simple, accessible tools: Select brush style, point size, and opacity. Choose from hundreds of thousands of colors with the palette tool, or grab-and-go with the eyedropper and switch between layers. 3D canvas: Create multi-layered paintings and immerse yourself in their depth with the 3D screen. Playback: After the user's created a work of art, use the playback feature to observe how it was made. The playback feature also enables the player to stop a painting from anywhere in process and create a new branch from there. Collaborative painting: Players can invite a friend to help them with painting in real-time using Wi-Fi. Paintovers & Overlays: Snap a photo with the 3DS camera and use it to help in creating compositions. User-generated content: A new way of painting requires new ways of thinking \u2013 so sharing and comparing is key. Upload paintings to share with the Colors! community, browse the gallery, and use the playback feature to learn other painters' techniques. The Weekly Challenge offers continual opportunities to celebrate our users' contributions.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "April 5, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Collecting Smiles", "publishers": "Arc System Works", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20577-colors-3d\n"}
