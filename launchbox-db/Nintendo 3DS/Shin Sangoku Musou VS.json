{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shin Sangoku Musou VS", "overview": "Shin Sangoku Musou VS (\u771f\u30fb\u4e09\u570b\u7121\u53cc VS, Shin Sangoku Musou Versus) is the second portable Dynasty Warriors spin-off title produced by Kenichi Ogasawara \u2013 the other being Dynasty Warriors Next. It uses Dynasty Warriors 7 characters and visuals as its base. Ogasawara claims this title is being made as a direct contrast to Samurai Warriors Chronicles \u2013\u2013 which he thinks sticks closely to the basic Warriors formula \u2013\u2013 by striving to present a unique portable experience. He wants to keep the heart of Nintendo's competitive games (e.g. Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.) while simultaneously presenting a warlike, action intensive experience. He thinks the cutthroat nature of the game is a spiritual callback to the series' roots. Consumers who purchased the game early can earn several different costumes for their edit characters depending on the date and method of purchase. A trial version of the versus mode in this game has been available in Japan since April 4. Cao Pi, Sun Shangxiang, Zhao Yun, and Wang Yuanji are selectable.
