{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fortified Zone", "overview": "A male and a female commando named Masato Kanzaki & Mizuki Makimura have been sent to the jungle on a mission. That mission, should they choose to accept it, is to destroy an enemy base and everyone in it. Stealth is required, since brute force will only lead to their capture. On their four-stage mission, Masato and Mizuki will encounter a host of mercenaries, soldiers, robots, and other enemies bent on cutting down the two commandos in their tracks and stopping them from destroying the heart of the Fortified Zone. It's up to the player to find out if their mission succeeds or fails. You are able to switch between the two characters at any time. Both characters have advantages and weaknesses - Masato can use special weapons while Mizuki can jump over obstacles.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98951-fortified-zone\n"}
