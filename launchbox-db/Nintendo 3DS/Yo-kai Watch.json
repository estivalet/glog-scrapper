{"altername_name": ["Youkai Watch"], "name": "Yo-kai Watch", "overview": "The YO-KAI WATCH game is about hundreds of sometimes cute, sometimes spooky, and usually mischievous Yo-kai that inhabit our world. Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply, Yo-kai. They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere. Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an everyday object discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly humanlike. As you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend them, and turn them into a team to battle other Yo-kai. Befriending new Yo-kai may not be so easy, though \u2013 in many cases, you will need to battle with them and impress them during your battle. Each Yo-kai has its own unique skills and strengths and you\u2019ll use them to challenge the evil Yo-kai and help people in need of solving daily problems \u2013 like an argument with a friend or forgetting something important \u2013 which may be caused by mischievous Yo-kai hidden everywhere.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "November 6, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Level-5", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-kai_Watch_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT5YWlGikdE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32501-yo-kai-watch\n"}
