{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kakuro by Nikoli", "overview": "With the Nikoli puzzle series, you can enjoy high-quality \"Kakuro\" puzzles, created by Nikoli, who gave the world-famous puzzle its name. The Nintendo 3DS allows for the realization of simple and easy to play operability. \"Kakuro by Nikoli\" contains 50 Kakuro puzzles. In \"Kakuro\", you break down the totaled numbers given as hints to fill in the spaces. Well. We say \"break down the numbers\", but in Nikoli's Kakuro very little calculations are actually required, with concentration and the power of deduction being the most necessary attributes. To ensure your long-term enjoyment, we're prepared both a \"Stage Clear\" mode and a \"Random\" mode. In \"Stage Clear\" mode, you progress by clearing puzzles one by one, and in \"Random\" mode puzzles are generated at random. Please enjoy this high-quality \"Kakuro\" game.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "May 31, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "nikoli", "publishers": "Hamster", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165880-kakuro-by-nikoli\n"}
