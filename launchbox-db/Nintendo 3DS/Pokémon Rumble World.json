When you defeat one of the wild Pok\u00e9mon you meet in a stage, it sometimes becomes your friend. Even Mega-Evolving Pok\u00e9mon will join the battles, a first for a game in the Pok\u00e9mon Rumble series! Befriend as many Pok\u00e9mon as you can: as you collect more species of Pok\u00e9mon, your Adventurer Rank goes up. As your Adventurer Rank goes up, the shop will offer more products, and stages will feature stronger Pok\u00e9mon. It's not just Pok\u00e9mon that will appear in Pok\u00e9mon Rumble World. Your Mii character will also appear in your game, as well as the Mii characters of players you pass! It's the first time in the Pok\u00e9mon Rumble series that Mii characters have joined in to interact with Pok\u00e9mon and have adventures together. Your story is set in the kingdom of toys, and the adventure starts when the king summons you. He explains his frustration at having only one Pikachu. In contrast, a mysterious magician has captured several Pok\u00e9mon! So the king asks you to show that magician a thing or two by collecting lots more Pok\u00e9mon, and he lends you his Pikachu to get you started on your adventures. Depart from the castle town via a hot-air balloon to get to different areas where wild Toy Pok\u00e9mon await! It's fun to connect with other friends playing Pok\u00e9mon Rumble World. Players can visit your castle town via StreetPass. Connect your Nintendo 3DS system to the Internet, and Mii characters of faraway players will visit you. They can even provide support for you in future battles in a variety of ways. Poke Diamonds are meant to make your adventures even more exciting and easy. With Poke Diamonds, you can get hot-air balloons, clothes for your Mii character, extras that provide more fun in your game play, and more. In addition, Poke Diamonds can be used to continue playing in a stage after your Pok\u00e9mon's HP runs out, as well as to re-inflate hot-air balloons that have become deflated after use. You can acquire them in various ways, including at the beginning of the adventure and when you speak to Mii characters who come to the castle town via StreetPass. You can also purchase Poke Diamonds at the shop in the castle town via Nintendo eShop.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "April 8, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Ambrella", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Rumble_World", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/IIg7COqNE5o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69660-pokemon-rumble-world\n"}
