It is the fourth entry of the Magician's Quest series. Like the previous work \"Stylish Wizard\", there is no chronological connection. \"Magic Town\" is the first game to be released on the Nintendo 3DS. It follows the systems and elements of previous titles, setting in a magical world and communicating with the residents who appear in the game. This time in the town a huge shopping mall was built. Players can enjoy magic, fashion, and the development of their own shop. A system has been added that allowed real shops to appear in the game by downloading real shops. As of September 2020, downloading items and shops has been discontinued.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "December 20, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145607-tongari-boushi-to-mahou-no-machi\n"}
