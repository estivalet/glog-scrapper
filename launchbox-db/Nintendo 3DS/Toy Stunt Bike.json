{"altername_name": [], "name": "Toy Stunt Bike", "overview": "Toy Stunt Bike is a motorbike trial game. Like the name suggests players use toy bikes instead of real ones and the tracks are also set in environments of a typical house and it\u00b4s surroundings with the garden, a bathroom and a bedroom as example locations (there are 60 racetracks in all) giving the game a similar atmosphere to the Micro Machines series. The game is presented in 3D and uses a third person perspective from the side. The game features online leaderboards allowing the player to compare his results to those of other players.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "June 26, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99461-toy-stunt-bike\n"}
