{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skylanders Giants", "overview": "Skylanders Giants is an all-new adventure for existing Skylanders toys that will also add 20 new characters--including eight giant ones--to the roster. The 3DS version of Skylanders Giants puts the skylanders against the evil pirate Captain Frightbeard, who was once banished together with his crew to the Chest of Exile by the Arkeyans. The levels are accessed from Flynn's ship, and only two skylanders can be sent at a time. The player must then complete each mission's objectives with the chosen characters, and can only leave once he has succeeded, both characters are defeated, or by bailing out, which cancels any progress made to the level. The skylanders can however be revived from within the mission for a fee, and are automatically revived once on Flynn's ship. Contrary to the console version, the figures abilities are unlocked by leveling-up rather than being bought from an NPC, and are therefore not transferable from one version to the other. The 3DS skylanders also all have the ability to jump, which is used for completing the levels, as the platforming gets more complex as the game progresses. The starter pack comes with three skylanders figure: Cynder Punch Pop Fizz Tree Rex Only Tree Rex is included in the Portal Owners Pack.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "October 21, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "N-Space", "publishers": "Activision Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11654-skylanders-giants\n"}
