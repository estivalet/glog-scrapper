SpongeBob SquigglePants puts you in the driver's seat for a dizzying series of lightening-speed Nanogames, giving you mere seconds to finish one before moving right on to the next. Within this rapid-fire succession of challenges, SpongeBob SquigglePants exposes players to never-before-seen SpongeBob art styles from the Nickelodeon vault. SpongeBob SquigglePants also lets players digitally draw, paint, color and choose from dozens of SpongeBob-themed stamps to create a masterpiece worthy of a place in Patchy's own collection of SpongeBob art. The entire game is hosted by SpongeBob's biggest fan, Patchy the Pirate, in a never-before-seen live action experience for an added level of under-the-sea silliness.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "May 17, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "WayForward Technologies", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17791-spongebob-squigglepants-3d\n"}
