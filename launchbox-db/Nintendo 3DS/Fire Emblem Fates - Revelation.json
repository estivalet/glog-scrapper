{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation", "overview": "Two kingdoms have met at the crossroads of war, and you've walked the path of loyalty or kinship. Yet some mysteries remain. After purchasing Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright or Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest, take a leap of faith in this third path, siding with neither royal family. The answers you seek lie in another realm. Dare to discover the truth. In this revelatory Fire Emblem experience, your customized avatar is the main hero. An army of knights, mages, archers and more are at your command for the most challenging battles in series history. Each unit and weapon has strengths and weaknesses that you must balance against the foes they face. Partner your allies on the battlefield so they can support one another in combat. Building relationships is key - the closer your allies become, the better they'll fight together.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "March 9, 2016", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Fates", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUN94OByvw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103423-fire-emblem-fates-revelation\n"}
