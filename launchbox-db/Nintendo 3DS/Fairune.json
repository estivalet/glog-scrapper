{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fairune", "overview": "In Fairune, the protagonist is a girl. She has to find the three Ancient Statues, and use these to seal away a malicious power. This is a top-down viewed RPG, with the girl's life bar growing as she levels up. Gameplay consists of looking for dungeons while in the overworld, puzzle solving to advance into dungeons, and combat; the latter is automatical, in a manner common to dungeon crawlers: once an enemy is encountered, the level of it and the level of the protagonist determine the result. Mobile versions use an on-screen gamepad instead of touch controls. The Nintendo 3DS version has exclusive maps and puzzles.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98936-fairune\n"}
