You\u2019ll need lightning-fast reflexes and an eye for strategy to succeed in this fast-paced puzzle game, where live-action video blends seamlessly with wacky digital graphics. Throw and roll hapless bystanders into lines of people, trying to group three or more who wear the same color together so that they\u2019ll form a clique and disappear. Form cliques and eliminate the lines you\u2019re facing as fast as you can to progress through the game\u2019s many stages. With two different play modes - Story Mode and Challenge Mode - this game\u2019s got you covered whether you\u2019re looking for quick gaming sessions or longer endurance challenges.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "August 8, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Mitchell", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Crash_Mobs", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6fK3cA4iSc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20596-tokyo-crash-mobs\n"}
