It follows series protagonist Samus Aran, who is sent by the Galactic Federation to exterminate the parasitic Metroids on their home planet of SR388. The game features a story and structure similar to Metroid II but with new controls, visuals, and gameplay. It also introduces some features that are new to the 2D Metroid games, such as melee counterattacks, an ability to fire freely at any angle, and a selection of different abilities. The development on Samus Returns began in 2015, with longtime Metroid developer Yoshio Sakamoto producing it. The game was met with positive reception from video game journalists, who praised its visuals and improved gameplay over the original game, with many viewing it as a return to form for the series.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "September 15, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "MercurySteam", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.28", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Samus_Returns", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhOx-FpEAQk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86600-metroid-samus-returns\n"}
