Uncover the intertwining stories of Alm and Celica, engage foes, fend off dragons, and explore 3D dungeons. Your prowess will grow as you master this melding of modern and legacy Fire Emblem gameplay. Alm and Celica lead separate armies united by a common goal: to stop the war and unify Valentia. Each army has its own path, units, and supplies, so balance their needs. Here, battle is waged in the traditions of elder Fire Emblem games, when the rules of battle were simpler, yet the challenge formidable as ever. When you encounter a dungeon, explore it in action-adventure style: smash false walls, break pots, or ambush enemies with a slash of your sword. You never know; you may stumble upon some uncommon items\u2026or a hidden tactical battle with a brutal boss.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "May 19, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.91", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Echoes:_Shadows_of_Valentia", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6KSzCsrxVI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77947-fire-emblem-echoes-shadows-of-valentia\n"}
