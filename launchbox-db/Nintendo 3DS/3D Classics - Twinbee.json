{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Classics: Twinbee", "overview": "This vertical-scrolling arcade game was originally available only on the Famicom system in Japan. Now, for the first time ever in North America, fans can play this classic shooter with a new 3D look. Guide the TwinBee spacecraft as you dodge and destroy waves of aerial and ground enemies. If you get hit and lose both of your ship\u2019s arms, find an ambulance for repairs quickly. Shoot through the clouds to uncover bells. Collect the bells for extra points, or continue to shoot at them to gain different upgrades for your ship. Additional power-ups can also be collected from the ground. Fly high in the sky with your anthropomorphic spacecraft in this new version of a classic.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "September 22, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Arika", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TwinBee", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd6MZ8Fs-9E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76811-3d-classics-twinbee\n"}
