A set of power-up items will grant you special abilities, like turning your little rider into a funky frog or letting you freely fly around the stage, while each course is full of dangerous gimmicks such as lasers, spiked blocks or giant whirlwinds. Furthermore, the GRAND PRIX mode lets you challenge players all over the world in an endless random parcour featuring all gimmicks in the whole game. And if that's not enough, a free to download SPECIAL STAGE will shoot you to the moon!", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgKHXeNfhw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98357-bike-rider-dx2-galaxy\n"}
