{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tappingo", "overview": "Solve pixel puzzles by tapping numbered blocks to extend them into lines. At the start of each puzzle most of the blocks on the screen are empty, while some are filled. Some of the filled blocks contain numbers, which indicate to the player the length of the line that must extend from them. The player must select a numbered block and a cardinal direction in which to extend a line. Each line will extend until it hits a filled block (such as another numbered block or line), exceeding the intended length, so the player must carefully extend lines in the correct order. Once all blocks have been extended, the colours and shapes of the lines reveal a pixel image. While recognising the image as it is revealed can help guide the player, only logic is necessary to solve the puzzle.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 27, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Goodbye Galaxy Games", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20594-tappingo\n"}
