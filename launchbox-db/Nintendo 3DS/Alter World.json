{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alter World", "overview": "Alter World is a puzzle-platformer with a painting art style. The game has about 80 short levels, each consisting of a single screen and its darker, alternate version. In each level, the goal is the same: just get to the exit door. You can switch between the main screen and its \"alter\" at a press of a button (often while you are mid-air, often multiple times while mid-air). While there are almost no enemies, most levels have spikes which kill you at a single touch, forcing you to restart the level. Other puzzle elements include moving platforms, bouncing pads, teleportation portals and gravity-changing switches.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "April 5, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Lemondo Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165766-alter-world\n"}
