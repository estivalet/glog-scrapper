{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kami", "overview": "KAMI is a puzzle game where levels are won when the entire area is made in a single colour or pattern in a set amount of turns. A playfield consists of a number of tiles in different colours or patterns. At the bottom of the screen the available patterns and colours are shown. By selecting a colour or a pattern at the bottom of the screen and then selecting one in the playfield, the colour is changed for that tile and every adjacent one horizontally or vertically as long as there no different one in the way. The limited amount of turns per puzzle requires a careful approach and some trial and error. A puzzle is marked as 'perfect' when the required amount of turns is met. 'Good' is achieved for one turn too many and 'failed' for more turns. Puzzles are unlocked gradually by clearing them. There are five sets of nine basic puzzles and three set of nine premium puzzles that are more difficult and were added in later update. The amount of colours or patterns per puzzle ranges from three to five. The premium sets have puzzles based on patterns instead of colours. A limited amount of hints are available per day.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "February 5, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Circle Entertainment", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100384-kami\n"}
