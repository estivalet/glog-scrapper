Work out your path carefully as you push rocks out of the way or you could find Dan caught in one of the many traps. As you dig deeper and deeper through the 100 caves, you will uncover secret gems buried in the earth, unravel the mysteries of the wormholes which transport you around the level, blow holes in walls with the abandoned barrels full of TNT and collect pickaxes to release gems that are trapped in rock. Challenge yourself to complete the cave, beat the timer and collect the hidden secret gem on every level.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149888-digger-dan-dx\n"}
