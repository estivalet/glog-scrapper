{"altername_name": [], "name": "MindFeud", "overview": "MindFeud is a two-player board game that resembles Scrabble, but is played with symbols instead of letters. Each player receives six symbol tiles, which must be placed on the board according to the rules to score points. Each tile has a color and a symbol. There are six different symbols and six different colors, making it 36 unique tiles in total. These must be placed on the board so that adjacent tiles (horizontal and vertical) are either the same color or the same symbol, but not both. The player can lay down as many of their tiles as possible as long as it forms a valid combination. All tiles much be placed in a connected row or column, and all adjacent tiles much be valid according to the rules. A player may choose to swap any number of tiles from the hand or pass instead of placing tiles on any round. Points are scored by the number of tiles in newly formed rows and columns. The points are doubled if all six symbols or colors are aligned. The board also contains 2x and 3x multipliers. Bonuses can be combined. Each game can be played with 36, 72 or 144 total tiles, affecting the length of the game. The board can either use a default position of bonus multipliers or they can be randomized. For solo play, the player can challenge ADAMA, an AI with three different difficulty settings. Multiplayer games can only be played online, with either a friend or a random matchup.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99313-mindfeud\n"}
