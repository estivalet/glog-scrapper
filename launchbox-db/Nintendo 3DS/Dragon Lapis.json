A thousand years ago, a great battle ensued between two dragons, one gold and the other silver, where they were sealed away. However, the real tale begins many centuries later after the Silver Dragon reawakens, and launches an assault on a frontier village in the far north. There, a royal knight by the name of Lucas serves as a guard after being relegated to the rural and much isolated location by the King.
