{"altername_name": [], "name": "Virus Shooter XX", "overview": "An invasion from outer space is in progress, but the threat doesn't come from marauding UFOs or wayward meteorites about to make deep impact. No, the invasion is being carried out by starbust-shaped colored viruses who have permeated the entirety of the planet. Some viruses have shells like a turtle and others are winged like a bat, while others look like mice with rodent ears. To combat the threat, players shoot the viruses. That's it. You shoot the viruses which float in the air with touch-tapping action to eradicate them. Game modes include Story Mode which contains 50 stages of virus shooting fun, Mission Mode, Training Mode, Forecast, and Guide.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "March 31, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Dorasu", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164988-virus-shooter-xx\n"}
