{"altername_name": [], "name": "Secret Agent Files: Miami", "overview": "Mia is direct, gruff and has a big mouth. She's a good shooter, but she's also klutzy and can be pretty sensitive at times. And she always has a solution. Just not right now. The Secret Service just fired her. She has no money, no papers and no idea how she got into this situation. But she'll be damned if she doesn't find out what this crap is all about - to put it in her words. Stranded in Miami, she now goes to see her mother, whom she hasn't seen in years. And her mother has no inkling of Mia's real job\u2026 You will meet a wide variety of people over the course of this gripping tale. Some will be on your side, others not so much. Proceed with caution and be sure to look and listen closely. It's the only way Mia can survive and maybe even find out who or what is behind it all.", "platform": "Nintendo 3DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95184-secret-agent-files-miami\n"}
