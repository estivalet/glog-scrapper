{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tycoon Tex", "overview": "Players take on the role of Tycoon Tex, an oil tycoon and with the task is to protect the pipeline by patrolling it and fixing any gaps and shooting bombs that are dropped by jet fighters over various levels. The game is a side view horizontal scroller and the player must run along the pipeline at a controlled speed by going faster or slower. To complete the level, the player must fill a % complete gauge before the oil pressure gauge reaches zero by jumping over any gaps in the pipeline to fix them. The faster the player runs, the quicker the pressure gauge decreases. Bombs dropped from the jets make gaps, however they can be shot; if the player misses, the gap may be jumped to fix it. If the player hits a gap or a bomb, the player will lose a life. Before the game starts, the player may select how many lives to have (1-6). There are also three difficulty levels to choose from: easy, hard, and impossible.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Micro Projects", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136721-tycoon-tex\n"}
