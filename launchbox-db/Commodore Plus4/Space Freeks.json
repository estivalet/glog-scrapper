In this side view single screen shooter, you must protect yourself, crew and craft by blasting Space Freeks who are determined to destroy you over various levels. You move your craft, left or right, at the bottom of the screen and blast waves of Freeks as they move around the screen above you. The Freeks will drop bombs and these have to be avoided as well as any Freeks that move to the bottom of the screen, and if you are hit then you lose one of five lives, but you do move to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Solar Software", "publishers": "Solar Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372954-space-freeks\n"}
