{"altername_name": [], "name": "2048", "overview": "2048 is a puzzle game where the idea is to make the number 2048 appear on a 4 x 4 grid. Starting with two number two's, you must move the numbers to make other number two's appear and when they touch then they double to make four. Moving the numbers make other numbers appear and if the same number touches then they double as well. You have to keep doubling the numbers until you make 2048 without filling the grid and you are unable to move any more numbers.
