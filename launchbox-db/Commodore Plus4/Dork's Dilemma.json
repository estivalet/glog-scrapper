{"altername_name": ["Rooms of Peril"], "name": "Dork's Dilemma", "overview": "You are Dork and you have crashed your spaceship and knocked yourself out on an unknown planet. Waking up, you realise that the planets occupants, Zobwats have stripped your spaceship clean and hidden the parts in an underground kingdom. Each piece is placed in the middle of various single screens with exits on the walls and you must kill a certain amount of Zobwats to get each piece. To kill the Zobwats you must drop a Time Bomb and it will explode after a couple of seconds so you need to make sure you are not in its blast range. After the bomb explodes it takes a few seconds for you to be able to use another one. If you are hit by the blast range or hit a Zobwat then you lose one of three lives. Once all Zobwats are destroyed then the piece appears on the right of the screen in a jigsaw grid and you move to an exit to find another piece of your ship using a map on the right side of the screen. At any time you can go to the jigsaw grid to rearrange the pieces in their correct place.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Projects", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOPIJgKXGbo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117809-dorks-dilemma\n"}
