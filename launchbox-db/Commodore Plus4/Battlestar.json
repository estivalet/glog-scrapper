{"altername_name": ["Battle Star"], "name": "Battlestar", "overview": "While on routine patrol over the planet Nuljai you spot the huge construction of a ring around the planet by the evil Cyfrots to syphon the water and transport it to their home planet. You decide that you will fly over the length of the ring and destroy the Pulse Mines and their marauding bombs. Battlestar is based on the game Uridium where you view your craft from above and you scroll horizontally left or right constantly in the direction you travel. As you blast the mines you must also avoid the encasements sticking up as well as bombs moving across the screen. Hitting an object loses you some shields but the faster you travel the less shields you will lose. Once you lose five shields then you lose one of five lives.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Davison", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bYWlbw6dNo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152142-battlestar\n"}
