{"altername_name": ["Fingers Malone"], "name": "The Exploits of Fingers Malone", "overview": "Your aim in this single screen platform game spread over 15 levels is to collect all the money that was stolen in various bank raids. You must navigate the various platforms attempting to collect all the keys to the safe before finding the exit. There are various creatures roaming around the screen as well who don't want their money taken and if you touch one then you lose one of seven lives and the screen you're on has to be started again. To move up and down platforms there are poles that you can only use in the direction it is moving and there are also lifts to move to other parts of the screen. Once you have opened the safe and collected the money, before exiting you must make sure all the platforms have been changed from black to white.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "British Software", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136678-the-exploits-of-fingers-malone\n"}
