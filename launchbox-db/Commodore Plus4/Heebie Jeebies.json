Each section of the vault contains a treasure chest which can only be removed by pushing it along the corridors to the shimmering exit portal. Pushing is the only way to move the chest and his success will depend on the strategy used to plan a route to the exit. His progress along the corridors will be hindered by the guardians of the vault and if Doc should come into contact with any of them his energy will be seriously drained; when all his energy runs out he will lose a life.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stuart Hall", "publishers": "LiveWire Software UK", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuE6tYBQmI8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165123-heebie-jeebies\n"}
