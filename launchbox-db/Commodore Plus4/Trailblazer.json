{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trailblazer", "overview": "An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump and thus avoid these holes, although you have a limited number of them for each level, and it's possible to adjust the speed through joystick or keyboard control. You also face a time limit on each of the levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr. Chip Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailblazer_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsVr1FkQLZA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114211-trailblazer\n"}
