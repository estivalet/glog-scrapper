{"altername_name": ["Blitz 16"], "name": "Aeroblitz", "overview": "Italian take on the blitz genre. An airplane flies across the screen above a city. When the plane reaches the far end of the screen, it reappears on the other end, but at a lower altitude since it is running out of fuel. The objective is to drop bombs on the city to destroy all buildings so that the plane may land on level ground.
