{"altername_name": [], "name": "Powerball", "overview": "Powerball is a platform game where you control a ball and collect chalices over eight levels as the screen scrolls from left to right when you move. Your ball will bounce to the left or the right when you move the joystick and pressing fire will allow it to bounce higher. You lose one of four lives if you hit anything sharp or fall to the bottom of the screen. If you do lose your lives you can start the game again from where you last died or start at the beginning of the level.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136693-powerball\n"}
