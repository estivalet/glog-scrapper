{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Return of Rockman", "overview": "In this sequel to the Boulder Dash clone, Rockman, you once again try to get all the diamonds in ten multi-directional scrolling caverns. Each level as well as the diamonds have a number of hazards which need to be avoided and they are boulders, bows, holes and radioactive waste. The main hazard are the boulders and when you walk underneath clearing the dirt they will fall if a gap appears and any stacked on top will fall downwards where there is no dirt and will kill you if they fall on you. Bows cannot be touched, holes move randomly and are fatal to the touch and radioactive waste spreads where there is no dirt and although not fatal can dissolve boulders causing others to fall. If you get hit by a boulder, touch a bow or a hole then you lose one of four lives.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136698-the-return-of-rockman\n"}
