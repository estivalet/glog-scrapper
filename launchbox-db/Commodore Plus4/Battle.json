{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle", "overview": "Battle is a strategy war game set in the icy waters of the North Sea and has two oil drilling companies fighting over the last remaining deposits of oil. Played against another player or the computer, each player has to destroy the other players ships, aircrafts and oil rigs by moving their ships and aircraft around a top view single screen. Each player is equipped with four ships, two submarines, a helicopter and plane to defend four oil rigs and attempt to destroy the other players crafts. The game is split into two phases, Input Phase and Action Phase with each player taking it in turns to input their commands. Each player cycles through their various icons depicting their crafts and the player can move them around the screen, dive and surface (submarines), land and take-off (aircraft) and fire their various weapons. If a craft hits an oil rig then both are destroyed. Once both players have given their commands then the Action Phase consists of a small pause before the screen shows all the new positions.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ken Smith", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123616-battle\n"}
