{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fury", "overview": "Fury is a single screen platform game connected by ladders, where you play the role of a survivor from a thermonuclear war forced to live underground in a network of tunnels. Unfortunately you share the tunnels with Mutants who are out to kill you so you must fight back with a limited supply of dynamite. To kill a Mutant you place the dynamite on the platform and move to a safe distance and part of the platform will disappear. Any Mutants that fall in the gap will die and once all Mutants are killed then you move to the next screen. If you are trapped by gaps then you can place new platforms and if you touch any Mutants you lose one of five lives. Before the start of the game you can select your skill level (1-5) with one being the easiest.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136657-fury\n"}
