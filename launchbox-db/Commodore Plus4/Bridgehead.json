{"altername_name": ["Bridgehead: Legionnaire 2"], "name": "Bridgehead", "overview": "After your success in Legionnaire, your new mission is now to secure a Bridgehead before making your way to the Enemy Headquarters over various levels. Inspired by the arcade game Green Beret, your marine is viewed from the side and you run along to the right killing as many of the enemies with your knife as you can. There are occasional platforms that appear which can be climbed by ladders and mines can appear on the floor blocking your route. The mines can be removed by throwing a limited amount of grenades but more can be collected on the way. Once you reach the end of a level you have to kill a certain amount of soldiers to move to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00f6rg Dierks", "publishers": "Anco Software Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVfrsXrvM-k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114872-bridgehead\n"}
