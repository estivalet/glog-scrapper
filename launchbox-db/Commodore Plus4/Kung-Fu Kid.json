{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kung-Fu Kid", "overview": "You have upset and failed to impress Emperor To-Ming, and so he has sent you all the way down to the eighth skill level, the ultimate humiliation. To progress back up the skill levels you must defeat a certain amount of minion's before facing a Guardian Lizard and defeating it to move to the next level. The game is viewed from the side and as you walk left or right, waves of minions come running at you from either edge of the screen. You can kick or punch them and they disappear with one hit. As you defeat the minions, an enemy bar increases and when full, the levels Guardian Lizard appears. If you are touched or hit at any time, then an energy bar decreases and when this empties then you lose one of four lives and the enemy bar goes back to empty.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136666-kung-fu-kid\n"}
