{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baby Berks", "overview": "Your mission is to move around a single screen in a craft blasting all the Baby Berks over 16 levels. Most of the Berks are in an egg and you have to wait for them to hatch before you can blast them. Using your weapon though loses you energy shown by a gauge on the bottom of the screen. Big Berks move around as well but these can't be killed, just stunned. If you touch a Baby Berk, Big Berk, egg or run out of energy then you lose one of five lives. There are five skill levels to choose from and they are Duffer, Novice, Normal, Expert and Master.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Williams", "publishers": "Alpha Omega Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk1Kv44qXE4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123623-baby-berks\n"}
