{"altername_name": [], "name": "International Karate", "overview": "The core game is a two-dimensional, one-on-one, versus fighting game. Players take on the roles of martial artists competing in a kumite tournament. Rather than wearing down an opponent's health, the goal is instead to score single solid hits. After each hit, combat stops and both combatants are returned to their starting positions. Depending on how well players hit their opponent, they score either a half-point or a full point. Matches can be quite brief, as only two full points are required to win, and a point can be quickly scored just seconds after a round begins.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "System 3 Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Endurance Games", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Karate", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ads26j0zY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84503-international-karate\n"}
