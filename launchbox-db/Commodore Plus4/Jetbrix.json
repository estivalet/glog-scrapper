{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jetbrix", "overview": "Jetbrix is a single screen side view shooter where you control a spaceman with a jet-pack who has to make a hole through the bottom of a brick wall on the bottom of the screen over various levels. To do this, you have to collect spinners and bombs, then drop them on to the wall while avoiding falling bricks which settle on the wall and makes the wall higher. The spinners can remove the bricks but cannot remove the bottom row but the bombs can remove the bottom row of bricks. You are armed with a laser to shoot the falling bricks but if you touch one then you lose one of seven lives. You can also move on to the next level if you survive a level when a clock reaches zero.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mr Chip Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136664-jetbrix\n"}
