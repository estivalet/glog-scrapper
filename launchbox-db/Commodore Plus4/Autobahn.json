{"altername_name": [], "name": "Autobahn", "overview": "Autobahn is a car racing game. Keyboard or joystick control as well as track B, A and E can be chosen at the beginning. You can drive over 170 on a very wide street. The faster you drive, the farther to the left on the screen you are. Avoiding hitting other cars gets more difficult that way. The most important utility at your disposal is the very small radar screen at the top of the screen. Most of the time you spend looking at the radar to see when cars are about to hit you, so you can slow down and avoid them.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV0JfxEBvGw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136611-autobahn\n"}
