{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxions", "overview": "Galaxions is inspired by the arcade game Galaxian where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen moving left or right, blasting aliens above. The aliens fly onto the screen in various waves firing their lasers at you before sitting in formation, and once all the aliens are in formation, various aliens will swoop down firing their lasers. If you touch an alien or its laser then you lose one of four lives and once all the aliens are destroyed then you move to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John P.
