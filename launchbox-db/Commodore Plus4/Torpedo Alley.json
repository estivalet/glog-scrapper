{"altername_name": [], "name": "Torpedo Alley", "overview": "You are the commander of a submarine and it's your mission to fire torpedoes and destroy a convoy of ships in this single screen 1st person game. You look through your periscope and when any ship comes into view you fire your torpedoes but once the torpedoes have been fired you can't fire anymore until they hit or miss the ships. As you attempt to destroy ships, an anti-aircraft alert will occasionally start flashing meaning a plane will soon fly across the screen. You must dive under the water and wait until you think it safe to re-surface. If you see the plane then that means the plane has spotted you and it is game over. There are five skill levels (1-5) to choose from with one being the easiest.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155625-torpedo-alley\n"}
