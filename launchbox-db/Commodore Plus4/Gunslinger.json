{"altername_name": ["Waffenslinger"], "name": "Gunslinger", "overview": "You are Jesse James and you are hunting outlaws in a frontier town to make yourself $10 for every Outlaw killed to make your fortune. The game is a flick-screen game viewed from a 3rd person perspective behind Jesse, with the town in the back of the screen. The town is made up of five screens, and arrows pointing to the left and the right at the top of the screen flash to show which direction to move to the next Outlaw. Once you find an outlaw, you must face him in line and move your gun up or down to kill him before he kills you. Your gun has seven bullets in it and to get more bullets for your gun you receive one bullet for shooting an outlaw or you move to the far right screen and reload all seven by touching your horse. If you are shot by an outlaw, then you lose one of three lives, but your gun is reloaded. After losing all three lives, it is game over, but your total money received stays for the next games. The game was also published by both Tynesoft and Quellesoft in Germany under the name Waffenslinger.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Davison", "publishers": "QuelleSoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XjxO2oWQds", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164437-gunslinger\n"}
