{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goldrush", "overview": "Goldrush is a top view single screen shooter inspired by the arcade game Asteroids where you have to destroy an asteroid over various levels. When you hit the asteroid it breaks into smaller pieces which also need blasting and you have to destroy every piece before the screen, which is decreasing, closes. If you touch an asteroid then you lose one of six lives but you can thrust forwards to avoid them but cannot stop, just change direction. The further you progress, the more large asteroids start on the screen.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136660-goldrush\n"}
