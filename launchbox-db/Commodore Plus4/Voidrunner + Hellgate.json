{"altername_name": ["Voidrunner/Hellgate"], "name": "Voidrunner + Hellgate", "overview": "The final conflict in the droid wars is up ahead in Jeff Minter's Voidrunner, the second sequel to Gridrunner. After the defeat in the Matrix wars the droids are out for revenge, preparing a nuke to destroy the earth. Therefore a corps of pilots are sent to the droid home planet with the objective to eliminate every single droid. Gameplay is similar to Gridrunner. Like in Centipede, the enemies move in a pattern down the screen and the player has to shoot them before they reach the ship. There's also the zapper, a vertically moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happens, it will die. In Hellgate, The Zzyaxians want to destroy Earth but don't want to appear near the planet as the chances of success are slim. They have decided that they will Hyper-Space near Pluto and create a surprise attack. Problem for them is that while they are zooming towards our Solar System, we have detected them arriving and where their re-entry point will be. Quickly a Hellgate has been built surrounding the re-entry point and it is up to you to control four laser heads on the walls of the gate and blast anything that appears.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LLamasoft", "publishers": "Ariolasoft UK", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369784-voidrunner-hellgate\n"}
