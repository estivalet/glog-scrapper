{"altername_name": [], "name": "Danger Zone", "overview": "After 112 years of design and building by The Galactic Patrol, a prototype of the fighter/reconnaissance ship XT/99 has been completed. After extensive testing with computer simulations, the ship is passing all the tests but to really know it's capabilities it has to be flown for real in a combat zone. You have been chosen to take the ship for a test flight by flying into the combat zone and trying to get it out in one piece. Danger Zone is a side view shooter where you control the ship on the left of the screen, moving it up or down, while various spacecraft and small asteroids fly across the screen from right to left. You must blast or avoid the crafts but the asteroids cannot be destroyed and if you are hit by a craft or asteroid then you lose part of your shield and when it is gone then you lose one of three lives. As you use your lasers then your energy will drain and when this is empty you lose a life but when you don't fire then it will increase.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO6tBnUrwVs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136650-danger-zone\n"}
