{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xargon's Revenge", "overview": "Your people have won the war against Xargon and now in one last attack you have been tasked to destroy their planet and their four satellite planets in your spacecraft. Problem is, the Xargon's have been warned you are coming and so have sent all their Warriors to defend the planets against your attack. Xargon's Revenge is a shooter viewed from the side on a single screen for each planet. You sit on the left on the screen blasting the Warriors who move from right to left in unpredictable patterns and if you touch one then you lose one of five lives. Every Warrior must be destroyed on each screen to progress to the next but it has to be done before your fuel gauge runs out. Fuel capsules though occasionally bounce towards you and if collected increase your fuel as running out of fuel loses a life.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Projects", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136727-xargons-revenge\n"}
