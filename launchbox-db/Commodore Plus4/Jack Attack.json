{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jack Attack", "overview": "This is a simple action game where your aim is to crush 8 spinning heads in each level. This can be done by either jumping on them or pushing blocks on them. While the first level is pretty basic with just a few blocks to move, later levels feature platforms and water, which is fatal to the character. Besides water, the spinning heads themselves are the main threat as they can kill Jack by jumping on him. Jack can push blocks on the water which will then float, allowing him to walk on them.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Traynor", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Attack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uroDciVw6UU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126823-jack-attack\n"}
