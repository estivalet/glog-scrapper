{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roller Kong", "overview": "Roller Kong is a single screen platform game based on the arcade game Donkey Kong where you have to rescue a maiden at the top of the screen. Holding her hostage is a giant ape and you have to get from the bottom of the screen climbing ladders to rescue her before a spider moves from the right of the screen and gets her. To stop you the ape will throw barrels which move along the platforms and down the ladders as well as fireballs which move diagonally across the screen. If you touch a barrel or a fireball then you lose one of three lives but the barrels can be stopped when you collect an axe for a short time but you can't climb ladders. Flowers can also be collected along the way for extra points. Once you rescue the maiden then you move on to the next level which has elevators replacing ladders and now the ape throws monsters called Spinks but there is no spider.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136701-roller-kong\n"}
