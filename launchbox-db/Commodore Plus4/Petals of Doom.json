{"altername_name": [], "name": "Petals of Doom", "overview": "You are on a strange alien world trapped in a network of caverns which are connected by energy curtains and they can only be opened by making sure all plants in the cavern are fully grown. Viewed from the side as the screen scrolls left and right when you move, Petals of Doom has you having to blast the creatures that dwell in the caverns, making sure they don't stamp on the plants. Before you play the game you decide how many lives you require from one to six. As you protect each plant, they will grow over time, and when all have grown you can move to the next cavern but will shrink when touched by an alien. The growth of the plants is indicated by a bar and when it empties then the plants have fully grown. Another bar to watch is your power bar and this decreases if you touch an alien, fire your laser or fly your jet-pack and when empty you lose a life but will increase if you aren't touched or don't use your laser or jet-pack. When tall enough, the plants can be stood behind and the aliens can't touch you. A radar at the top of the screen shows the location of any aliens and the keyboard or joystick is used to control your hero.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Micro Projects", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136686-petals-of-doom\n"}
