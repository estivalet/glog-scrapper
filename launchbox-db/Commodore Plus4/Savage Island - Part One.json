{"altername_name": ["Savage Island", "Savage Island (Part 1)"], "name": "Savage Island: Part One", "overview": "Savage Island is the only multi-part game in Scott Adams' adventure series, all of which have a very similar parser and interface. At the completion of this game, players receive a password which allows part two to be played. The Savage Island games are also probably the most difficult adventures in the series! The player begins trapped on a small remote island in the ocean, which is facing a hurricane and also has an active volcano. The player can cross a river, and will also need to explore a cave network. Items are often found by running through the sand with one's hands. The island holds a great secret, which will not be discovered until both parts of the game have been completed.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Adventure International", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136703-savage-island-part-one\n"}
