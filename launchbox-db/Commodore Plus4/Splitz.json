{"altername_name": [], "name": "Splitz", "overview": "Splitz is a single screen platformer for the C16 and Plus/4 computers where the aim is to build the next level by collecting tokens. The screen is split into two vertical halves and you play in one of the halves moving around platforms and climbing ladders. The tokens needed are scattered around the screen and you can only collect one at a time and once you have a token you must place it into a pipe. The token moves through the pipe and part of the next level appears in the other half of the screen. There are two types of creatures that move around the screen with one fatal to touch and you lose one of eight lives when touched, and one that takes the token you are holding and places it elsewhere on the screen. The next level must be built before a clock runs down to zero and once completed you play the new level trying to build another one.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alpha Omega Software", "publishers": "The Power House", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml74Lq70Egg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107307-splitz\n"}
