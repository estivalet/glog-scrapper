{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sword of Destiny", "overview": "You are Kalok and you fought so hard and so brave but in the end the evil warlock, Xorphas finally defeated you and killed you. Problem is instead of your soul going to warrior heaven, Xorphas has sought revenge by stealing your heart which means your soul is destined to wander for ever in Limbo. You still have the Sword of Destiny so you decide that you will descend into the depths of the Warlock's lair, The Abyss of Death and get your heart back. You must fight off evil nasties as well as find flashing objects which open up more of the Abyss. Scattered around are small volcano type mounds and when you jump on them they allow you to jump up higher. Touch any nasty or fall from a height then your Astral power bar will decrease slightly. When it is empty it is game over. Sword of Destiny is a one player flick-screen platform game. You use a joystick or the keyboard to control your hero.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Micro Projects", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136714-sword-of-destiny\n"}
