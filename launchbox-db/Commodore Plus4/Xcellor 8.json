{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xcellor 8", "overview": "You are a Bounty Hunter and in your XK155 Hover-Car you travel around the city of Xcellor8 looking for criminals called Runners. When you have found and shot a Runner you can then go to the bank to collect your money as your reward. The more Runners you catch the more money you make. At the bank you must try to get to a counter as quick as possible as the reward gets lower. You have to select a queue and you can keep changing queues to move to a faster one. Any money you collect can now be spent at the shop to upgrade your car or purchase fuel. The longer you drive the more fuel you consume so you must keep an eye on your fuel gauge or it's game over. If you hit anything then your shield gauge will get smaller as well as your gun-charge when you use your gun. Be careful not to hit any innocent droids as they need to be taken to a hospital to repair if you have enough money. Hit three droids and it's game over. Xcellor8 is a multi-scrolling game with the screen scrolling as you move viewed from above. You control the hover-car and your droid in the bank queue with a joystick. As well as the main playing area you can also see your money, innocents hit, Runners killed, your shield, gun-charge and fuel gauges. There is also a scanner showing where the Runners and Innocent droids are.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Patrick Strassen", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136617-xcellor-8\n"}
