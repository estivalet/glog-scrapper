{"altername_name": ["The Exorcist"], "name": "Exorcist", "overview": "Exorcist is a Pac-Man variant. The player takes control of Sparkie, a blobby yet spikey character who is lost in the haunted catacombs beneath the ruins of an old monastery. Ghosts and other nasty creatures wander around the corridors of the catacombs and now Sparkie has to find a way to escape. Unlike Pac-Man, Exorcist doesn't feature any pills that has to be collected. Instead the idea here is to illuminate all of the walls of the mazes. This is done automatically as the player moves Sparkie through the corridors. When a maze is fully lit the ghosts will be exorcised and a number of exists will open up and the player can move on to other mazes. All mazes are connected to each other and the player can move back and forth between them. If Sparkie comes into contact with the ghosts he will have to restart the maze and he will lose some of his energy. When all energy is lost the game is over. It is possible to shoot at the ghosts by picking up lightning that can be found in each maze. This causes the ghosts to slow down but it can only be used for a few second before it disappears. Energy can be replenished by shooting the exorcised ghosts.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr. Micro", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines (UK)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Ouk0EyKA4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136654-exorcist\n"}
