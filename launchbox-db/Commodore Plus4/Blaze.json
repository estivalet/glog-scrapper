{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blaze", "overview": "The ultimate test for any Space-Cadet of the Fleet is to fly through the Blaze Zone in the Andromeda System. The zone is packed full of defences and aliens that need shooting to hopefully emerge on the other side. The game is a shooter where you move a spacecraft on the bottom of the single screen left or right, and the aim is to shoot the various items and aliens that appear on the screen. You have to shoot everything on the screen to move to the next one. If you touch anything then you lose one of five lives. The game's tape has versions for both the C64 and C16/Plus4 on it", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Craig Douglas", "publishers": "Romik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123633-blaze\n"}
