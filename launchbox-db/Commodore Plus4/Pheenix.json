{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pheenix", "overview": "Pheenix is a clone of the arcade shooter Phoenix: In five different screens, you have to shoot various flying entities whose droppings prove harmful for your spaceship. Luckily, you can activate a shield that will protect your vessel for a short time (you can't shoot during that time either though). While the five different screens are similar, each one is unique in its way: In the first two you have to shoot bat-like creatures that line up on the screen not unlike in another arcade classic from the era, Galaxian. In the third and fourth screen, you first see eggs flying around before birds hatch and start unloading on you. And in the fifth screen, you have to destroy a large, heavily shielded enemy mothership. If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty. To defeat the numerous enemies, your ship is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field. If you get hit by an alien or an alien projectile, then you lose one of four lives, once all lives are spent, it is game over. Originally a 1983 ZX Spectrum game, the Commodore 16/Plus4 version was ported by Ultra Soft and released by Alternative Software in 1986.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ultra Soft", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Ci_iq9VxE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159471-pheenix\n"}
