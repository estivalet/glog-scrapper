{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gwnn", "overview": "GWNN is a top view horizontal shooter where you fly left to right, or right to left over an alien base to complete six missions to finally destroy the base. Each mission has you attempting to complete a task which are, rescue scientists, destroy a generator, pick up autofire, destroy an ammo dump, fuel up and destroy the actual base. The items that need collecting are represented by letters and just need flying over to collect. As you fly you will encounter aliens moving across the screen as well as raised obstacles and touching any of these decrease a energy gauge. If this empties then you lose one of three lives but collecting the letter E increases it. If you complete a mission then you move to a bonus stage which sees you collecting bonus points.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136662-gwnn\n"}
