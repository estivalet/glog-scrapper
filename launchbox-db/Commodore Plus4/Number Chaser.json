{"altername_name": [], "name": "Number Chaser", "overview": "Number Chaser is a educational maths driving game where your sat behind a racing car at an elevated angle. The idea of the game is to drive so many miles estimating the answer to a sum, in the quickest time. Before you start the race you can choose your car depending on the speed you want to drive and whether you want a full race or just practise. At the start of the race you start to accelerate and drive along a road split into four lanes where you can move left or right into them. A sum appears at the bottom of the screen and at the bottom of each lane is an estimation of the answer. You drive in a lane with what you think is the correct answer for half a mile before the answer is revealed. If correct you keep driving with a new sum, get it wrong and you are stopped and a Marshall appears telling you the correct answer. As you drive, every five miles an obstacle starts to appear and they are oil-slicks which mix the answers when hit, rocks which stop you and give a new sum, and finally night driving where you have to drive in a lane to reveal one of the answers. At the end of the race you enter the pits to be given a score.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Applied Systems Knowledge", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136682-number-chaser\n"}
