{"altername_name": ["G-Man"], "name": "'g'man", "overview": "As a newly qualified graduate of the Space Geology College, things are looking good for G Man as he explores the Sea of Dreams on the Moon. Looking for samples and using a jet-pac, G Man is having so much fun he forgot the timings of the Moonbus back to Earth. It has left his location and landed 4 Km away and will take-off again in seven minutes back to Earth. In this side view left to right constantly scrolling game, you control G Man as you try to fly and run on the surface of the moon back to the Moonbus. As well as the dangers on the surface like gaps to clear, there are also meteors flying in the sky from right to left. You must use your jet-pac to avoid the gaps and the meteors being aware of the momentum when moving and gravity pulling you downwards. You can speed up when flying but any use of the jet-pac uses fuel but there are fuel dumps which can be collected.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136679-gman\n"}
