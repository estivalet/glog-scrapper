{"altername_name": [], "name": "Prospector Pete", "overview": "Prospector Pete is a game heavily influenced by the game O'Riley's Mine where you control Prospector Pete over 16 mines trying to collect gold, as well as gas and oil. The game is viewed from the side with the majority of the level shown on the screen with the screen scrolling to the left or right. You must collect all the gold on each level before a ladder appears at the top of the screen to exit the mine. As you start tunneling around the level, a stick of dynamite will blow and rising water will fill a tunnel and flow around all tunnels you have made, touch the water and you lose one of three lives. Also meanies will roam the tunnels and you lose a life as well if touched. To help you against the meanies you have a limited number of dynamite which can be dropped to stop them.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "British Software", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136695-prospector-pete\n"}
