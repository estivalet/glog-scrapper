{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zagan Warrior", "overview": "Zagan Warrior is a 1st person perspective shooter where you are an elite Zagan Warrior and you must ride your Zagan Chaser around the Crystal Forest on the planet Sirus 3 blasting Tycons. You are able to steer left or right, and accelerate or decelerate your chaser as you look for Tycons riding around. As soon as you are sitting on the chaser then your energy decreases and you must destroy a certain amount of Tycons to move to the next level. To fire your weapon you must be travelling at full speed but you must look out for poles moving towards you. As you fire at the Tycons, they will fire back and if you are hit by their weapon, hit a pole or run out of energy then you lose one of three lives. Occasionally a Mothership will appear and destroying this gives you bonus points.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bug-Byte Software", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136728-zagan-warrior\n"}
