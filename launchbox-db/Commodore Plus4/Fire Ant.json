{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire Ant", "overview": "You control an ant that must rescue the queen ant taken hostage by a group of scorpions. She is being held in the eighth chamber, but to reach her, you must navigate a series of tunnels that are being patrolled by the scorpions, and use objects scattered throughout the chambers to proceed to the next one. These objects include getting keys that will open yellow doors, and explosives that will detonate walls. Objects placed at the proper locations usually cause a chain reaction that clears the obstacles. Occasionally, scorpions are seen laying eggs, and getting these eggs will award you with bonus points. When the queen ant is rescued, the game resets to the first chamber.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Commodore", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hNM_JcaoRg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114171-fire-ant\n"}
