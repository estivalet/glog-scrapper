{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bubble Trouble", "overview": "In Bubble Trouble the player controls a bubble in the bath who longs for freedom. The problem: only big bubbles float away so the goal is to increase in size while avoiding all sorts of deadly obstacles. The bath is viewed from the side and the player's bubble is controlled with the joystick. Smaller bubbles rise up from the ground, nine of which must be eaten within a time limit of 60 seconds to advance to the next level. Besides some nasties already present in the bath, from time to time some bathroom accessories like nail brushes or shampoo will fall down and must be avoided. Only the soap can also be eaten for bonus points.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Paul Jones", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUIpFDM8QRk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151532-bubble-trouble\n"}
