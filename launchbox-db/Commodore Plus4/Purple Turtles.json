{"altername_name": [], "name": "Purple Turtles", "overview": "Purple Turtles (Purpilious Turtiliorum) are used in the sport of Turtle Bobbing where four of the turtles are placed in water, in a row to make a bridge in this side view single screen game. You are the next competitor and you must cross a river five times from the left, to the other side and back, bringing back a piece of fruit from a tree before a timer runs out. What makes the sport more interesting is the fact that the turtles like to occasionally move to the bottom of the river and back up to the surface randomly. If you touch the water then you lose a life (three on the C64, five on the C16) and you start on the left of the river again with any fruit collected lost. The first few levels has just one turtle moving up and down, but later levels has multiple turtles moving. Before the start of the game you can select the starting level (0-9). The game is very similar to the Nintendo Game & Watch game Turtle Bridge which came out in 1982.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Moore", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdEQ7dKUSo8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117550-purple-turtles\n"}
