{"altername_name": ["Winter Olympiade"], "name": "Winter Events", "overview": "Winter Events is a multi-sport event game heavily influenced by the classic Winter Games. The game allows you and three other friends to select a country before competing in six Olympic events which are Biathlon, Slalom Skiing, Ski Jumping, Speed Skating, Bobsleigh and Downhill Skiing. (Downhill Skiing not on Atari 8-Bit) In each event you have to use a combination of different control movements and fire button action to control each player. As well as competing in all six events, you can compete in one or practise any event as well. If competing, at the end of each event you will see a medal ceremony and the winner is the one who wins the most medals.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "September 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Udo Gertz", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20xxVGP8xUM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31942-winter-events\n"}
