{"altername_name": ["BMX Racer"], "name": "BMX Racers", "overview": "There you are having a nice ride through the park when suddenly you can't stop peddling and your brakes stop working. All you can do is avoid all obstacles and hope for the best as you get faster and faster. The game is viewed from a overhead view as you cycle up the winding path. There are bridges to cross rivers, lakes, trees and bushes, fences and even car parks full of cars to avoid. After each level you get a small rest before once again your propelled forward, but this time much faster and the obstacles become more and more. While all this is going on your score keeps getting bigger until you crash. You only have one life before you start all over again to get further and beat your last score.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136646-bmx-racers\n"}
