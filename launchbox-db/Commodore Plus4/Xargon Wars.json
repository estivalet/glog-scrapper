{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xargon Wars", "overview": "Xargon Wars is a shoot-em-up in the style of the arcade game Astro Blaster where you are a gunnery commander and you must use your gun to defend your planet from wave after wave of alien invaders. There are 16 waves of aliens to blast and all aliens must be destroyed on each level to move to the next. Be careful not to over use your cannon as it can overheat and then you will have to wait for it to cool. A gauge on the right of the playing area shows your gun temperature. You can select from one to four lives and it is game over when all are lost.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136726-xargon-wars\n"}
