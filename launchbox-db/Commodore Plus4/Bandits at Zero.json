{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bandits at Zero", "overview": "Bandits at Zero is a side view horizontal scrolling shooter. Your mission is to find and destroy an aircraft carrier somewhere out at sea over the course of a few days. The screen scrolls left or right constantly in the direction you are traveling. You must fly over the sea and survive every day and night until it is found while avoiding and shooting enemy planes. At the bottom of the screen is a radar which shows you the position of the enemy planes and as you fight the day slowly turns to night and back again. Flying decreases a fuel gauge slowly but once night turns back to day you have a chance to re-fuel with another plane by flying behind it. If you are shot by a plane or touch one, then you lose one of seven shields and if they run out or your fuel then it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117714-bandits-at-zero\n"}
