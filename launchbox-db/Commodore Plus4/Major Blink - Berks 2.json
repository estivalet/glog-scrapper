{"altername_name": ["Major Blink"], "name": "Major Blink: Berks 2", "overview": "After all the Berks were destroyed in Berks, the creator Major Blink has decided to become a painter to make a living. You control Major Blink over various single screens full of different size blocks and paint them. To paint a block you have to paint all the sides which will complete the whole block but there are Teddies moving around the screen removing your work. Also moving around are Drones, sent by your previous employers who weren't happy at your failure but you do have a double laser to help. The Teddies can be destroyed but the Drones can only be stunned and if you touch the Teddies or Drones then you lose one of five lives. If you stand at the top of the screen in the red zone, no more Teddies will appear and once all the blocks are painted then you move to the next screen. There are five skill levels to choose from and they are Duffer, Novice, Normal, Expert and Master.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CRL Group", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155609-major-blink-berks-2\n"}
