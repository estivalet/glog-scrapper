{"altername_name": ["Pizza Pete"], "name": "Pizza Pete.", "overview": "Things aren't going well for Luigi, production at the bakery has halted so he is unable to make his pizza on the night shift. The only solution is to call in Pizza Pete to break into the bakery and make the pizza himself. The game is a single screen platformer inspired by the arcade game BurgerTime, where you have to run along platforms and climb ladders to make the pizza. Each screen is made up of four rows of platforms and on each level is an ingredient, the base, cheese, tomato and salami. Controlling Pete, you run over the ingredients which pushes them down to the next row and pushes any other ingredients below, downwards. As you make the pizza there are various items moving around the screen like sausages, spoons, bottles and onions, and if you touch one then you lose one of five lives. Pete is able to make his hat bigger and this makes him immune for a short period shown by a clock at the bottom of the screen. Pete only has four hats but can get more when his assistant, Sophia, runs across the screen and is touched. Sometimes Sophia won't give you a hat, and you can't get another one if your hat is big.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dog Rigby", "publishers": "Illusion Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=7NgZaMszlEk&t=3s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164535-pizza-pete\n"}
