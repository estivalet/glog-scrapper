{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Magicians Curse", "overview": "A once prosperous land inhabited by an evil wizard has stayed uninhabited long after he left. There are tales though that he left behind in his lair a golden statue which is priceless. You play as an adventurer who has entered the land looking for the buried treasure. The game is a flick-screen arcade adventure viewed from the side with elements of a platform game. There are eight skill levels to choose from and when the game is completed you start again on a higher skill level. As you explore you will encounter buildings to explore as well as creatures and objects that will harm you. As you move about, you have a strength gauge which is slowly decreasing but you can find potions and food to keep it topped up. Touching creatures like bats or items like falling apples and water will decrease the gauge further and be wary of certain potions that are poison and an antidote needs to be found before you die and it's game over. To succeed in your quest, certain items need to be found before you can get to the statue which are seven talismans scattered all over the surrounding area, two keys to unlock doors to enter buildings, and a candle to see in the underground section. A joystick or keyboard can be used to control your hero.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152329-the-magicians-curse\n"}
