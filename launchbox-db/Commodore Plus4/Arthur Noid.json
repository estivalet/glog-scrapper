{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arthur Noid", "overview": "Arthur Noid ======== Arthur noid is a bat and ball game with 32 levels (including bonus levels). The game is based on the arcade game Arkanoid and sees you controlling a bat on the bottom of the screen, bouncing a ball upwards to remove blocks above. As you remove the blocks, a barrel will appear and fall downwards and if collected will give you a power-up and these include large bat, shoot blocks, 3 balls, slow ball and an extra bat. Occasionally a Floboid moves across the screen and if hit with the ball will give you bonus points. If you let the ball go past the bat then you lose one of six lives and you have to clear all the blocks to move to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shaun Southern", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqsBG1t88J0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117713-arthur-noid\n"}
