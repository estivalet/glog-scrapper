{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sea Strike", "overview": "Sea Strike is a side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls left or right when you move, and your mission in your Sea Harrier Jet is to bomb and destroy a convoy. You start hovering above a re-fuelling ship and you must fly across the sea searching for ships and bombing them but you must avoid or shoot helicopters that fly across the screen. As you fly and use your ammo, ammo and fuel gauges decrease but you can land on a re-fuelling ship to top these up. If you are shot by a helicopter, crash into a helicopter or touch the water then you lose one of three lives. On the screen is a scanner showing the locations of the ships that need to be bombed.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "RazorSoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136704-sea-strike\n"}
