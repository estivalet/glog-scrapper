{"altername_name": ["Shark Attack"], "name": "Shark", "overview": "The seas of the world are now full of man eating sharks and it's up to you to dive in the seas and kill them all with your harpoon gun. Over various levels you must shoot a shark to move on to the next level. The game is viewed from the side with the whole level shown on the screen. The shark swims at the top of the screen while you can only move left and right on the bottom. You must fire a harpoon upwards to kill him. As you play a level, your air gauge decreases and if you don't kill the shark by the time it reaches zero then you lose one of three lives. As the levels progress then there are other sea creatures to be aware of like eels, fish and squid. These have to be avoided and can't be shot and when touched then you lose a life.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mr. Micro", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136705-shark\n"}
