{"altername_name": [], "name": "Megabolts", "overview": "Your task is to destroy all Megabolts who have invaded your world over 64 screens on a 8x8 grid connected by various passages. The game is a maze game viewed from above with each maze shown on the whole screen and you must control a craft killing all the Megabolt's ships that move about the maze. To kill them you can either shoot them with your laser or you can crush them with part of a wall which you fire at to move. There is also a spinning yellow craft that moves about the maze and this can't be shot just avoided. Touch this spinning craft or a Megabolt and you lose one of six lives. As you move about the maze you have a fuel gauge which is slowly decreasing and when this runs out you lose a live but you can collect moving orange diamonds to increase it. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, lives, high score, how many Megabolts to destroy in that maze, your grid location and an alert which tells you which grids still have Megabolts active.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mr Chip Software", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136672-megabolts\n"}
