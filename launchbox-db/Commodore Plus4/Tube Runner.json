{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tube Runner", "overview": "You are destined to spend your days running within drains and pipes in an labyrinth of an unknown empire so you have decided to escape. The labyrinth is made up of various levels, each one viewed from the side with the screen scrolling in multiple directions when you move, and you must collect all the jewels to move to the next level before a strict time limit reaches zero. As you run around the pipes you use up energy shown by a gauge, and if you touch any creature then this decreases it even further. You are armed with a gun to shoot the creatures but the ammo is limited but extra ammo and energy can be found. Gates can block your path but keys are scattered around each level to collect and open the gates, with lifts to help you get to higher parts of the labyrinth. If your energy runs out or the clock reaches zero then you lose one of four lives.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136719-tube-runner\n"}
