{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cuthbert in the Cooler", "overview": "Bearing only a superficial likeness to the Dragon 32 version, Cuthbert in the Cooler for the Commodore 16 has none of the prison camp theme, instead being a totally independent development that Microdeal saw as sufficiently similar to put the same label on. Gone are the barracks and the prison guards, and instead you run around picking up apples, keys and other items, while laying bombs in labyrinths guarded by skulls, mummies and fires, resulting in a game that is a bit of Oh Mummy and a bit of Mr. Do, while being so simplified that it doesn't equal either.", "platform": "Commodore Plus 4", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155618-cuthbert-in-the-cooler\n"}
