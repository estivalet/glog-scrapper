{"altername_name": [], "name": "Othello", "overview": "Othello is based on the board game where two players try to get the most counters on a 8 x 8 grid. The game starts with each player having two counters in the centre of the board diagonally from each other. Each player then proceeds to place a counter either vertical, horizontal or diagonally from one of their counters with the other players counters in between. Any counters in between then get turned to that players own colour and then it is the next players turn. The game is won when the board is full or both players can't place a counter, and the player with the most is the winner. A player can either play against the computer or another person.", "platform": "Jupiter Ace", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roy Nickson", "publishers": "Jupiter Cantab Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98736-othello\n"}
