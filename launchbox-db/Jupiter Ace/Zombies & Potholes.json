{"altername_name": ["Zombies and Potholes"], "name": "Zombies & Potholes", "overview": "Zombies & Potholes is a single screen game where the aim is to move around the screen avoiding being touched and killed by zombies while trying to get them to fall down potholes. You are able to move up, down, sideways and diagonally in eight directions and you move one place at a time but pressing S allows you to stay in the same spot for a turn. Once you moved one place, then all the zombies on screen move one place towards you. If you have a pothole between you and the zombie then he will fall into it and once the screen is cleared then you add a point to your win score. Get touched by a zombie and you add a point to your lose score. Two players can play and one player keeps playing before allowing the other player a turn. Before the game you can adjust various parameters and they are, Logic (A or B) which allows you to move off the screen and appear on the opposite side or not, Thinking Time (2 - 100) which is how many seconds to move before the zombies do, Packing Density (10 - 100) which is the number of zombies and potholes on screen, and Difficulty Level (10 - 100).", "platform": "Jupiter Ace", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Julian Tippett", "publishers": "Jupiter Cantab", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98773-zombies-potholes\n"}
