{"altername_name": [], "name": "Over Taker + Brands Hatch", "overview": "Overtaker + Brands Hatch is a double game pack that contains two top view driving games. The games are: Overtaker: The aim is to drive up a constantly scrolling road avoiding the other cars for as many points as possible before a clock counts down to zero. You move your car left or right and you can accelerate which makes the other cars appear faster but you receive more points. Brands Hatch: The aim is to drive around a track on a single screen over five laps in the quickest time. You control your car by turning left or right but have no control over the speed. There are other cars that are static in various places on the track and if you hit them or the sides of the track this stops your car.", "platform": "Jupiter Ace", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Jupiter Cantab Ltd.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98738-over-taker-brands-hatch\n"}
