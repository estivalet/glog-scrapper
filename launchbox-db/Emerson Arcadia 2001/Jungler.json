{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jungler", "overview": "Jungler is an arcade game where the player controls a snake-like creature in a maze. In the maze are three other such creatures and the aim of the game is to destroy the other creatures before getting killed by them. The enemies will appear in three different colors with different lengths. The red ones are longer than the player who will be killed upon a head-on collision. The yellow ones are the same length as the player and are harmless. The green ones are shorter than the player and can be killed by colliding with their heads. The enemies can be shot at and if one is hit in its tail its size will decrease by one segment. Creatures that are smaller will move faster and be harder to catch. At the same time it is possible to increase the player's size by eating fruits that appear at random locations but it decreases if hit by the enemy creatures' fire.", "platform": "Emerson Arcadia 2001", "release_date": "November 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UA Limited", "publishers": "Emerson Radio", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungler", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwJqNHv3AoI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76452-jungler\n"}
