{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pleiades", "overview": "This is a sequel to Phoenix. On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them. At some point, an alien will create a shield across the screen just above your ship that will require you to shoot holes through to destroy more aliens.

On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder. There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.", "platform": "Emerson Arcadia 2001", "release_date": "January 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UA Limited", "publishers": "Emerson Radio", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_BIjRlMfk8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76459-pleiades\n"}
