{"altername_name": ["Turpin"], "name": "Turtles", "overview": "Turtles, also known as Turpin, puts you into the role of the materialistic turtle who tries to save the kid turtles from a bunch of bad bugs (or, in some versions, bad cars). It takes place in a Pacman-esque labyrinth, with turtle boxes in the center and corners of the screen. Run into a box to release the turtle kid inside. Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kid turtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the center of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolized by their changing colors. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kid turtles. Watch out! Each level is a floor in a house, and between levels you can see the turtle climbing to the next floor until it reaches the top. However, in the Philips versions, the kid turtles are replaced by people whom the turtle must save from ships, while the bugs are turned into turtle-eating fish.", "platform": "Emerson Arcadia 2001", "release_date": "September 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UA Limited", "publishers": "Hanimex", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgyioUT3H2w&t=20s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76478-turtles\n"}
