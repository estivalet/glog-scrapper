{"altername_name": [], "name": "Route 16", "overview": "Route-16 is a game in which the player drives a car in an attempt to get all of the valuable items on the road whilst avoiding the other cars who attempt to crash into the player's car. The player drives around on a map that shows a bird's eye view of 16 different routes that the player can enter, which contain items that have to be collected. The money bags either give the player 200 or 800 points, the oil spill temporarily slows the player's car down, the checkered flag will turn the tables, turning the opponents into money bags that the player can collect (similar to how the power pellet works in Pac-Man), and bombs will explode the car. After every item is collected, the player moves on to the next stage. When a specific route is entered, the view is switched to a single screen maze. The mazes contain dead-ends, obstacles, and many exits, with the risk of the player's car getting hit by the other cars. The player can speed up his/her car, but this causes the fuel to decrease faster than racing at the usual speed. If fuel runs out, the player loses a life, and when the stage is completed, the remaining amount of fuel gets added to the player's score.", "platform": "Emerson Arcadia 2001", "release_date": "January 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UA Limited", "publishers": "Centuri", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route-16_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3HV7vG_quA&t=61s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75803-route-16\n"}
