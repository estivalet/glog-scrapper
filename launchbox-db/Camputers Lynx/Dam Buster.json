{"altername_name": ["Dam Busters"], "name": "Dam Buster", "overview": "Dam Buster (also released as Dam Busters) is a side view single screen game where you are a pilot from the 617 Squadron in World War II, where your mission is to destroy various dams using a bouncing bomb. Your plane is flying at the top of the screen moving from left to right and reappears back on the left of the screen when it reaches the right side. One of the dams is on the bottom of the screen with the water on the left and you have to fly low and at the right speed to drop the bomb so it will bounce towards the dam and settle at the base of the dam before exploding. Below the water is a green bar which is the drop zone and the bomb can only be released over this. A flak gun on the top of the dam and the right of the dam fire diagonally upwards and you must avoid the flak and not hit the dam either or you lose one of three lives.", "platform": "Camputers Lynx", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Durell Software", "publishers": "Cam Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A69Aa_kSBVQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84201-dam-buster\n"}
