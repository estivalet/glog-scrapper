{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gobble De Spook", "overview": "Gobble De Spook is a Pac-Man variant with the same features as the original. The aim is to achieve a high score by controlling a gobbler that has to collect all the dots in the maze without being caught by the four ghosts that guard it. By eating power point pods the gobbler is empowered and can go after the ghosts for a short while. There are also cherries that can be picked up for extra points. The player has three lives and is given an additional one by by clearing the maze of all the dots. The game features eight skill levels. The most notable difference is that the four hardest levels have invisible maze walls which make it harder to navigate. Less notable is the intelligence of the ghosts. In the easiest level there is just one intelligent ghosts while in the hardest one all ghosts are intelligent.", "platform": "Camputers Lynx", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Camsoft", "publishers": "Camsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84202-gobble-de-spook\n"}
