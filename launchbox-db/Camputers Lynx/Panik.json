{"altername_name": [], "name": "Panik", "overview": "Panik is a clone of Space Panic. Dig holes in the brick levels with your pick and knock the monsters through to kill them. Depending on their ferocity, you have to drop them through 1, 2, or 3 levels to kill them. There are double points for each extra level they drop through. You can also knock them through by jumping on a trapped monster through a hole dug on the level above, but make sure you do so before it starts to climb out of the hole. If you drop one monster onto another, they'll both die. At higher levels, monsters move up to the next level of ferocity if you let them escape from a hole. Don't run out of oxygen, or you'll die (however, do it at least once when you're on the ladders to see what happens!)", "platform": "Camputers Lynx", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M.
