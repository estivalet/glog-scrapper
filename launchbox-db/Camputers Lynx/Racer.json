{"altername_name": [], "name": "Racer", "overview": "Racer is a side scrolling racing game. The player is the driver of a red car which has to be driven from the right to left as far as possible. On the road are numerous other cars that the player has to avoid crashing into. At the same time it's necessary to keep an eye at the car's fuel level since the game ends when the tank is empty. It also ends if the player crashes more than four times. The gas is automatically refueled when reaching certain distances and signs by the side of the road show how far it is to the next station. The player can control the car up and down, accelerate, brake and use a turbo boost.", "platform": "Camputers Lynx", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sian Software", "publishers": "Camsoft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdRWwZAu2Po", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84214-racer\n"}
