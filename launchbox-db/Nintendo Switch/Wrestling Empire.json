{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wrestling Empire", "overview": "Recalling the genre's 64-bit heyday, this is wrestling that puts the fun first - filling the ring with as many wrestlers as you can handle and letting them loose with freestyle animation where anything could happen at any moment. Design matches before your very eyes with the intuitive setup process, and tag in up to 4 controllers at ANY time for old school multiplayer. Or create your own star and embark on a career to encounter up to 350 opponents across 10 different rosters in an endless schedule of possibilities. Make the right moves backstage as well as in the ring to fight for your worth and retire with a career worth remembering. Just when you think you've seen it all, you can even save your changes to each character to make the world your own and never get bored of wrestling again.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "January 11, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MDickie", "publishers": "", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154029-wrestling-empire\n"}
