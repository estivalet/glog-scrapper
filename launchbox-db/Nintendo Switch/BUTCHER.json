So grab your weapon of choice (from chainsaws, to shotguns, to grenade launchers) and kill your way through underground hideouts, post-apocalyptic cities, jungles, and more. And if you\u2019re feeling creative, there are plenty of other ways to end your enemies\u2019 misery \u2013 hooks, lava pits, saws... no death will ever be the same again. If kicking corpses into a lava pit and adorning walls with blood is your idea of a good time, BUTCHER is THE game for you.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 28, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Transhuman Design", "publishers": "Crunching Koalas", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153278-butcher\n"}
