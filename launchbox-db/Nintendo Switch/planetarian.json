Hit by a biological weapon thirty years ago, Sarcophagus City lingered as a vestige manned only by autonomous fighter drones. An exhausted man headed inside a building seeking refuge. Long ago, many would have entered this planetarium, to gaze longingly into the stars, to soothe their sorrows, and to find a sense of peace. In this place of healing, he met a lone girl; a run-down robotic guide who had waited thirty long years for a visitor to come. Her name was Yumemi. Her one wish was for someone to repair the broken projector. Endless rain... The man's fleeting days with Yumemi reminded him of days long gone. As he worked tirelessly to fix that which was broken he wondered, what would he wish for when he finally gazed into those artificial stars?
