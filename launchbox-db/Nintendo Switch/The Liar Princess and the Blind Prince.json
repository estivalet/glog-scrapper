{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince", "overview": "My true self cannot be with you... Seemingly plucked from the pages of an ancient fairy tale, The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince tells the story of a solitary wolf, who sings a beautiful melody in her loneliness, and the young prince who seeks out the voice's origins. Upon finding its source, the prince inadvertently startles the wolf, who blinds him by accident. When the prince is locked away, the wolf seeks to free him and restore his sight. The wolf visits the witch of the forest to receive a human form so that the prince could no longer be harmed. In exchange for her singing voice, the wolf becomes a princess and returns to the blind prince. The two then embark on a dangerous journey to bring the prince to the witch of the forest and heal his eyesight. Transform between the wolf and the princess to solve puzzles and evade traps, collect flowers and petals to unlock fragments of memories, and weave through the dark and dangerous forest to guide the prince toward a cure. But be warned... an all-seeing forest is no place for a blind prince.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "May 31, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "publishers": "NIS America", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liar_Princess_and_the_Blind_Prince", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNr94Nt5miY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113454-the-liar-princess-and-the-blind-prince\n"}
