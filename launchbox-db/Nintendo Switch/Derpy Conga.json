{"altername_name": [], "name": "Derpy Conga", "overview": "Gather all your friends and take them on a journey to save their endangered planet! Take their hand as you find them and form a conga line to be sure not to leave anyone behind but be careful: the longer the line, the harder to control! On the other hand (haha!), certain obstacles are easier to overcome when you have friends on your side. Unique group platforming: Control not one, not two, but a whole bunch of wacky friends\u2026 all at the same time! Different friends, different abilities: On your journey you encounter different kinds of friends: each of them has unique abilities to help you throughout your quest. Derpy puzzles: Use your friends' different abilities to overcome challenges and swing past obstacles. Couch co-op: Invite some (real-life) friends to join you anytime! Dynamic music: A carefully crafted, multi-layered soundtrack that evolves as your conga line gets longer. Cuteness overload: Lovely, animated characters to cheer you up while saving the world. Beautiful alien landscapes: Explore colorful and lively worlds as you travel through space to look out for your friends.
