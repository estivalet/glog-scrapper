{"altername_name": [], "name": "Risk of Rain", "overview": "Risk of Rain is an action platformer with roguelike elements. With permanent death as a primary feature, players will have to play their best to get as far as possible. Fight on a mysterious planet with randomly spawning enemies and bosses, either alone or with 3 friends in online co-op. With over 100 items at your disposal, you will find the tools you need to find the teleporter back home. Discover a myriad of randomly chosen stages, from the desolate forest to the frozen tundra. The three main goals for our game are simple: 1. Design a game that is randomly generated every play-through, to keep replayability high and fresh. 2. Time = difficulty. The higher the in-game time gets, the harder the difficulty gets. Keeping a sense of urgency keeps the game exciting! 3. Be enjoyable, regardless of whether you win or lose. No more fussing with complex and non-intuitive gameplay patterns. Players should not blame the game for their loss!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 20, 2018", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Code Mystics", "publishers": "Hopoo Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_Rain", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113093-risk-of-rain\n"}
