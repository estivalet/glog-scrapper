{"altername_name": [], "name": "DAEMON X MACHINA", "overview": "Defend the planet through high-speed mech action! When the moon tore apart, the sky bled red with light, ushering in an apocalyptic new age... and to survive, you must fight. As a mercenary, defend Earth through high-speed combat against corrupted robots in a series of missions from the cockpit of your Arsenal, a fully customizable mech. Equip your Arsenal with a vast array of parts and weapons, obtain more from downed enemy Arsenals, and swap them on the fly to suit your strategy in the face of ever-rising threats. In this brand-new action game from Kenichiro Tsukuda (Armored Core) and mech designer Shoji Kawamori (Super Dimensional Fortress Macross), your environment is your ally. Collect and use Femto Energy on the field to boost your stats and create powerful mirages; or wield objects like cars and street signs as melee weapons and projectiles. For even more power, upgrade your physical combat abilities and learn new skills through body modification. It\u2019ll also come in handy when you eject from your Arsenal and fight on foot using special weapons and abilities.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 13, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_X_Machina", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3_dAuEqGJo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119037-daemon-x-machina\n"}
