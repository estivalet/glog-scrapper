{"altername_name": [], "name": "FullBlast", "overview": "With an art style inspired by the 80s and the 90s, FullBlast is a vertical-scrolling shooter that will bring a dose of nostalgia to all gamers who spent many an hour at their local arcade, engaging in Shmups. But don\u2019t worry, just because it\u2019s retro in origin, modern conventions and technology have been considered, resulting in a modern and vibrant presentation that is the perfect way to introduce a new generation of gamers to a largely untapped genre. Try to take in as much as you can, when you have the time though. Being a shmup, it\u2019s not just an alien menace you have to worry about, but their projectiles you\u2019ll need to dodge if you hope to survive! Across the game\u2019s 12 random levels, humanity is on the verge of extinction due to an alien invasion and it just so happens, you're the last hope to save the world. So, get ready to take flight and let loose, because those aliens are not going to shoot themselves. Humanity\u2019s retaliation starts here!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 7, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ufo Crash Games", "publishers": "Ufo Crash Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151183-fullblast\n"}
