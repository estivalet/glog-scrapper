{"altername_name": [], "name": "Senran Kagura: Peach Ball", "overview": "Ninja battles, rhythmic cooking contests, water gun fights, massage therapy - what new horizons hasn\u2019t the Senran Kagura series conquered yet? Oh, right: pinball! When amateur chemist Haruka spills a mysterious concoction in the arcade where she works, five of her shinobi friends start acting a little wild. They think they're animals, and the only way to cure them is with Haruka's mystical Peach Ball. The best way to do that? Pinball, of course! Haruka will get the girls onto the tables, but she needs you to work some magic with the flippers and apply the antidote. Use the flippers to bounce the magical Peach Ball all around one of multiple dynamic tables, with a beloved shinobi girl in the middle of it all. Bounce the ball off her knees, feet, or hands to make her shift position and raise the stakes! Feel every shake and bounce with the HD Rumble feature. Build up points to unlock special challenges which showcase the girls' charms!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "July 9, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Tamsoft", "publishers": "Xseed Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senran_Kagura#Senran_Kagura:_Peach_Ball", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPhEghndVI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117818-senran-kagura-peach-ball\n"}
