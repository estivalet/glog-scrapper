{"altername_name": [], "name": "Root", "overview": "Play the digital adaptation of the beloved tabletop board game. Root is a game of adventure and war where 2 to 4 players battle for control of a vast wilderness. The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 16, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Dire Wolf Digital", "publishers": "Dire Wolf Digital", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/root-switch/?sid=277275b0170fec46a16207bae4f6be7d__al", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160968-root\n"}
