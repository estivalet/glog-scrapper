Route trip Akechi Railway", "overview": "The Akechi Tetsudo (Akechi Railway) train makes the journey between Ena and Akechi in Gifu Prefecture, not far from Nagoya. The 50 minute route through the forests, traditional villages and tiny wooden stations is a delight for mountain train enthusiasts and a re-acquaintance with the joys of train travel after the horrors of a packed, sweaty, weekday commute in a subway carriage deep underground. The Akechi Line opened in 1933. The game is a train driving simulation game developed and published by Sonic Powered for the Nintendo Switch exclusively in Japan on August 25, 2022.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 25, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sonic Powered", "publishers": "Sonic Powered", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttAoowN2_LQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369960-railway-japan-route-trip-akechi-railway\n"}
