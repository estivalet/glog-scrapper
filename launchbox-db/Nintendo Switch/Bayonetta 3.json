{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bayonetta 3", "overview": "Bayonetta struts through multiple locations in an all-new, over-the-top climax action game. Sporting a wicked new ensemble and somehow familiar pigtails, the titular Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and time-slowing Witch Time ability. This time, invading manmade bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta\u2019s crosshairs. Tap into Bayonetta\u2019s naughtier side with Demon Masquerade, a new ability that channels the demon linked to her weapon allowing for some exciting action options, not to mention some hair-raising combos. She can also summon her demonic darlings like Gomorrah, Malphas, and Phantasmaraneae during battle, unleashing their demonic powers in the heat of combat and in new, larger-than-life battles where you directly control the action. Fight your way through the streets of Tokyo, the mountains of China, and many other locales! Along the way you\u2019ll meet a virtual coven of Bayonettas, each more fabulous than the last. You\u2019ll also slash and slay as Viola, a feisty witch in training who fights with a sword and a capricious companion, the demon Cheshire. Find out what fate awaits Bayonetta, and if this arcane alliance can really save reality!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 28, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "PlatinumGames", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonetta_3", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiUTp9tR8MY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166538-bayonetta-3\n"}
