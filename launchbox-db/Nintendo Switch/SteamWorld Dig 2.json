It is the fourth installment in the SteamWorld series of games and the direct sequel to 2013's SteamWorld Dig. Just like its predecessor, SteamWorld Dig 2 revolves around mining. The main character of the game is Dorothy, a steam-driven robot who also appeared in SteamWorld Dig as an ally. Like Rusty, the protagonist of SteamWorld Dig, Dorothy uses a pickaxe to create paths through an underground world by mining cubes of ground away. Besides mining resources and orbs, players will also fight enemy creatures that come on their path. Compared to its predecessor, SteamWorld Dig 2 features an increased focus on platform elements and a Metroidvania-style underground world. The game follows Dorothy in her search for Rusty after he disappeared in the end of the first game. The story connects the events from the original SteamWorld Dig and SteamWorld Heist.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 21, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Image & Form", "publishers": "Image & Form", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteamWorld_Dig_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh-hGfL28FY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90872-steamworld-dig-2\n"}
