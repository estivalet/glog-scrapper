Up to four hungry Kirbys must race, compete in minigames and battle it out across creamy, crunchy courses overflowing with chocolate, ice cream and other delicious delights. First, a race to claim a mountain of strawberries! The rules are simple: roll down the track and eat as many strawberries as you can. The more you gobble up, the more you\u2019ll grow and the faster you\u2019ll roll. Avoid flavoursome foes in your path or zip past them using tasty Copy Food abilities to keep up your Kirby\u2019s momentum! Next on the menu is a snack-sized minigame. Jump and bump into ravenous rivals while chomping down on the sweet strawberries falling in the arena. Hungry for more? Turn the tables on your opponents in another race before the next sugary stage. Then, prepare for the Battle Royale! Give your opponents their just desserts in this timed, tasty challenge. Knock them off the stage and scoff their strawberries while protecting your own stash! Don\u2019t worry \u2013 if you fall off, just float back for another fighting chance. Finally, it\u2019s time for a weigh in. The most well-rounded and heaviest Kirby wins!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 17, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Buffet", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOGQv0hJNJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164455-kirbys-dream-buffet\n"}
