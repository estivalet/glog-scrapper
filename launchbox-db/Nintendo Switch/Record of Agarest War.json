{"altername_name": [], "name": "Record of Agarest War", "overview": "The story progresses through various points plotted on a map. By visiting each point, the player has to battle the creatures, complete a quest, visit a town or go through a conversation to advance through the storyline and open up more points. Fighting plays out like a strategic RPG where each character has his/her own set of moves, but by moving each character to an appropriate square, you can chain characters together and pull off combos. After each round of combat, each character will regenerate AP and accumulate SP points. When enough SP points have been accumulated, characters can unleash special attacks. The game includes dating sim elements through its \"Soul Breed\" system in which the player creates a new character by pursuing a relationship with a female character as the game's storyline extends for five generations, each one having a different male protagonist. For the first four generations the protagonist marries one among three of his female companions and their son becomes the protagonist of the following generation who inherits stats and abilities from his parents.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "March 9, 2023", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Compile Heart", "publishers": "Aksys Games", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_Agarest_War", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367561-record-of-agarest-war\n"}
