{"altername_name": ["Doom Eternal"], "name": "DOOM Eternal", "overview": "Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer, an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of Hell, from a first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "December 8, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "id Software", "publishers": "Bethesda Softworks", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Eternal", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126821-doom-eternal\n"}
