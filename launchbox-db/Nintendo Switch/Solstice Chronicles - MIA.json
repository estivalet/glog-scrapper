{"altername_name": [], "name": "Solstice Chronicles: MIA", "overview": "In a dead colony on Mars a corporate marine is left far behind enemy lines. With the unlikely help of an insurgent drone, he faces a battle for survival against an army of murderous, mindless mutants... and worse things. This isometric action shooter includes key strategic decisions. Your drone has vital abilities and you need to strategize as you fight; should you scavenge for supplies or push forward to face the enemy? Decimate the mutant onslaught with upgradeable weaponry, including shotguns, rocket launchers and more, as well as special Heavy weapons like the autocannon and flamethrower, which will obliterate everything in their path. Develop your own skill tree from across four classes - Assault, Demolition, Hellfire, and Terminator - to become the ultimate instrument of destruction", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 7, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Ironward", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154592-solstice-chronicles-mia\n"}
