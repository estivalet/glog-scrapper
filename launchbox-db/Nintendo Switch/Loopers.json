While Tyler and his friends are out searching for a cache one day, they become caught in a time loop where the same day repeats itself without end. As they explore the loop, they meet a group of other people in the same predicament who call themselves \"loopers\". Together, the two groups try to escape the loop and return to normality. Loopers is a science fiction-themed kinetic novel, a type of visual novel without branching story paths or alternate endings.
