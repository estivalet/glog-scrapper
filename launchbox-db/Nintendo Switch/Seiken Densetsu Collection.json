{"altername_name": [], "name": "Seiken Densetsu Collection", "overview": "A Japan only release port (so far) of the first three Secret of Mana games (Final Fantasy Adventure (Game Boy), Secret of Mana (SNES), and Seiken Densetsu 3 (SFC, unlocalized)) for the Nintendo Switch. The collection includes for each game, a music test menu, scans of the original Japanese manuals plus a menu showing controls for the switch controller, options for quick saves and quick loads, changeable aspect ratios with each game having its own unique background, and portable gameplay! The only downside, is that the game can only be bought in Japan (for now...), and the language can't be changed from Japanese, which would make this text-based RPG hard to play through for players that can't understand the language. However, for those who are massive fans of the Secret of Mana series, and are looking to be able to play the games on the go (especially Seiken Densetsu 3), this game would be a welcome addition to all collectors of the series.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "June 1, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sqaure", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94629-seiken-densetsu-collection\n"}
