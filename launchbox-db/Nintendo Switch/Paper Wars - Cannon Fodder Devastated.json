With updated graphics built from the ground up in Unity and a brand-new chapter where we've exchanged soldiers for zombies, it\u2019s just better than ever! Prepare to face wave after wave of enemy soldiers and vehicles trying to cross the battlefield - don\u2019t let them!!! Get in your tank, take control of the cannon, and wipe them out. Collect power-ups to call in an airstrike, use a special triple-shot skill, or slow time, well, to slow time! Simple and effective. Just be careful not to blow up the power-ups. Friendly fire, soldier! Friendly fire!!! The game contains: \u2022 Three campaigns, each with 20 missions. \u2022 One brand-new campaign designed from scratch\u2026 \u2022 \u2026 with zombies in it!
