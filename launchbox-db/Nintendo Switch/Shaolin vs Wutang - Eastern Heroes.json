{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shaolin vs Wutang: Eastern Heroes", "overview": "Shaolin vs Wutang is a 1 on 1 INDIE CASUAL combat game featuring hand to hand and weapon combat, great music and inspired graphics. No flashy over the top effects, just combat influenced by classic Kung Fu films. The game features authentic fighting sounds from films and a licensed soundtrack with great music from classic kung fu movies. Shaolin vs Wutang is a real love letter to classic 70's and 80's Kung Fu cinema. This is an indie passion project that was made by one person who has tremendous passion for, and knowledge of Kung Fu films. It is not my intention to provide the same experience as big budget fighting games. But rather, I hope to provide players with a satisfying gaming experience blended with nostalgia and reminiscence of the great Kung Fu films. It is being released in early access so I can get valuable support and feedback in order to help the game reach its full potential. With the help of the community, we can create the ultimate Kung fu game!! Current Features Include: - Hand to hand and weapon combat - Dynamic blocking animations - Licensed Kung fu soundtrack featuring music from classic films - 30 Inspired Characters - 30 Stages - Unique moves and combos for every fighter - Single Player & Local Co-op", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 7, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jae-Lee Productions", "publishers": "GodSpeed Gaming Solutions", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155194-shaolin-vs-wutang-eastern-heroes\n"}
