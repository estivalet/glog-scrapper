{"altername_name": [], "name": "Axiom Verge", "overview": "Axiom Verge is a 2D metroidvania platform shooter centered around the protagonist Trace, a scientist who, after an experiment gone wrong, finds himself on the world of Sudra. By the time Trace arrives on Sudra he finds this world and his civilization collapsed due to the release of the \"Pathogen\". With help of the Russalki (giant war machines that guard Sudra), Trace has to fight back the invading forces and return back across The Breach to Earth. The world of Sudra is an open world in which Trace can travel back and forth, but needs access to better gear and weapons to keep progressing. Several areas can be travelled to by means of opening up pathways with the items Trace can find along the way. This also involves backtracking. Such items include for instance the Modified Labcoat, Grapple, Laser Drill, Address Disruptor and Remote Drone. Some weapons can be used to open secret paths. None of the available energy based weapons consume ammo. Upgrades for health and weapons can also be found while exploring every nook and cranny. Backtracking is needed for optionally completing the game entirely, but most of the weapons that are needed to finish the game can be found in a linear playthrough. The amount of alien flora and fauna on Sudra varies from area to area. The enemies respawn after leaving the general area. After killing them they leave behind some health.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 5, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Thomas Happ Games", "publishers": "Thomas Happ Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Verge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WMWOVN570k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93360-axiom-verge\n"}
