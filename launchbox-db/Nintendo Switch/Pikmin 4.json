{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pikmin 4", "overview": "Pikmin 4 is a real-time strategy video game developed by Nintendo EPD and Eighting and published by Nintendo. It is the fourth main installment of the Pikmin series, and sixth installment overall. The game marks the first in the series to feature a custom playable character, alongside other features involving a newly adjusted day and night system, allowing players to freely explore the area during the night without having to mandatorily retreat at the end of the day. In the game, the player assumes the role of a recently recruited member of the Rescue Corps, a group in need of rescuing following an unsuccessful attempt to save Captain Olimar. Pikmin 4 received positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's level design, visuals, score, amount of content, and accessibility to newcomers, while criticizing the limited multiplayer options and perceived lack of difficulty.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "July 21, 2023", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Eighting", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.52", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin_4", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/AYR3DVFUnyc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165521-pikmin-4\n"}
