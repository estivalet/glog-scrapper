{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sparkle 2", "overview": "Sparkle 2 is a the sequel to Sparkle, a puzzle game in the spirit of Zuma Deluxe. You fire orbs from the center of the screen into an incoming string of colored orbs. Match three orbs of the same color and they vanish from play. String a sequence of consecutive matches, and a power-up becomes available. Shoot the power-up and you activate it -- it might slow down or even send back the incoming string, eliminate a color from the board, etc. If the incoming orb string reaches a sink, you lose and must restart the level. As you clear levels, you unlock a variety of helpful items you can equip before each level. There are three game modes: Story, Survival and Challenge. The Story is a campaign with the quest to retrieve five magical keys. There are more than 90 levels.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 28, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "10tons", "publishers": "10tons", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118762-sparkle-2\n"}
