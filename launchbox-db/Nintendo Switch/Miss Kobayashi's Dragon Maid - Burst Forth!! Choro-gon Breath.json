Choro-gon Breath", "overview": "\"After receiving a cryptic email, Miss Kobayashi and her maids go to Takiya\u2019s house to investigate. There they are mysteriously (and overdramatically, let\u2019s face it) sucked into the PC. Help them clear stages by banding together and using their wits to defeat the computer. Using the 3-fold attack system of Long Range, Melee and the unique and deadly Choro-gon Breath (they\u2019re dragons, get it?), you\u2019ll obliterate the enemy! Combine the power of three with the Tag System by using Tohru, Kanna, and Elma to tackle each stage with Kobayashi\u2019s support. There\u2019s no enemy they can\u2019t defeat! In certain conditions, activate the dragons' Raging Spark to deal even deadlier damage! As you progress, collect 30 unique Memorial Pieces of the friends\u2019 precious daily life in beautiful illustrations created especially for the game!\"", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "March 24, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kaminari Games", "publishers": "bushiroad", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsKsExhjduM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164144-miss-kobayashis-dragon-maid-burst-forth-choro-gon-breath\n"}
