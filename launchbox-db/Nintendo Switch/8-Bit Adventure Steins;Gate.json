It is a retro adventure game in the style of classic Famicom/NES games of the 1980s, with downmixed chiptune versions of the music from the original Steins;Gate and the same characters, but a different plot, taking place on different worldlines. It was developed by 5pb. Games, and was released in September 2018 for Nintendo Switch. It is actually a Famicom/NES ROM that is run using a bundled Famicom/NES emulator. This 80s-style retro adventure game only comes with the Nintendo Switch version of Steins;Gate Elite and not with the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, or Windows PC versions of Steins;Gate Elite, which get an HD remastered version of Steins;Gate: Linear Bounded Phenogram instead of 8-bit ADV Steins;Gate. So far, this game is exclusively available on Nintendo Switch.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 19, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "5pb.", "publishers": "5pb.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/8-bit_ADV_Steins;Gate", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61ME4nGav64", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158709-8-bit-adventure-steinsgate\n"}
