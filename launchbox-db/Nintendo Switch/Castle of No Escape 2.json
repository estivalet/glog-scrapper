{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle of No Escape 2", "overview": "Prepare yourself for the dangers of the cursed castle! Explore 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 rooms of randomly generated hazards and enemies in a retro adventure! Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards - the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure. Although you are not alone - some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear... Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option, there are two difficulty modes: PAL or NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch. Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found\u2026 Features: \u2022 Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming \u2022 Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock \u2022 Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome \u2022 Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 22, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "D.E.X.
