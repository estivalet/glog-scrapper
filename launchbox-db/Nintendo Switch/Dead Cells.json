{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dead Cells", "overview": "Dead Cells is a roguelike-metroidvania video game developed and published by Motion Twin. Following about a year in early access, Dead Cells was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 7, 2018. In the game, the player takes the role of a body of cells that take control of a corpse in a dungeon, through which they must fight their way out. The player gains various weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the procedurally-generated levels to fight undead creatures within it. At times, the player may gain \"cells\", a type of in-game currency that can be used to purchase permanent upgrades for the player if they reach the vendor between each level. If they fail to reach this vendor before dying, they lose all the cells they gained and must start again. Motion Twin was inspired by The Binding of Isaac in developing the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 7, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Motion Twin", "publishers": "Motion Twin", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Cells", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112536-dead-cells\n"}
