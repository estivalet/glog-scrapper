Then embark on a journey in the new Galar region, where you\u2019ll challenge the troublemakers of Team Yell, while unraveling the mystery behind the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Zacian and Zamazenta! Explore the Wild Area, a vast expanse of land where the player can freely control the camera. Team up with three other players locally or online in the new multiplayer co-op Max Raid Battles* in which players will face off against gigantic and super-strong Pok\u00e9mon known as Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon. Certain Pok\u00e9mon can even Gigantamax to gain a new look and a powerful set of G-Max moves. But there\u2019s more to being a champion than honing your battle skills: you can pick your own clothes and get a new hairdo while visiting the stores in town, so you can be the Trainer you want to be. Throughout your journey, you\u2019ll encounter newly discovered Pok\u00e9mon as well as familiar ones that will look a little different in their new Galarian forms! And for another way to level up your Pok\u00e9mon, assign them Pok\u00e9 Jobs to complete. You can even play with your Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Camp, just for fun!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 15, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Game Freak", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sword_and_Shield", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlM-z2uC9fQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122521-pokemon-shield\n"}
