Embark on the adventure of an extraordinary family of heroes. With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe. It\u2019s a story about a valiant family standing together while the world around them is being devoured by darkness.
