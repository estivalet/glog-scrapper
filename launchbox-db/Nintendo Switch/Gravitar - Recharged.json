{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gravitar: Recharged", "overview": "A lone pilot, far from home, must navigate an abstract universe of uncharted planets and space stations guarded by mysterious, hostile aliens in Gravitar: Recharged. You must complete missions in each solar system, navigating a variety of challenging environments, each with varying levels of gravity that will test your skills as a pilot. Complete each mission within a solar system and you will be transported to the next through a massive black hole. Will you ever make it home? The visual aesthetic of Gravitar: Recharged takes the Recharged series in a new direction, with expansive environments rendered in painterly style and pastel tones. In the capable hands of industry-veteran composer Megan McDuffee, the original soundtrack complements the art style with soothing, atmospheric tracks that evoke a sense of wonder. Key Features: Arcade mode: fly from planet to planet and progress through ever-more-challenging solar systems in a quest to get home. Missions: 24 taxing challenges with global leaderboards. Power-Ups: Pick-up power-ups with your tractor beam, including homing missiles and EMP disruptors Co-op: Play with a partner in each game mode, which connects two players on a tether, requiring a significant level of coordination. Get in the Groove: Megan McDuffee continues to deliver with an ambient score that transports you into the depths of the unknown.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "June 2, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Adamvision Studios", "publishers": "Atari Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163187-gravitar-recharged\n"}
