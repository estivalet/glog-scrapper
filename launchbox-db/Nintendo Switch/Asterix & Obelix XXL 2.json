{"altername_name": ["Roman Rumble in Las Vegum: Asterix & Obelix XXL 2"], "name": "Asterix & Obelix XXL 2", "overview": "Asterix & Obelix XXL 2: Mission: Las Vegum is an action-adventure game for Windows and PlayStation 2, the sequel to Asterix & Obelix XXL. It was released in June 2006 in Europe. The game stars the French comic book characters Asterix and Obelix, and features spoofs to many classic games, in the same fashion that the comics spoof historical characters and make many cultural references. One such example of this is the box art that has a passing resemblance to the one seen in Grand Theft Auto III. A remake called Asterix & Obelix XXL 2: Mission: Wifix was released for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable in 2006.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 29, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "\u00c9tranges Libellules", "publishers": "Anuman Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix_%26_Obelix_XXL_2:_Mission:_Las_Vegum", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prk5F3Er-0I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112535-asterix-obelix-xxl-2\n"}
