{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mushroom Heroes", "overview": "Retro platformer where the player can switch between three different characters. You have a 3-mushroom hero, and each mushroom has special abilities, some of which the player needs in order to pass certain obstacles. Jumpi can jump higher and float in the air. Yuppi can kill enemies with his bow. The bow can also be used to detonate some walls and bombs. Dombi can block enemies' projectiles with his shield, and he can push or pull some objects. Mushroom Heroes brings back the look and feel of the very best classic platformers from the 90's, introducing refreshed and engaging gameplay mechanics. If you miss platformers from the 16-bit era, and think games nowadays aren't that good anymore, think twice!
