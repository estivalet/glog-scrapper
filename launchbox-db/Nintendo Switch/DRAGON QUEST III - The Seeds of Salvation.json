{"altername_name": [], "name": "DRAGON QUEST III: The Seeds of Salvation", "overview": "Dragon Quest III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II. Dragon Quest III adds a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier/Warrior, Fighter, Pilgrim/Cleric, Wizard/Mage, Merchant/Dealer, Goof-off/Jester, and Thief. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching level 20, a character may change classes at Alltrades Abbey. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. Dragon Quest III features a much larger world than its predecessors, as well as a much larger array of items, equipment, magic, and enemies. It was intended to have even more features, including a small medal system, but these additional features were cut from the original release to save space.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 27, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Armor Project", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_III", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrfy1hq4mdE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122565-dragon-quest-iii-the-seeds-of-salvation\n"}
