But be warned: curiosity killed the cat... Inspector Waffles was hoping his worst days were behind him, but the murder of a high-profile industrialist CEO beloved by the citizens of Cat Town raises new questions and fears. Being the best inspector on the CTPD, Waffles has no choice: he's gotta push past the painful memories, don his well-worn overcoat, and prepare to get his paws dirty. A detective story reminiscent of the old school classics, Inspector Waffles provides plenty of peculiar mystery, a story full of intrigue, and a slew of characters to interrogate, all wrapped into beautifully simple pixel-art. Will you be able to sniff out every clue and nab the murderer? A REAL TREAT, SEE? * A brilliant feline detective in a world full of anthropomorphic cats, dogs, and maybe other species. It\u2019s pixel-animal madness, I tell ya. * A beautiful jazzy soundtrack, full of notes and music and harmony pleasing to your ears and brain. * Chock full of dry humor and puns about cats and dogs. Seriously, I couldn\u2019t think of any more puns to include. The pun supply is exhausted.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 14, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Goloso Games", "publishers": "Hitcents", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_ZkMhunJQ8&t=19s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156366-inspector-waffles\n"}
