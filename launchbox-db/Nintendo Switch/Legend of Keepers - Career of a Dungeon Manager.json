Features Join the Dungeons Company and climb the corporate ladder Crush so-called \"heroes\" and protect the company's treasures Hire monsters, manage your employees and your stock of traps Deal with employee strikes and other fun events RogueDefender Each run will be different but players will keep some of their Master's bonuses between runs. Like we've already mentioned, our game is a mix between Roguelite and Dungeon Management. How did we achieve that? By running many tests to find the perfect balance between management and dungeon phases! Dungeon Phase First, you will have to plan your defense against a group of adventurers. Check their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin! You will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler: heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you placed. When a group of adventurers encounters a group of monsters you positioned in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 29, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Goblinz Studio", "publishers": "Goblinz Studio", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155922-legend-of-keepers-career-of-a-dungeon-manager\n"}
