Experience Makai Kingdom: Reclaimed and Rebound (now with new content, dood!) and Z.H.P.: Unlosing Ranger vs. Darkdeath Evilman on a modern platform for the first time in over 10 years, with English and Japanese audio! Makai Kingdom: Reclaimed and Rebound: Makai Kingdom is the story of Overlord Zetta, who accidentally destroys his own Netherworld. In order to save himself, he seals his soul inside a book. Reduced to nothing more than a tome, Zetta is forced to enlist the help of his fellow Overlords to get his netherworld (and his body) back. Z.H.P.: Unlosing Ranger vs. Darkdeath Evilman: The Unlosing Ranger is on his way to save Japan from Darkdeath Evilman when disaster strikes and he is struck by a car! With his dying breath he bequeaths his morphing belt to the true hero of the story: the most average boy in the universe. Will he rise to the challenge?", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "May 10, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "publishers": "NIS America", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53mBt24s08Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370782-prinny-presents-nis-classics-volume-2-makai-kingdom-reclaimed-and-rebound-zhp-unlosing-ranger-vs-darkdeath-evilman\n"}
