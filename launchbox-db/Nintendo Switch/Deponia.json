{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deponia", "overview": "The world of Deponia is a grim one: the people's home is a huge garbage dump. In the clouds flies the city Elysium, which is considered the only place where one can escape those harsh living conditions. But of course there is no way up \u2014 however, the egocentric inventor Rufus, the hero of the game, tries all he can to get there... This is a traditional point & click adventure in which the player needs to solve puzzle chains in order to achieve the chapter's big goal. The puzzles range from inventory puzzles (combining found items in the inventory with each other or with items in the game world), dialogue puzzles and logic puzzles like setting railway switches. The latter are isolated from the regular game environment and can be mostly skipped. Of course the game also offers the usual hot spot help which shows all interactive items on the screen. Besides the puzzle solving, one of the most important aspects of the game are the characters and their development over the course of the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 24, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Daedalic Entertainment", "publishers": "Daedalic Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deponia_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRQhKw-YCWs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154638-deponia\n"}
