This title brought the Tales series a new battle system in 3D, in which the player-controlled character moves on a 2D plane, except when physically attacking an enemy located off the plane. The story takes place in Sylvarant, a world in danger of extinction due to the exploitation of mana by an evil group thought to be sealed away by the hero Mithos 4,000 years ago. Colette, The Chosen One, receives an oracle from the heavenly institution Cruxis, and sets out on a World Regeneration journey with her childhood friend Lloyd.
