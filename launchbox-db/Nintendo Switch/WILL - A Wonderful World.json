{"altername_name": [], "name": "WILL: A Wonderful World", "overview": "There was an urban legend. Write your troubles down on a note. Hold it in your hand at midnight and pray. \u201cGod, please help me\u2026\u201d Then God will hear your plea and change your fate. A young girl wakes up, groggy and in an unknown room. A talking dog appears before her and she becomes startled by his revelation: They are gods and it is their duty to change the fate of any humans that ask for their help. Letters appear in the mail and with pen in hand she begins her job. Dive deep into the story and learn about those that seek out your help but, remember, changing someone\u2019s fate will affect others. Experience each story, edit letters and solve puzzles; perhaps the young girl\u2019s memory will return, but what will she learn about herself and her mission?", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 17, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "WMY Studio", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122582-will-a-wonderful-world\n"}
