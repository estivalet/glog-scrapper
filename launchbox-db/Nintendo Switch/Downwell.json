{"altername_name": [], "name": "Downwell", "overview": "Downwell is a curious game about a young person venturing down a well in search of untold treasures with only his Gunboots for protection. Make your way further and further down into the darkness filled with nasty creatures and mysterious secrets to collect the spectacular red gems scattered about the rocks. Step into precariously placed shops and buy some helpful items or level up between levels to battle well-dwelling monsters and uncover hidden caves filled with riches and relics. No two trips down the well are ever the same!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "January 31, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Moppin", "publishers": "Devolver Digital", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downwell_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT_YHKL77hA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112938-downwell\n"}
