{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Quest", "overview": "Dragon Quest is one of the first console RPGs (role-playing games). The player controls a single character who is able to travel from town to town exploring on his quest. He can equip various weapons and armor and battles enemy monsters in one-on-one combat. As more enemies are defeated, the hero becomes stronger and able to explore greater distances as he completes his quest. Ultimately, the hero must defeat an evil boss marking the end of his adventure. This game formula was replicated in most, if not all, console RPGs.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 27, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Armor Project", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXJ0uldAgO8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122563-dragon-quest\n"}
