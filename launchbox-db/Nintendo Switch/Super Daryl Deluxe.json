{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Daryl Deluxe", "overview": "Experience high school again in Super Daryl Deluxe, the last totally normal high school-themed RPGvania you'll ever want. Super Daryl Deluxe is an RPGvania with brawler-style combat set inside of a perfectly normal, sprawling, multi-dimensional high school. Like any other perfectly normal school, its students and faculty are going missing and the classrooms have been locked down for weeks. Yes, there's nothing remarkable happening at WFHS whatsoever - just ask the new principal. Things are bound to get stirred up when an enthusiastic, bizarrely dressed new kid wanders into town. This go-getter's name is Daryl, and he just wants to make friends. What starts out as an innocent effort to help jump-start a young contraband textbook business turns into a harrowing quest through the school and its enormous, monster-filled classrooms in the hope of becoming the most popular kid in town. Oh - and saving everyone's lives is top priority, of course. No need to worry. There's nothing to see here at Water Falls High School.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 10, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Dan & Gary Games", "publishers": "Dan & Gary Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155738-super-daryl-deluxe\n"}
