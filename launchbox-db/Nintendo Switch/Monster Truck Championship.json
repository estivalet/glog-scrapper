{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monster Truck Championship", "overview": "A true Monster Truck simulation! From Las Vegas to Orlando, go head-to-head against experienced drivers in drag races and freestyle competitions! But before you can pull off doughnuts, wheelies and bicycles, you must first tune your truck to perfection. These machines are colossal and spectacular yet highly technical to drive.

But what's performance without style?
