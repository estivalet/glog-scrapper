{"altername_name": [], "name": "N++ (NPLUSPLUS)", "overview": "This is the long-awaited sequel to the legendary N+, rewritten from scratch to be bigger, better, and more beautiful in every way. N++ is a fast-paced, momentum-based platformer about darting around obstacles, narrowly evading enemies and collecting gold in a beautiful minimalist landscape. N++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there\u2019s a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from completing your goal. Through the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels, you\u2019ll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your fluid movement, you need to \u2018solve\u2019 each level and get to the exit.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "May 24, 2018", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Metanet Software", "publishers": "Metanet Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113062-n-nplusplus\n"}
