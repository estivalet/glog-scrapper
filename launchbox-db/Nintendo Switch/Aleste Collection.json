{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aleste Collection", "overview": "Aleste Collection is a compilation of the 8-bit Sega games in Compile's Aleste series of 2D shooters. Like with M2's other collections, its main focus is on authenticity and high-quality emulation. Each game has also been enhanced with a number of new features. M2's signature \"gadgets\" give players new UI elements on the sides of the screen to visualize different aspects of gameplay like the status of players' weapons and powerups. A new challenge mode lets players try short-term challenges based on individual segments of levels in each game in the collection. Aside from the older games, the headlining feature is the brand-new game GG Aleste 3 - an original sequel developed for the actual Game Gear hardware. It follows Lluna Wizn, pilot candidate from the Earth Orbital Army Lunar Defense Corps, who's scrambled into service following a terrorist attack on the \"MOON CHILD\" base that leaves her as the only survivor. With gameplay inspired by GG Aleste II, it caps off the 8-bit Aleste series.
