{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Fox Awaits Me", "overview": "When I came to, I was in a bamboo grove. I was in a stupor, so I didn't know where I was, and I couldn't remember who I was. There was one bell on a bamboo branch that was ringing as it swayed in the wind. While still charmed by it, I took this somewhat strange bell and hung it from my neck. \"home.\" I started to walk through the bamboo grove. That's when the wind suddenly fluttered around me, and when I looked back at that moment, I saw a small, pale hand. \"Master... is that you...?\" A single fox girl was standing there. She was crying and looked very happy. The fox girl Shua yearns for the main character Kaito while they live in the forest near a pond, the Mountain Deity Mim interferes with Kaito and Shua, and the Grim Reaper Karin accidentally almost kills Kaito. Once they meet, the sad fate of the fox and the boy springs into action again. Can Kaito who lost his memories oppose that fate? \"The Fox Awaits Me\" is a visual novel with multiple choices and endings that features stunning Live2D animation, and swings between sadness, high-energy comedy, and nail-biting fear.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 16, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Cosen", "publishers": "Cosen", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157052-the-fox-awaits-me\n"}
