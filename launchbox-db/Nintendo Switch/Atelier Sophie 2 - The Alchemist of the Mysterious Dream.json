{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream", "overview": "A mysterious story of a mysterious dream\u2026 This is a role-playing story about one of the adventures Sophie the Alchemist had after she left her hometown of Kirchen Bell. It is centered on Sophie's quest of searching for Plachta after they are separated in a dream world of Erde Wiege, and the new friends they meet there. Main features: Evolved Seamless Turn-Based Battles: This game incorporates new multi-link turn battles that feature six party members divided in two teams and begin seamlessly when players encounter enemies while exploring. The combat experience is enriched by a multitude of special effects and actions, including special Dual Trigger skills that involve two of the team members attacking in unison. Two Types of the Panel-Based Synthesis: This game features an accessible puzzle-like synthesis system where you place ingredients on a panel to create new items. Players can choose to use either the Standard Panel or the Restricted Panel, which will increase both the difficulty level and the rewards. Manipulate the Weather to Open New Paths: While each region of Erde Wiege has fixed weather, you will be able to change this with the help of special tools. Changing the weather will allow you to not only change the scenery when visiting the same area but also gain access to new, previously inaccessible places. Perhaps the weather will affect even the materials you can collect? Note: Costumes can be changed in the \"Changing Room\" at the desk in the atelier.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 25, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Gust", "publishers": "Koei Tecmo", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier_Sophie_2:_The_Alchemist_of_the_Mysterious_Dream", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/8qPh2QbRQVY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160789-atelier-sophie-2-the-alchemist-of-the-mysterious-dream\n"}
