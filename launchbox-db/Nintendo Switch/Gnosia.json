The crew of a drifting spaceship, facing off against a mysterious and deadly threat known as the \u201cGnosia\u201d and having no idea who among them is really the enemy, formulate a desperate plan for survival. The most suspicious among them will be put into \u201ccold sleep\u201d one by one, in an effort to rid the ship of Gnosia. Gnosia is a Sci-Fi Social Deduction RPG in which you will engage in discussion with a variety of unique characters, with the aim of identifying the Gnosia among the group. Players will have to use what information they can gather during the discussions to ascertain whom they think is Gnosia and then vote to put them into cold sleep. As you progress, your abilities will improve - but so will those of the crew. As the numbers of crew members, Gnosia, and various \u201croles\u201d increase, it will become increasingly difficult to determine who is telling the truth. Work in collaboration with or against other crew members to ensure your survival until the end.
