{"altername_name": [], "name": "Breakout: Recharged", "overview": "The grandfather of brick-breaking games is back with some of the toughest challenges yet! Breakout: Recharged steps up the excitement with a fresh coat of paint, exciting power-ups, and another original soundtrack from award-winning video game composer Megan McDuffee. Breakout: Recharged will forever change what you expect from a brick-breaking title. The endless arcade mode and 50 challenge levels will push you to the limit of your skills. Don\u2019t fret, however, as this wouldn\u2019t be a Recharged title without game-changing powerups. Expect the aid of rail guns, homing missiles, and explosives to join the traditional multi-ball. You\u2019ll need every tool in the arsenal and razor-sharp reflexes to climb the global leaderboards.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 10, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Adamvision Studios", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/breakout-recharged-switch/", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuUe_BcHOYU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158945-breakout-recharged\n"}
