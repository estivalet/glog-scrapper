You kill with one shot and you never miss. When you run out of ammo you just throw a gun away. You can disarm any enemy and use any weapon; when it's time to get out you just use a vehicle nearby. You have an apartment in the historical center of the city. When you want to eat you go to a cafe, and you can visit a museum or a cinema when you're looking for entertainment. And you have a lover when that need arises. Around the intense action there is the mundane, as you seek to pass your days. All along there is an important question that\u2019s longing for an answer. Features: \u25cf Stylish and mood-setting pixel-based visuals. \u25cf Fast gunplay action as you take down waves of enemies. \u25cf Explore in quiet moments; go to the cinema, caf\u00e9, museum, meet a lover or stay at home alone.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "May 21, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "yeo", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfJQYmQGqOU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161914-arrest-of-a-stone-buddha\n"}
