{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turok 2: Seeds of Evil", "overview": "The Dinosaur Hunter Returns Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately the blast awakens an even deadlier force - The Primagen. Once again a Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. Fight your way through 35 different types of enemies with bouncing bellies, blinking eyes, stretching tentacles and snapping jaws. From Prehistoric Raptors, to evolved Flesh Eaters, to your final battle with the Mother of all beasts - you\u2019ll want to defeat all of them! Enemies are intelligent! They\u2019re smart enough to attack in groups, to flee when they are outgunned, and to take cover during a firefight. Enemies flinch and spasm differently depending on which body part you hit. Conquer 6 engrossing Quest Levels including the Port of Adia, the Death Marshes and the Lair of the Blind Ones.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 9, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Iguana Entertainment", "publishers": "Limited Run Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turok_2:_Seeds_of_Evil#Remaster", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Q8bIawMNE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118850-turok-2-seeds-of-evil\n"}
