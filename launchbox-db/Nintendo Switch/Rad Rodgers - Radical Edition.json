{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rad Rodgers: Radical Edition", "overview": "Rad is a rambunctious but spirited young boy who maybe plays too many video games. After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure. Dusty is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude! Rad & Dusty's adventure takes them through many dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 26, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Slipgate Studios", "publishers": "HandyGames", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2F7x6jjGSc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113402-rad-rodgers-radical-edition\n"}
