{"altername_name": [], "name": "12 orbits", "overview": "12 orbits doesn\u2019t require any prior knowledge, preparation time or additional controllers. Your left and right Joy-Con, or even the touch screen alone, are all you need for any number of players. The only limit is how close you\u2019d like to be together. 12 orbits is colorful, friendly, fun, and sometimes a little chaotic. You will score goals, color spheres, defend your territory and try to grow as long as possible in 4 varied game modes. It\u2019s you against all comers, or grouped as teams. With simple rules and only one button per player, 12 orbits can be taught to anyone in no time. You can set up a new game in a matter of seconds, even for 12 players. And since each round only lasts about 5 minutes, there\u2019s always time for another quick match!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 27, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "12", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150206-12-orbits\n"}
