{"altername_name": [], "name": "ACA NEOGEO THE ULTIMATE 11 SNK FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP", "overview": "The Ultimate 11 is the fourth game in the Super Sidekicks series. Regional tournaments are replaced with the SNK Football Championship, which is an elimination tournament in which the player's team can select any team from any region to play against. The final team played against in this tournament is the SNK Superstars, which consists of characters from SNK's fighting games. A new addition is the charge bar. It's charged depending on how long a team has the ball, and when full, it can be used when near a goal to make a near-unblockable shot. The \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores*. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 28, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "Hamster", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/8VcasLsmx1Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150133-aca-neogeo-the-ultimate-11-snk-football-championship\n"}
