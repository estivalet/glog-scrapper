And from these stones, ghosts start apperaring successively, turning the peaceful life of the villagers into a nightmare. Suddenly, in the forest, a swordsman's blade shines in the night! It is the katana of a ninja apprentice, Kagemaru. \"Why won't the warriors come and help the villagers...\" Kagemaru already knew the answer, as the city and its castle were flooded with ghosts summoned by this evil power.
