{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wartile: Complete Edition", "overview": "Wartile is a cool-down based strategy game in which you control a warband of Viking figurines in a miniature universe inspired by Norse mythology. Experience a living, breathing tabletop video game that invites the player into a miniature universe full of small adventures set in beautifully handcrafted diorama battle boards inspired by Norse mythology to honor the Vikings! This version includes the Complete Edition where all previous DLCs have been included right away. Wartile is a cool-down based game that keeps the action flowing, with ample opportunities to plan your moves. Although it contains the strategic elements from turn-based games, a mixture of slow down features and cool-down based gameplay maintains the tension of battle while allowing for breathing room to make tactical decisions. At its heart, Wartile is a game about positioning and tactical decision making. With Slow Time always available you can control the speed of the fight giving you an advantageous tactical benefit in critical situations where every action counts. Collect and level up an array of different figurines. Customize your Warband with armor pieces, weapons, unique combat abilities and set up your deck of Battle Cards, to provide a choice of tactical options before they embark on each quest.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 22, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Playwood Project", "publishers": "Deck 13", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156131-wartile-complete-edition\n"}
