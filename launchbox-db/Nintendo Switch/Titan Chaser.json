{"altername_name": [], "name": "Titan Chaser", "overview": "Titan Chaser is a surreal driving and walking experience, where your job is to scout giant creatures and use the light to drive them off without fighting or killing. Every night you leave the motel and drive through empty fields, looking for something. Your job is to scout wandering giants and drive them away from the sleeping town using light. It's a meditative experience where you don't need to manage fuel, car maintenance, health, or damage. Just find where to drive and how to use your tools effectively. Or just forget about your work and drive through foggy landscapes to calm down after a hard day.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 15, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Samustai", "publishers": "shostak.games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156895-titan-chaser\n"}
