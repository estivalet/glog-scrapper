{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aircraft Evolution", "overview": "Aircraft Evolution is an action game, where you have the task of destroying enemy bases by bombarding them with your aircraft. Fight through 4 time periods, from the era of the First World War to futuristic battles. Level up and evolve your aircraft from a wooden plane to a futuristic fighter. Then, refine it by increasing its armor, fuel, speed, firepower and much more. You upgrade as you go, but you can still try to take on a tank armed with plasma cannons using just a wooden plane! 40 different missions are waiting for you. You will be given different objectives: destroy an enemy base, deal with waves of attacking fighters, boss fights and much more. Demolish the enemy with standard bombs, a barrage of cluster bombs, or burn enemies to ashes with napalm. Turn their bases into smoldering ruins and the battlefield into a scorched desert. Bombs and explosions! More bombs and explosions!!!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "July 22, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Sometimes You", "publishers": "Sometimes You", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/u3EoouJRd78", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135355-aircraft-evolution\n"}
