{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kill the Bad Guy", "overview": "Does everyone deserve a second chance? Can crimes ever be forgotten? Hiding behind the mask of the average man on the street, and furtively blending into the background, many war criminals, ex-Mafia members and other criminals have been literally getting away with murder, or worse. That is, until you turned up to ruin the party. As part of a secret and mysterious society whose members have sworn to rid the world of these Bad Guys, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure justice is served in the bloodiest possible way, using your unpredictability to your advantage. Track the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one. But bear this in mind: each criminal\u2019s death has to look like an accident. In each level, you\u2019ll have the chance to splatter and destroy the Bad Guy using various weapons and traps. It\u2019s up to you to make sure he ends up in the wrong place at the right time. In this ingenious puzzle game in which physics plays an essential role, you\u2019ll need to keep a cool head and your wits about you. Show no mercy as you set out to kill the Bad Guy! \u201cUntil your mission is accomplished we don\u2019t exist. If you fail, you\u2019ll be the only person at fault, and we\u2019ll deny ever knowing you.\u201d Features TRACK YOUR TARGET in 60 levels, each one more original than the last, and unlock 6 completely off-the-wall bonus levels.
