A great plague, wrought by human hands, devoured all known life and puked forth a new and foreign kind of creature: the mutants. The evils that escaped this Pandora\u2019s box, still loyal to the alien genes within their flesh, could not be controlled by humans. Our extinction is upon us! Dr. Hartmuth Griesgram, a heartbroken and eccentric scientist who is responsible for the creation of synthetic humans, activates his accursed human manufactory one last time to unleash his ultimate creation and his final hope: the prototype SturmFront battle unit. A flawless cyborg engineered for war. You play as Siegfried von Hammerstein, a unique semi-organic battle unit whose only purpose to exist is to kill and destroy.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 2, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Andrade Games", "publishers": "Red Art Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151309-sturmfront-the-mutant-war-ubel-edition\n"}
