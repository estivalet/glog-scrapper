{"altername_name": [], "name": "Touhou Spell Bubble", "overview": "Touhou Spell Bubble is a chaotic mashup of Taito's classic action puzzle game Puzzle Bobble and the T\u014dh\u014d (Touhou) series. At its core, it keeps Puzzle Bobble's core gameplay; the top of the screen is filled with bubbles of various colours, and players shoot coloured balls from their cannon at the bottom of the screen in order to create combos and clear the screen. Layered on top of this is a rhythm game element, with players rewarded for shooting bubbles to the beat of the music. It features 20 fully voiced playable characters from across the T\u014dh\u014d series along with a large variety of arrangements of classic T\u014dh\u014d songs, with arrangements by both Taito's in-house sound team and guest musicians.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 29, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Spell_Bubble", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTmpT3zyv7E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153245-touhou-spell-bubble\n"}
