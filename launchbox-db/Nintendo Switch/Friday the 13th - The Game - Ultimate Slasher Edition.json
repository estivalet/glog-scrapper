Jason is equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods and he knows them all too well.

Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape, while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night but every choice has a consequence. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike! Play as the Counselors! Each counselor trope will have their strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 13, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Black Tower Studios", "publishers": "Gun Media", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_The_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7kHvmim6i0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134547-friday-the-13th-the-game-ultimate-slasher-edition\n"}
