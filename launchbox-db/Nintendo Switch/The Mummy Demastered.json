As an elite agent in the monster-hunting Prodigium organization, you must use a variety of weapons, upgrades, and magical artifacts to defend mankind against the supernatural hordes of Princess Ahmanet. Your Prodigium teammates are already on the scene, but HQ lost contact with them hours ago; only by exploring tombs, forests, abandoned tunnels, and the cursed streets of London will you discover the fate of your allies. But beware - Ahmanet commands legions of zombies, insects, plague-ridden vermin, and worse... and if you're not careful, you'll be the next soul in Ahmanet's thrall.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 24, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "WayForward Technologies", "publishers": "Limited Run Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mummy_Demastered", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113045-the-mummy-demastered\n"}
