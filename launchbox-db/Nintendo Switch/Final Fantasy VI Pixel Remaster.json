{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster", "overview": "FINAL FANTASY VI is a game that\u2019s beloved by fans and critics alike. That\u2019s partly thanks to its incredible setting and story. It\u2019s set in a land where magic has disappeared, and humanity has instead turned to iron, gunpowder, steam and other technology. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that magic is mostly gone - a young woman enslaved by the evil Empire still has the power. When she encounters a powerful ancient being called an Esper, she sets off a chain of events that will have epic and terrible consequences.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 19, 2023", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368149-final-fantasy-vi-pixel-remaster\n"}
