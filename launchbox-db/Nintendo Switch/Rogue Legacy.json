{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rogue Legacy", "overview": "Rogue Legacy is a genealogical rogue-\"LITE\" where anyone can be a hero. Each time you die, your child will succeed you. Every child is unique. One child might be colorblind, another might have vertigo-- they could even be a dwarf. That's OK, because no one is perfect, and you don't have to be perfect to succeed. But you do have to be pretty darn good because this game is HARD. Fortunately, every time you die all the gold you've collected can be used to upgrade you manor, giving your next child a step up in life and another chance at vanquishing evil.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 6, 2018", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Cellar Door Games", "publishers": "Cellar Door Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_Legacy", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113099-rogue-legacy\n"}
