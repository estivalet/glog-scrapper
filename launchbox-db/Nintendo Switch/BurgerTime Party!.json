Make massive burgers while avoiding edible enemies across over 100 stages stuffed with platforming puzzles and arcade action. Dining solo?

If you're looking for a cooperative challenge, then we invite you to join forces with up to three friends and form the ultimate munch squad! But if you'd rather battle it out for control of the kitchen, choose to play as a pepper-slinging Chef or a menacing Food Foe in Battle Burger mode for 2-4 players!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 8, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "G-Mode", "publishers": "Xseed Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF_EYFSgP3s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122977-burgertime-party\n"}
