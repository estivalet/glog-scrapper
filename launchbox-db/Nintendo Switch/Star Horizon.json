You assume the role of John, a simple private space-pilot in the service of the Federation. Well.. the word \u201cpilot\u201d might be an overstatement. John\u2019s ship AI \u2013 which he calls \u201cEllie\u201d - takes almost all control of the ship. The space battles are coordinated by Motherships and \u201cpilots\u201d serve the mere role of the shooters (as the AI can\u2019t \u2018kill\u2019). Inter Galactic Corporation is about to turn the tide of the war but an accident happens. Your Mothership is blown up into pieces which makes Ellie go crazy.

Will the two - John and Ellie - change the fate of the Universe?", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "May 14, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Tabasco Interactive", "publishers": "No Gravity Games", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130437-star-horizon\n"}
