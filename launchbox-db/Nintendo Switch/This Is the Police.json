The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage. Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you\u2019ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg\u2019s crime bosses.
