{"altername_name": ["Super Dancing Made in Wario"], "name": "WarioWare: Move It!", "overview": "WarioWare: Move It! is an party video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the eleventh installment in the WarioWare series, the second WarioWare game to be released on the Nintendo Switch, and the first direct sequel in the WarioWare series, being a follow-up to the 2006 Wii game, WarioWare: Smooth Moves. Like previous entries in the WarioWare series, the game tasks players with tackling waves of fast-paced minigames known as \"microgames.\" Similar to Smooth Moves, which used the system's Wii Remote controller for motion-controlled microgames, the game focuses on using the motion controls of the Switch's Joy-Con controllers. Each microgame centers around one of several \"forms\" depicting how the player should initially hold the Joy-Cons, after which players move the controllers accordingly to complete each microgame. In addition to motion controls, some microgames also utilize the infrared camera on the right Joy-Con. Move It! includes over 200 microgames. The game features local co-op play, where two players must sync their motions with one another to complete microgames, and additional modes for up to four players.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 3, 2023", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Move_It!", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373998-warioware-move-it\n"}
