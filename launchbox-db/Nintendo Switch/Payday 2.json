{"altername_name": [], "name": "Payday 2", "overview": "The game consists of a variety of 'heists' that a player can opt to either carry out by themselves, with the AI, or as part of a multiplayer game. There are heists such as bank robberies, drug trafficking runs, rigging an election, or stealing smuggled nuclear warheads. Some of the heists put a large emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and money on completion. The level selection menu is styled as a fictional website, Crime.net, where missions pop up periodically as contracts in a map of Washington D.C. The player can pick up an open contract, join a contract another player has started, or buy a contract with in-game money in an offshore bank account. There are seven difficulty levels, with increased money and experience payouts for higher difficulty levels. Independent of difficulty was the \"pro job\" condition - pro jobs give additional experience, but cannot be retried if the players fail, later removed in an update. Some contracts in Payday 2 take place over multiple days, with each day represented by a separate level with different objectives. After certain days of heists are completed in 'loud' (In which the alarm has sounded) the game may add an escape level, where the players' original escape is thwarted and they must survive to reach their backup getaway", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 27, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Overkill Software", "publishers": "Starbreeze Publishing AB\u202c", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payday_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113017-payday-2\n"}
