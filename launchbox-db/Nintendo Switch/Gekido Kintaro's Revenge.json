{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gekido Kintaro's Revenge", "overview": "A year has passed since the epic battle that decided the fate of mankind and claimed the life of beloved Angela... Dark omens once again tell of the return of an evil presence. Ushi is the last remaining master of the ancient art of Shin-Ken, and he calls upon Tetsuo, his disciple and adopted son, to investigate some strange happenings in a faraway farming village outside the city. Features: Players can enjoy exciting extra modes: 'Survival' and the intriguing 'Relic Hunt,' which has a rogue-like twist. This game distinguishes itself from traditional brawlers, as it requires more than simply moving from left to right while defeating enemies to progress. Players must explore caves and houses, traverse ladders, and engage in platforming as they search for essential items like keys to unlock doors, or lanterns to illuminate dark caves.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "March 22, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "NAPS Team", "publishers": "NAPS Team", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekido_Advance:_Kintaro%27s_Revenge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT_ZnNl97Hs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371167-gekido-kintaros-revenge\n"}
