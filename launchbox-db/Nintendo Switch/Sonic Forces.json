Modern Sonic plays through three-dimensional stages like those seen in Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors, while Classic Sonic's gameplay features 2D side-scrolling stages reminiscent of the early Sonic games for Sega Genesis. Modern Sonic can perform homing attacks and boost by collecting White Wisps, while Classic Sonic, in addition to his Spin Dash ability, can perform the Drop Dash introduced in Sonic Mania.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 7, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.37", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Forces", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vFmCA1dF-g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91343-sonic-forces\n"}
