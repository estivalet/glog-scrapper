{"altername_name": ["DOOM (2016)"], "name": "DOOM", "overview": "Doom is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. A reboot of the Doom franchise, it is the fourth title in the main series and the first major installment since Doom 3 in 2004. Players take the role of an unnamed marine as he battles demonic forces from Hell that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation on a future-set colonized planet Mars. The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games than the slower survival horror approach of Doom 3. It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions known as \"glory kills\".", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 10, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "id Software", "publishers": "Bethesda Softworks", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "12", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(2016_video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=6lRpoGucGA0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87293-doom\n"}
