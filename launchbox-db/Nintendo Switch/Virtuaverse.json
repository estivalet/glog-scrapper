{"altername_name": [], "name": "Virtuaverse", "overview": "VirtuaVerse is set at an indeterminate point in the future in a cyberpunk dystopia. Advanced technologies, such as cybernetic enhancements, hovercars, and sex robots are commonplace; however, society has also become hyper-commercialized, and consumer demand for these resource-intensive technological innovations has brought planet Earth to the brink of ecological collapse. Among hackers and those operating outside the law, older \"retro\" technologies like telephone modems and magnetic hard drives are prized because while the abandoned infrastructure to support this obsolete tech still exists, they are effectively \"off the grid\" and cannot be easily tracked, making them ideal tools for smuggling and piracy.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 18, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Theta Division", "publishers": "Blood Music", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtuaVerse", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BJ8zokyzac", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368160-virtuaverse\n"}
