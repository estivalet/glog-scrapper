A player can choose out of 73 national teams. The game is based on Super Sidekicks 3: The Next Glory, and reuses animation from this game. Gameplay is typical for the genre - the player controls all footballers in the team, and must win matches with rivals. Three buttons are used for shot+low pass/sliding, high pass/tackle and short pass/player change.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 29, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "Hamster", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/bHfifyJCDPQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156939-aca-neogeo-neo-geo-cup-98-the-road-to-the-victory\n"}
