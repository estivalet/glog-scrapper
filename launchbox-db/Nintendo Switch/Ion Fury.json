{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ion Fury", "overview": "Shelly \u201cBombshell\u201d Harrison takes on a quest to slay evil transhumanist mastermind Dr. Jadus Heskel in the streets of Neo DC. She leaves a trail of carnage throughout huge, multi-path levels filled with gigantic explosions, more secret areas than we can count, and inhuman foes behind every corner. There\u2019s no regenerating health here; stop taking cover and start running and gunning. Shelly\u2019s crusade to take down Heskel\u2019s army will see her leave destruction in her wake with a wide arsenal of weapons, complete with alternate fire modes and different ammo types.
