Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty. Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "March 5, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sting", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141416-yggdra-union-well-never-fight-alone\n"}
