Rearrange the panels of an animated comic book to craft the story of a noir-styled spy adventure.

The FRAMED Collection for Switch includes a completely updated UI, but retains the intuitive tactile controls of FRAMED and FRAMED 2. Perfectly suited for the portable play that the Switch is renowned for, the puzzle format of the FRAMED Collection can turn a quick train trip into a pleasurable escape, or a night away on holiday into an adventure.
