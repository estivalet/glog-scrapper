From the BAFTA-Award winning studio behind Monument Valley and Assemble with Care comes something entirely new! Join Alba as she visits her grandparents on a Mediterranean island. She is ready for a peaceful summer of wildlife exploration with her friend Ines, but when she sees an animal in danger, she realizes she needs to do something about it! This is truly a Mediterranean paradise if you ignore all the litter! From the idyllic beaches to the ancient castle overlooking the town. A whole island is ready to be explored. With Ines and your grandfather - who is a total bird nerd - by your side, you can start the movement to save the island. Maybe even the world after that. What you can expect: '- Great music. We worked with Lorena Alvarez, to make a soundtrack that is equal parts Spain and Amazing - This is a Chillectathon. Make your time on the island your own and experience the adventure at your own pace. No rush - A place you want to stay. We based this on our childhood summers and, well, we wish we could go back. This island is the next best thing - Honestly, a feel-good game about running around and doing good deeds Features: - Handcrafted visuals. Every little corner of the island has been looked after with great detail. Trust me, it took us a while to make it - Join Alba and Ines to found the AIWRL (really rolls off the tongue doesn't it?), an organization that can save the island - You will need to gather a bunch of volunteers and the town is full of good people. Help them out and inspire them to join you - There are animals everywhere, can you find all the species?", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "June 9, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Ustwo Games", "publishers": "Plug In Digital", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba:_A_Wildlife_Adventure", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCWidTG_6to", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/216883-alba-a-wildlife-adventure\n"}
