{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mech Mechanic Simulator", "overview": "Mechs are our future! What happens when cars are no longer around? Gigantic robots take over! Powerful, destructive and strong... They are used in sports, at war... and for you, they are moneymakers. Become a Mech Mechanic and open your own workshop to dismantle, fix and rebuild gigantic robots. Every mech has its own special purpose and as a Mech Mechanic not only will you be able to diagnose, repair or change the parts but also paint, update and accommodate mechs for their new function. Even if you\u2019re the best Mech Mechanic in the world, you\u2019ll find the parts that are unfixable. Do what you can with what you\u2019ve got, but if you find some junk among your parts\u2026 dismount it and order new ones. If you don\u2019t like wasting things, don\u2019t worry! Mech Mechanic Simulator lets you remanufacture and renew the parts. It\u2019s your choice: sell, recast or restore your parts! Gain some respect among other corporations and get access to more advanced machinery. But be careful, it\u2019s not that easy. You\u2019ll have a lot of expenses.

If you don\u2019t want to be put out of business, you\u2019ll have to make your workshop look good as well. Can you maintain a good reputation? Become an expert in your field and compete with the most powerful corporations of the future. Who\u2019s going to produce the most modern, technologically advanced mech? Make sure it\u2019s you!
