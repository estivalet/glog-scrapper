{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snipperclips: Cut It Out, Together!", "overview": "Hey, cut it out! No, really! In this action-puzzle game, paper pals Snip and Clip must cut each other up to overcome tricky obstacles\u2026or just to laugh their heads off (sometimes literally). Partner up with friends or family to cut the heroes into the right shapes, interact with objects, and solve a world of imaginative puzzles. When playing together, prove you're a cut above the rest in Blitz mode, where 2-4 players* can compete in a series of puzzlingly action-packed challenges. Three is never a crowd when you're paper thin, so make it a party! In Party mode, up to four players can team up to solve tough challenges. Ready or not, this couch co-op is a riot, any way you cut it!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "March 3, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SFB Games", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipperclips", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSp-4OYElS0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82483-snipperclips-cut-it-out-together\n"}
