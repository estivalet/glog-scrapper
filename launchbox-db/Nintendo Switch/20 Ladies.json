{"altername_name": [], "name": "20 Ladies", "overview": "Relax with a casual platformer where the entire objective is to find lady friends hidden throughout the stage! Enter a world of simple pleasures and minimalistic design, where your only goal is to navigate cleverly arranged stages, avoid spikes and locate beautiful female companions hidden in the environment. But beware of hazards! Break a heart three times, and you\u2019ll instantly respawn at the beginning, with your lady counter reset to zero. You\u2019ll need to touch them all without dying in order to proceed to the next stage and unlock an alluring image for each one you complete. Platforms in the foreground are silhouetted against lush hand-drawn backdrops. Clouds pass by overhead, trees sway in the breeze and historical architecture dots the landscape as mellow tunes accompany you on a chill quest for love. Your best times are tracked with each playthrough, inviting you to come back and top your own record.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 19, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "eastasiasoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156697-20-ladies\n"}
