{"altername_name": ["Pan-Dimensional Conga Combat"], "name": "Pan-Dimensional Conga Combat", "overview": "Pan-Dimensional Conga Combat is an old-school, rhythm-synchronised, score-chasing arcade game that plays like some alien coin-op from another dimension. Grab your Conganoid and join the competitive ceremonial slaughter of annoyingly happy (yet extremely deadly) geometric, pan-dimensional critters! Defend yourself using your bullet tail, close portals by looping around them, and charge up your hyper-destructive mega-lazor by laying a path of bullets in front of the mindless, drifting Purploids. Oh, and stay the hell away from the EVIL X - those dudes are BAD news! Play solo in Arcade or Survival mode - perfect for that coffee-break adrenaline blast! - or choose multiplayer mode to battle your friends and family for high-score supremacy! FEATURES: - Rhythm-synchronized arcade action! - Four different dimensions to unlock! - Two different single-player modes! - Local four-player high-score battle mode! - Heavyweight acid/chip/funk soundtrack! - Online Leaderboards!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 21, 2023", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Thalamus Digital", "publishers": "RGCD.DEV", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256706990/movie480.webm?t=1517268476", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373932-pan-dimensional-conga-combat\n"}
