The Great Tournament is offering the hand of the princess as a prize. Go from local brigand to champion. Or don\u2019t.

It\u2019s madness and mayhem with true comedic flair. Key Features: \u2022 Grand Theft Horse: Wreak havoc in a medieval world inspired by classic GTA gameplay.

Spend your time completing quests, wreaking havoc and having a laugh at the expense of others! \u2022 A Lot of Horsin\u2019 Around: Shoot cows into the sky, drag your neighbors through the mud, toss some holy hand grenades, or draw fancy pictures in the field with a plow. \u2022 Minstrelsy of Power: Hire a musical companion to play the tunes you like and add a powerful soundtrack to your adventures.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 31, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Jutsu Games", "publishers": "Modus Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytkuEJkVR3U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155960-rustler\n"}
