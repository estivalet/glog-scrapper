Grab the other Joy-Con and play with a friend! \"A beautiful masterpiece\", \"inventive, moving and unrelentingly funny\", \"a deft statement on games and how we play them\" \u2014 Little Inferno is an unusual game filled with surprise and wonder, and even better the less you know about it before playing!

From the creators of World of Goo and Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure.
