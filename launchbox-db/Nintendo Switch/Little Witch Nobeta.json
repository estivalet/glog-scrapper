You must discover enemies' weaknesses and learn the precise time to dodge attacks in order to gain the advantage in combat. Game feature: Complete plot cutscenes. Moderate puzzle-solving elements. Various combat styles including physical melee attacks and four types of magic: Arcane, Ice, Fire, and Thunder.
