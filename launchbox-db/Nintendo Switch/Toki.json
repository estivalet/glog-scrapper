A masterfully made remake: The game has been entirely redrawn by hand by Philippe Dessoly, illustrator of well-known manga cartoons, such as Captain Harlock and UFO Robot Grendizer, comics and video games. He also worked on the Amiga version of Toki back in 1991 and the game Mr. Nutz in 1992. His drawings have further improved Toki's apish good looks. The music has been fully re-orchestrated by composer Rapha\u00ebl Gesqua, providing a retro and modern soundtrack for Toki's adventure. This award-winning composer has created the music for more than one hundred video games. On the technical side, developer Pierre Adane has worked tirelessly to bring this thrilling experience to life. He also worked on Mr. Nutz (1992) and created the tennis game Top Spin (2003).", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "December 4, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Golgoth Studio", "publishers": "Microids", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OALKMbGjFw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127200-toki\n"}
