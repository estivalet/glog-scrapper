{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quest of Dungeons", "overview": "Quest of Dungeons is a turn-based dungeon crawler game: a roguelike featuring a good old 16-bit, retro artistic look. An evil Dark Lord has stolen all the light, so your mission is to enter his lair and defeat him. By playing as either a Warrior, a Wizard, an Assassin or a Shaman, you have to traverse dungeons, defeat enemies and loot everything you can in order to survive. You can learn new skills in Tomes you find along the way and buy/sell items at shops. The entire game is procedural so you won't find items/enemies in the same place each time you play. Features: Procedural dungeons Procedural weapons Boss encounters Quests 4 Difficulty levels Permadeath - Once you die, game over man, game over! Shop - buy and sell items/weapons Leaderboards - compare your Adventure points with the community", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 14, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Upfall Studios", "publishers": "Upfall Studios", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156966-quest-of-dungeons\n"}
