{"altername_name": [], "name": "Timespinner", "overview": "Travel back in time to change fate itself, in this beautifully crafted story-driven adventure, inspired by classic 90s action-platformers. With her family murdered in front of her and the ancient Timespinner device destroyed, Lunais is suddenly transported into an unknown world, stranded with seemingly no hope of return. Using her power to control time, Lunais vows to take her revenge on the evil Lachiem Empire, but sometimes the course of history isn\u2019t quite as black and white as it seems... Explore a vast, connected world with beautifully drawn and detailed pixel art environments. Traverse between the barren present and luscious past of Lachiem, collecting elemental magic orbs and combining their power to destroy enemies with blades and spells. Befriend mysterious creatures called Familiars, such as the adorable dream dragon Meyef, and train them to aid you in battle. Test your skills and timing with intense boss battles, and you venture forth to take on the Emperor himself!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "June 4, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Lunar Ray Games", "publishers": "Chucklefish", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timespinner", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C38V0npJW9E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116384-timespinner\n"}
