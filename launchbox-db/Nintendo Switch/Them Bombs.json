{"altername_name": [], "name": "Them Bombs", "overview": "Them Bombs is a 2D couch co-op game for 2-4 people, in which one of the players has to defuse a bomb by disarming all of its modules before the timer runs out. However, the player can only properly disarm a module if they are guided by another player(s), whose task is to read the instructions from the bomb defusal manual. In order to defuse the bomb, the Unlikely Hero and the Expert have to cooperate. That, above all, means verbal communication, as the Expert needs to explain all the steps of solving a module to the Unlikely Hero, and the Unlikely Hero must carefully describe the modules, ask the right questions and correctly interpret the answers.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yellow Dot Games", "publishers": "Yellow Dot Games", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmyhKIxWB_w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116903-them-bombs\n"}
