{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hotline Miami Collection", "overview": "Hotline Miami Collection contains both legendary games in the neon-soaked, brutally-challenging Hotline Miami series from Dennaton Games. Set in 1989 Miami, the game revolves primarily around an unnamed silent protagonist\u2014dubbed \"Jacket\" by fans\u2014who has been receiving coded messages on his answering machine instructing him to commit massacres against the local Russian mafia. The game blends top-down perspective with stealth, extreme violence and surreal storytelling, along with a soundtrack and visuals inspired by 1980s culture. The game itself was influenced in part by Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 neo-noir crime film Drive, as well as the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 19, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Dennaton Games", "publishers": "Devolver Digital", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6pBJjEuaOI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117799-hotline-miami-collection\n"}
