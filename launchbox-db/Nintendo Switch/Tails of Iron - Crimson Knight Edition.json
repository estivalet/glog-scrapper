{"altername_name": ["Tails of Iron"], "name": "Tails of Iron: Crimson Knight Edition", "overview": "Set in a grim land plagued by war, Tails of Iron is a hand-drawn RPG Adventure with punishingly brutal combat. As Redgi, heir to the Rat Throne, you must restore your broken Kingdom by banishing the merciless Frog Clan and their ferocious leader, Greenwart. As you explore the deceivingly charming world, you\u2019ll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure. And you\u2019ll need all the help you can get, whether that\u2019s new meal recipes, blueprints to forge deadly weapons and armour, or even a land-chugging, armour-plated mole mobile! Overcome your fears. Rescue your brothers. Restore Your Kingdom. Your tail has begun\u2026 Master Brutal Combat From frog zombies to gargantuan grubs - and everything in-between - the Kingdom is awash with danger. To overcome each perilous encounter, you\u2019ll need to study your opponent\u2019s attacks and react accordingly! Thankfully, there\u2019s a range of deadly abilities at your disposal, including parry bashes and fatal executions, not to mention ranged attacks with your nifty bow and arrow. Explore a Treacherous Kingdom Fully accompanied by the deep, raspy narrations of Doug Cockle (voice of Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher), prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the mediaeval-fantasy Rat Kingdom. Complete side quests and faction hunts for some additional gold-on-the-side, or join forces with a sharp-eyed companion to help even the playing field. Customise your Attack Adapt Redgi\u2019s combat style to the task at hand. Heavy armour may provide better protection but can you really afford to slow down your dodge-roll? And then there\u2019s the question of weapon; axes pack a punch, while spears are quick and nimble. Perhaps you\u2019d prefer the all-round performance of a trusty broadsword? Overcome Savage Boss Fights While danger lurks around every toadstool, you\u2019ll need to keep your wits sharp and your blade sharper when it comes to the devastating boss fights. Cold-blooded in every sense of the word, these oversized amphibians each present their own unique combat challenge, and you\u2019ll need more than a good set of armour to come out on top. Brew Recipes, Craft Weapons, Forge Armour Redgi\u2019s keep is also home to his brothers, Rem-Rem, Bam-Bam and Dug. Rem can cook up a health-boosting feast with ingredients found throughout the world, while Bam can craft new weapons and armors from special blueprints you\u2019ll uncover\u2026 if you look hard enough. And then there\u2019s Dug, who\u2019ll update you about new quests available throughout the Kingdom.
