{"altername_name": ["Snipperclips Plus"], "name": "Snipperclips Plus: Cut It Out, Together!", "overview": "Paper pals Snip and Clip must cut each other into the right shapes to overcome tricky obstacles in this updated version of the game. Partner up with friends or family to solve puzzles, including new comic book and toy box worlds, and more! Plus, play the original levels in new shapes! No matter how you cut it, this couch co-op is a riot! Snip may need to cut Clip into a needle to pop balloons or maybe you'll have to team up to form a squawking, egg-laying bird! Prove you're a cut above the rest in Blitz mode, where 2-4 players can compete in a series of puzzlingly action-packed challenges. Make it a party with Party mode, where up to four players can team up to solve fun puzzles.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 10, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SFB Games", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipperclips", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY92izbU5Ng", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87607-snipperclips-plus-cut-it-out-together\n"}
