{"altername_name": ["SNK Heroines ~Tag Team Frenzy~"], "name": "SNK HEROINES: Tag Team Frenzy", "overview": "Several days after the previous The King of Fighters tournament, many of the female fighters suddenly fall unconscious. Upon waking, they find themselves in a strange mansion, along with Terry Bogard who has been changed into a woman. The fighters attempt to battle their way out, but are confronted by the mastermind, Kukri, who reveals he has trapped them in his castle in a pocket dimension and they must defeat him to return home. SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy is a versus fighting game where each player uses two characters per fight but the players also choose an \"Attacker\" that serves as the playable character as well as a \"Supporter\" that assist the former. In contrast to other fighting games, it is impossible to defeat the enemy with a normal move, necessitating the use of a finishing move called the \"Dream Finish\". A move button can protect the character, while items are included for further gameplay features. The game offers a story with different dialogues occurring depending on the characters fighting. Each character has additional costumes; cosmetic items are available to the players if they wish to change their characters' visual appearances. There is an online mode alongside an Spectator Mode where players can see other people's fights.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 7, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "NIS America", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNK_Heroines:_Tag_Team_Frenzy", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RwMBshXIPI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109967-snk-heroines-tag-team-frenzy\n"}
