{"altername_name": [], "name": "Darksiders Genesis", "overview": "From the dawn of creation, the council has maintained the Balance across existence. Carrying out their orders are the Horsemen, Nephilim (powerful beings spawned from the unnatural union of angels and demons) who have pledged themselves to the Council and been granted immense power. However, this power came at a tragic cost: the Horsemen were ordered to use their newfound strength to wipe out the rest of their kind. What followed was a bloody battle on Eden where the Horsemen, obeying the will of the Council, annihilated the Nephilim. Darksiders: Genesis is an action/adventure that tears its way through hordes of demons, angels, and everything in-between on its way to Hell and back with guns blazing and swords swinging. Genesis gives players their first look at the world of Darksiders before the events of the original game, as well as introduces the horseman Strife.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 14, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Airship Syndicate Entertainment Inc", "publishers": "THQ Nordic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148420-darksiders-genesis\n"}
