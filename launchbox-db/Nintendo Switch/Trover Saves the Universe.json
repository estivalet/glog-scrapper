Your dogs have been dognapped by a beaked lunatic named Glorkon who stuffed them into his eye holes and is using their life essence to destroy the universe. You're partnered with Trover, a little purple eye-hole monster who isn\u2019t a huge fan of working or being put in the position of having to save the universe. He\u2019s also not that big a fan of you quite frankly, and neither am I. (Jk, you\u2019re great.) Only you and Trover can save everything in this bizarre comedy adventure, created by Justin Roiland!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 28, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Squanch Games", "publishers": "Limited Run Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trover_Saves_the_Universe", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98sGdwzvfbU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145373-trover-saves-the-universe\n"}
