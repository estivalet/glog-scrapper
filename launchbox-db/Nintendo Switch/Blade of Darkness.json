{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blade of Darkness", "overview": "A grim new threat looms over The Central Kingdoms. The borders protected by the fierce King\u2019s Knights are no longer secure. The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably. Chaos seizes the World. Only the memory of the oldest recalls the exploits of a hero and a few warriors, who in other times fought against the forces of Chaos. Ianna, the mother of all living beings, gave the hero a powerful sword to enter the abyss and defeat evil. But that happened a long time ago. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who is worthy to wield the Sword and destroy the enemy... this time forever.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 24, 2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Rebel Act Studios", "publishers": "QubicGames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance:_Blade_of_Darkness", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167395-blade-of-darkness\n"}
