{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heroland", "overview": "Part-time heroes wanted for a retro RPG adventure! You're invited to a magical resort where anyone can be a hero - except for you. You just work there! Luckily, it's on an island where dreams come true... for a price. As a tour guide, your job is to lead \"heroes\" safely through the theme park's dungeons. Customize strategies, repair weapons, and manage items to survive! Recruit over 20 quirky characters, including upright knights, phantom thieves, high school girls, and one casually nihilistic otter/man. Meet and defeat a colorful cast of coworkers such as monstrous mascots, cute li'l slugs, selfie-loving skeletons, and magical broccoli! Behold the splendor of 2D sprites that have been turned, alchemy-like, into 3D models who bend and stretch through THE THIRD DIMENSION! Conjured from your 16-bit dreams by the legends of retro Japanese RPGs, this whimsical tale of princes and part-timers guarantees excitement that cannot be forgotten.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "December 3, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "FuRyu", "publishers": "Xseed Games", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNlsBXpJZA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130492-heroland\n"}
