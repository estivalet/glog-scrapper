{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kingdom Rush: Frontiers", "overview": "Bigger and badder than ever before, Kingdom Rush: Frontiers is a whole new level of the furiously fast, enchantingly charming gameplay that made the original title an award-winning hit. Tap your troops through an epic (mis)adventure as you defend exotic lands from dragons, man-eating plants, and ghastly denizens of the underworld -all with flashy new towers, levels, heroes, and more goodies to help you crush your foes to a pulp. (Don't worry, we've still got all the good ol' stuff from the last game, too. It's vintage now.) Kingdom Rush: Frontiers packs in so much content, it's like a fully upgraded artillery blast of mouthwatering, pixelated joy launched right into your smiling little face... and it hurts so good! GAME FEATURES Over 60 enemies with unique abilities! Stay on your toes as you fight through desert sandworms, tribal shamans, nomad tribes and underground terrors. 16 legendary heroes. Choose your champions and train their abilities! Each has unique specialties that fit different play styles! Hours of gameplay with over 80 achievements! Three difficulty modes! Are you up for a real challenge? Go with Veteran mode! Intoxicating charm with a rousing score, full-bodied voice-overs and lovingly illustrated cartoon art!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 27, 2020", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "", "publishers": "Ironhide Game Studio", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126141-kingdom-rush-frontiers\n"}
