The day before school started back, Tootuff heard that it was possible to clone sheep by selecting the very best specimens. Terrified about the idea of being infinitely duplicated, Tootuff shares his concerns with his friends. Fortunately, Hugo always has a solution. If only the best are destined to be cloned, you just have to be as naughty as possible to avoid being chosen.
