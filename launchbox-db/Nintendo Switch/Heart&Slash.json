{"altername_name": ["Heart & Slash", "Heart and Slash"], "name": "Heart&Slash", "overview": "Heart&Slash is a 3D brawler roguelike robot love story set in a world where machines are all that remains from human civilization. You play as Heart, a sentient robot fighting to escape the grip of the evil and all seeing machine QuAsSy (Quality Assurance Systems). But make no mistake, Heart&Slash is no walk in the park. Every death is permanent and means a new randomly generated level for you to start over with a different set of weapons and items you can use, new enemies to fight and secrets to explore. Heart&Slash offers players something new and challenging because it is not about mastering one system, rather adapting to what is provided and making the most of it.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "December 22, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Aheartfulofgames S.L.", "publishers": "BadLand Games Publishing, S.L.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156914-heartslash\n"}
