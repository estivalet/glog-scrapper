Characters Haru A bit lazy and a lot naive, Haru nonetheless is a kind soul and knows how to handle himself if push comes to shove. Kuroko She might be short and cute (sometimes), but don't let that fool you: Kuroko is exceedingly capable in battle and always willing to step up. She's also fond of technology - maybe a bit too much so.
