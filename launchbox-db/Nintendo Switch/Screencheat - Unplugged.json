ELEVEN RETRO-INSPIRED MAPS In the spirit of the best arena shooters, you\u2019ll spend time traversing 11 maps via air vents and trampolines until you\u2019ve acquired your target and fragged them accordingly. Each map is designed with colour-coded areas as well as plentiful landmarks that allow you to quickly locate other players without being able to actually see them. CUSTOMISE AND MUTATE We've got heaps of customisation options so you can play the game however you want! Choose which weapons are allowed, adjust player attributes, victory conditions, penalties and more.
