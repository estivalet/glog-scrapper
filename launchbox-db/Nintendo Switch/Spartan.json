Magical portals begin to appear throughout ancient Greece. As a king and the world's most fearsome warrior, Leonidas sets out to discover who is behind the threat, and recover everything that was stolen. You, are King Leo. And your aim is to make whoever is responsible and whatever stands in your way, rue the day they crossed your path. Block, stomp, run, jump, fall, climb, cling, push, spring & slice your way to victory. Outsmart intelligent enemies, tread carefully through obstacles and use your wits to defeat bosses in epic battles. THIS.. IS.. Spartan!
