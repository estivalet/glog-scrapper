{"altername_name": [], "name": "Decarnation", "overview": "Decarnation is a story rich adventure horror game. Solve cryptic puzzles, fight disturbing enemies and explore a phantasmagorical world of dreams and nightmares. The Story: Paris, 1990. Gloria is at the end of her rope. A struggling cabaret dancer dealing with the fraying of her relationships, career, and self-esteem, she takes on a new artistic endeavor sponsored by a mysterious benefactor. Would the generous proposal be Gloria's lucky break, or something worse? A survival story with layered psychological stakes, Decarnation explores the contrast between battling limitations in the physical realm, and the subconscious landscapes one can't escape. The Game: Decarnation mixes traditional survival horror elements (cryptic puzzle to solve, inhospitable environments to explore, lethal predators to avoid, terrifying boss to defeat, etc.) with a wide variety of symbolic minigames (puzzles, reflexes, rhythm, etc.) accounting for real life situations (performing a cabaret show on stage) or metaphorical ones. Once uncovered, key elements of Gloria's life aid her in defeating monsters in her dreams in unique battles that marry the grotesque and the sublime to represent her struggle for survival. Overcoming challenges in her dreams strengthens Gloria against real life difficulties, and her real life issues create new challenges in her dreams. Decarnation is an emotional, startling story-driven experience that will keep you on your toes until the very end.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "May 31, 2023", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Atelier QDB", "publishers": "East2west Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmeL6rfuJS8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370044-decarnation\n"}
