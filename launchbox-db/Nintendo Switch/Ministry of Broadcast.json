{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ministry of Broadcast", "overview": "A country divided by The Wall. To cross it and reach your family, you must compete on - and win - a reality TV show broadcast by the Regime. Ministry of Broadcast is a narrative-driven single player cinematic platformer mixing Orwell\u2019s 1984 with modern reality TV. Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and the absurdity of the system. Seemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on \u201cThe Wall Show\u201d, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems. FEATURES * Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them. * Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game\u2019s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs. * Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas. You\u2019ll have to interact with the environment itself to solve most of the puzzles: use the protagonist\u2019s momentum to move platforms, flip the occasional lever, and sometimes you might have to sacrifice an NPC or two to cross a particularly spiky pit. * Story and Personality: Featuring lots of impish humor, Grade A sarcasm, and comic mischief, all balanced perfectly with the dark, heavy themes presented in this dystopian world.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 30, 2020", "game_type": "", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Ministry Of Broadcast Studios", "publishers": "Hitcents", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135474-ministry-of-broadcast\n"}
