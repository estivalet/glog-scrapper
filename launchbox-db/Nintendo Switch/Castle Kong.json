{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle Kong", "overview": "Castle Kong is Drowning Monkeys homage to what we consider the best game ever made. What makes the golden age of arcade gaming so fun is a simple concept: 1 coin (Meaning no restarts or additional lives. there are no actual or virtual coins for the Switch version of the game), 3 lives. play till you die or hit the kill screen, and set a high score. And that's what Castle Kong is all about. Just like the game it's based on, CK will be a ruthless, 4 stage, 22 level romp! You play PauperBoy, a young kid who sets out to save PrincessGirl from the evil clutches of BaronMan. Unlike it's predecessors, we leverage the power of connectivity to host tournaments (with a championship!), verify high scores, and have a global leaderboard. And As Always, if anyone's interested, a kill screen is coming up.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 25, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Drowning Monkeys Games", "publishers": "Drowning Monkeys Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEVXncl3XQQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160574-castle-kong\n"}
