{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flip Wars", "overview": "Flip Wars is an action party game for the Nintendo Switch. The game can be played locally against human players or CPU's and online up to four human players. Each of the four players are placed on a board with the goal to flip the most panels by jumping into the air and slamming them rear-first, flipping them to the color corresponding to the player. Flipping tiles can reveal power-ups such as \"flipping-range increase\" and \"increasing running speed\". Depending on the chosen battle-mode the game ends when the timer runs out and the dominating player wins. Three games modes Panel Battle, Knock Out Battle and Life Battle are available at the start each with their variety of rules and regulations. Panel Battle sees the player dominating the battle with the most colors of his character win the battle. Knock Out Battle winners are determined by knocking out your opponent outside of the game board the most. Life Battle is an elimination, 3-lives version of Knock Out Battle, where after thrown out of the playing field three times, no re-entry is possible and the last man standing is the winner.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "May 18, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Over Fence Co.
