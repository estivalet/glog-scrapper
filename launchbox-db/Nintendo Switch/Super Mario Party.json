{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Mario Party", "overview": "The original 4-player Mario Party series board game mode that fans love is back, and your friends and family are invited to the party! Freely walk the board: choose where to move, which Dice Block to roll, and how to win the most Stars in skill-based minigames. Wait till you see the 2 vs 2 mode with grid-based maps, the creative uses of the console, and the series\u2019 first online minigame mode! Test your skills in sets of five minigames with the new mode, Mariothon, and see how you stack up against players across the globe in Online Mariothon*. Whether you\u2019re pedaling tricycles, flipping meat, or who knows what else, you\u2019ll use Joy-Con controllers in clever ways across 80 new minigames; some are all-out free-for-alls, others are 2 vs 2, or even 1 vs 3! Toad\u2019s Rec Room lets you pair up two Nintendo Switch systems**, which you\u2019ll lay side-by-side on a flat surface like a real tabletop game. That way you can play a mini baseball game, battle tanks in custom arenas, or even see who can match the most bananas by repositioning the systems however you see fit!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 5, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EPD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Party", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7zTJLIYJds", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106264-super-mario-party\n"}
