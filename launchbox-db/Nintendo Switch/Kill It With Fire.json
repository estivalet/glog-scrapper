As a licensed Kill It With Fire exterminator, it\u2019s time to fight back! Assemble your arsenal of increasingly excessive weapons, track spiders across suburbia, and burn everything in your path! To defeat spiders you must exploit their one weakness: FIRE. Or bullets. Or explosions, throwing stars, gettin\u2019 smushed by stuff...pretty much anything, really. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be easy - first you\u2019ve gotta find the spiders. Use state-of-the-art arachnid tracking technology to pinpoint your quarry\u2019s location among hundreds of potential hiding spots - then, torch everything and smash the spider with a frying pan after it runs out.
