Wield wild weapons and execute deadly moves, like the powerful Umbran Climax, to take out angels and demons in this breathtaking action game. You can even team up with friends in 2-player online or local wireless co-op fights. Bayonetta is a butt-kicking, havoc-wreaking witch who wields sweet weapons like pistols, whips, hammers, flamethrowers, and poison bows. But it's not just about brawn - it's also about style. Bayonetta is deadly but sleek, with moves like Witch Time that slows down time itself, and the all-new Umbran Climax - a special magic attack that summons Infernal Demons to devastate enemies.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 16, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "PlatinumGames", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonetta_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN-lQc2slvM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95451-bayonetta-2\n"}
