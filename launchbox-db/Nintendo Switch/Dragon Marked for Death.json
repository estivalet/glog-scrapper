{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Marked for Death", "overview": "They bear the mark of the Astral Dragon in this dark fantasy style action RPG! Dragon Marked For Death is a side-scrolling 2D action RPG that can played solo or with up to four players in local or online multiplayer. You play as the survivors of the Dragonblood Clan who set out to take revenge on the Kingdom of Medius, who destroyed their home and captured the Dragonblood Oracle, Amica. To obtain the power they need to enact their revenge, they forge a pact with the Astral Dragon Atruum. Use your newly acquired powers to take on quests from villagers and raise your status in the kingdom. How you perform in these quests can have a direct effect on the game's final outcome. Quests aren't all about defeating enemies, though. You'll guard a ship's passengers from monsters, search for hidden treasure, rescue a princess from a castle under siege, and a lot more!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "January 31, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Inti Creates", "publishers": "Inti Creates", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5adTeN20dk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112772-dragon-marked-for-death\n"}
