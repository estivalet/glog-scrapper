TY the Tasmanian Tiger\u2122 2: Bush Rescue\u2122 is the sequel to Krome Studios' charming Australiana-themed videogame. This classic platformer, updated for Nintendo Switch\u2122, features more rangs, more vehicles, more bots, and more EVERYTHING... in an open world Aussie Adventure. Throw boomerangs, bite, smash and glide your way around the Australian Outback and stop the evil plans of the wicked Boss Cass and help the good folk of the little country town of BURRAMUDGEE. This sequel to the popular TY the Tasmanian Tiger is a game on a grander scale. In addition to classic platforming elements, you'll fight Aussie bush fires from a helicopter, drive around Southern Rivers while hanging on to the back of a four-wheel drive and use the bots to defeat enemies and solve puzzles - all while trying to find a variety of different collectables. And now, only in the HD remaster, you can customise TY's looks, and best of all there are two brand NEW never before seen boomerangs.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "March 30, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Krome Studios", "publishers": "Krome Studios", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151314-ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-2-bush-rescue-hd\n"}
