{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dark Burial", "overview": "You can do a lot with just one crossbow... Impale the forces of evil, of course, but also solve all sorts of platforming puzzles blocking your path. A dark army approaches your lands. It is your duty as first witness and sentinel to report to your people as soon as possible. Or is it too late? Not if your aim is fast and smart! Armed with your sturdy crossbow, slay skeletons, witches and other abominations who will regret leaving the underworld. The way ahead is unfortunately also full of pitfalls and hazards...but, again, nothing that a well-placed arrow can\u2019t answer! Take your courage (aka crossbow) in both hands and go light the signal fires! It is your sentinel\u2019s job, don\u2019t let your people down.
