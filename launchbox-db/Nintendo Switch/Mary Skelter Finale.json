{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mary Skelter Finale", "overview": "Mary Skelter Finale holds the same basic gameplay that defined Mary Skelter: Nightmares and Mary Skelter 2. Dungeon-crawling and the timing of dungeon features works on a turn-based system similar to the likes of Etrian Odyssey. Blood Maidens have special field abilities used to solve puzzles and navigate dungeons. By attacking the weaknesses of enemies and/or overkilling them, the player could accumulate Blood, allowing Blood Maidens to access the powerful Massacre or Blood Skelter states depending on their Corruption. Nightmares make a return as an unkillable boss requiring quick thinking to escape rather than by brute-forcing the solution.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 5, 2020", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Compile Heart", "publishers": "Idea Factory", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142566-mary-skelter-finale\n"}
