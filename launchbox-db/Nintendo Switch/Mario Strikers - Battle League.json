Band together with up to 20 strikers online* and compete against other clubs for points. Find the right club for you, team up with friends, and bring your own striker style to the table. Strive to become the world\u2019s top club each season! 8 players can go for the goal on one Nintendo Switch system, with local wireless**, or online*.
