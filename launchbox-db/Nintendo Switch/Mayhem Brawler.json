TO PROTECT AND SERVE While answering a routine call on a patrol, Dolphin, Star and Trouble -the most popular officers of the super-powered law enforcement agency, Stronghold- find themselves in a sequence of events that will alter the fate of the entire city. EXCESSIVE FORCE Let\u2019s get one thing straight; if you ever think that a day in the life of a super-powered law enforcer is easy, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong, as there are greater threats than street gangs in urban fantasy themed Mayhem Brawler.
