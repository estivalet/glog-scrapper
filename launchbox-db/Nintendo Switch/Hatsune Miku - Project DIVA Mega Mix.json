{"altername_name": ["Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega39s"], "name": "Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix", "overview": "On July 1, 2019, in honor of the franchise's 10th anniversary, Sega announced Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega39's for the Nintendo Switch. The game includes 101 songs, including 10 new songs (which were later released as a DLC port to the Future Tone game), a more anime-like art style featuring cel shaded graphics, and new gameplay modes that utilize the Joy-Con controllers. At Magical Mirai 2019, Sega announced that the game would be released in Japan on February 13, 2020, and in Western regions on May 15, 2020. Western versions are retitled Mega Mix; the Japanese title is a pun based on the Japanese pronunciation of \"39's\", which sounds similar to \"Miku's\" and \"Mix\". Additionally, a limited edition bundle with a five-disc soundtrack and art book among other items was made available alongside the game's Japanese release.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 13, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA#Project_DIVA", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/T74gVhg58Tg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130266-hatsune-miku-project-diva-mega-mix\n"}
