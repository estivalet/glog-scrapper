{"altername_name": [], "name": "Odallus: The Dark Call", "overview": "Haggis, a retired warrior, must wield his sword once more after he finds his village in flames, his son kidnapped, and darkness spreading across the land collecting souls for its demon army. Old gods have abandoned the world and new ones are on the rise with the help of the Odallus, the ultimate power. Odallus: The Dark Call is a dark fantasy, 2D Platformer inspired by games such as Castlevania, Demon's Crest, and Ghouls 'N Ghosts. Although not a true \"Metroidvania\" due to areas being separated by traditional levels, many attributes like exploration, health and armor upgrades, and \"relics\" which open up new areas remain the focus of the core gameplay. There are eight levels in total, featuring a sub-boss and standard final boss. The map screen is similar to that of Castlevania: Dracula X, highlighting alternate paths in addition to showing the number of secrets found and whether or not the boss has been slain. 'Veteran Mode' was later added into the Steam version making an already difficult game even harder.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 8, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "JoyMasher", "publishers": "Digerati Distribution & Marketing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155982-odallus-the-dark-call\n"}
