La-Mulana 1 & 2 are two critically acclaimed, devilishly twisted puzzle platformers, and they're worth their weight in gold. With your trusty whip in one hand and an arsenal of guns, shuriken, and other sub-weapons in the other, you'll be able to take on dangerous foes while maneuvering through the nefarious traps of the ruins. Use items like the Ankh to call upon and challenge the ancient Guardians in order to advance. Solve the cryptic puzzles of Eg-Lana using ancient relics such as tablets and keys, and even modern tools like Yagoo software and the Glyph Reader. And when all else fails, push around or smash objects to crack the mysteries wide open!", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "March 17, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "NIGORO", "publishers": "NIS America", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGi-CXoFZEM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371379-la-mulana-1-2-hidden-treasures-edition\n"}
