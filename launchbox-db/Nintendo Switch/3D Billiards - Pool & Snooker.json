In addition to the pool hall classic eight-ball, you can also play nine-ball, ten-ball and even snooker!

Choose from ten attractive avatars as you duel against AI opponents of varying difficulty levels. Get pumped up by the engaging pool-playing soundtrack. And listen closely for the authentic sound effects, like the clack of the balls, collisions, breaks and the characteristic way the balls roll across the table.
