{"altername_name": [], "name": "War of Stealth: Assassin", "overview": "This is a stealth action, top-down shooter with armed soldiers and zombies which has a sci fi style and rude and rectilinear humor. You play as a soldier who enters a secret base to get information about the work that goes on there. The main hero doesn`t expect the base to have so many blood-chilling secrets. The game gives thrills with the possibility to play quiet and stealthy but you can also shoot if you are ready for it.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "April 22, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Plitka Games", "publishers": "Kurenter", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156786-war-of-stealth-assassin\n"}
