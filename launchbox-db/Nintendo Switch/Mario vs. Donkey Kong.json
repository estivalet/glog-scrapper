{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario vs. Donkey Kong", "overview": "Mario vs. Donkey Kong returns to the gaming world as a side-scrolling puzzle-platformer exclusively for the Nintendo Switch. This title is a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance game that shares its name. Visually, the game has undergone a significant transformation; Moving away from the original's pre-rendered visuals and the subsequent series' plastic, cartoony aesthetics, the remake embraces a modern art direction. This contemporary approach draws inspiration from \"Super Mario 3D World\" and its representation within \"Super Mario Maker 2.\" Furthermore, the game introduces a fresh logo design for the esteemed Donkey Kong series. Feature List: 3D Models: Unlike its predecessor which utilized pre-rendered sprites, the remake showcases full 3D models. Animated Cutscenes: The storytelling is enhanced with fully animated cutscenes, offering more dynamism than the original's static frames. Redesigned Characters: Updated designs for characters like Tane Pakkun, which have transformed into mechanical Fire Piranha Plants. Toy Ninjis now bear a resemblance to the current design of regular Ninjis, and Brickmen feature movable bricks over their eyes for added expression. Multiplayer Mode: For the first time, players can venture with a friend with the addition of Toad as a second playable character. Language Options: The game has broadened its accessibility with translations in Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Dutch, and Korean \u2013 languages that were absent in the original. It also includes Canadian French and Latin American Spanish translations.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "February 16, 2024", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo Software Technology", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sPwqplxHXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372463-mario-vs-donkey-kong\n"}
