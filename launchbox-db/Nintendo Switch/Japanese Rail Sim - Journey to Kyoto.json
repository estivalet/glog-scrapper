{"altername_name": [], "name": "Japanese Rail Sim: Journey to Kyoto", "overview": "This update to Japanese Rail Sim 3D: Journey to Kyoto brings players back to Kyoto with new features. As with the previous version, this game is a first-person train driving simulator; players are responsible for driving the train safely and stopping for passengers. Journeys are presented via a mixture of live-action footage of the actual train route and a real-time 3D rendered conductor's cabin. All of the footage has been recorded in autumn, prominently featuring the area's famous autumn scenery. Players can drive both directions through all of the routes, and an in-game guidebook provides information on real-world sightseeing spots along the game's train lines. While the original release featured only the Eizan line, this new version adds the Kurama line (runs between Takaragaike and Kurama) and the Hiei sightseeing train (opened 2018, runs to the foot of Mount Hiei). A new achievement system has been added, and a new beginners' guide provides in-game tutorials.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 28, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sonic Powered", "publishers": "Sonic Powered", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136970-japanese-rail-sim-journey-to-kyoto\n"}
