Episode 1: Daughters of Amalgam", "overview": "Trouble Witches is a comical witch side-scrolling shooter game. This story doesn\u2019t take place in the present, but in a dream-like world where life thrives in abundance without fear-Karunbunkurs. Here, time passes slowly like a huge wave; people and nature exist together in eternal harmony and prosperity. Beings living here discovered a miraculous power, which was, at first, small, and then grew large enough to move the world. The power transformed into \u201cmana,\u201d a force that could only be handled by a chosen few, to whom it was entrusted. It has been used properly and passed down from generation to generation; now, after several millennia, the power has become common and natural, a convenient form of witchcraft.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "July 6, 2023", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio SiestA", "publishers": "Rocket-Engine", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz5nWIuUxC0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370401-trouble-witches-final-episode-1-daughters-of-amalgam\n"}
