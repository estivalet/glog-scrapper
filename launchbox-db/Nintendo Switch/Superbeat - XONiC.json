{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superbeat: XONiC", "overview": "Superbeat: Xonic is an rhythm action game which includes several different game modes aimed at different difficulty levels. The game can be played entirely by buttons or touch screen, or both. First-person perspective is presented like going through a tunnel while the notes are coming your way at high speed. They either go toward the left or right part of the screen, where you can tap them (or press the right button) when they approach you. Certain notes just require quick tap/press, some may require holding, and some may require movement which if not done using touch-screen can be achieved with analog control sticks. The game features a wide variety of tracks, many of which are available as a downloadable content.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "November 21, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Nurijoy", "publishers": "PM Studios", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbeat:_Xonic", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101545-superbeat-xonic\n"}
