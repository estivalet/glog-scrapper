The game's main antagonist, Android 21, was a normal human who eventually became an Android created by the Red Ribbon Army after her son became the model for Android 16. Once she awakens, she repairs 16 and uses the Dragon Balls to resurrect Frieza, Cell, Nappa, and the Ginyu Force, and seals away the powers and souls of all of Earth's strongest warriors. Wanting to control the hungry monster within her, she and 16 develop a linking system originally created by Dr. Gero in which a human soul (the player) can possess the warriors and provide them strength.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "September 28, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Arc System Works", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_FighterZ", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5mfUiDWYmE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106199-dragon-ball-fighterz\n"}
