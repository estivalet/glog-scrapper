{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bad North", "overview": "Your home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father\u2019s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake \u2013 this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival. Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red. It\u2019s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It\u2019s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans. Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "August 20, 2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Plausible Concept", "publishers": "Raw Fury", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_North", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKcjqmy6Zvo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112775-bad-north\n"}
