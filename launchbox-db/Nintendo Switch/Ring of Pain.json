{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ring of Pain", "overview": "Ring of Pain is a roguelike / card game / dungeon crawler mashup. Levels are generated randomly from decks of cards, and arranged in a format (like a ring) which lets you observe the level and strategise. As you interact with cards the dungeon dynamically adjusts based on what you're doing. Ring of Pain blends elements of modern roguelike/roguelite dungeon crawlers (Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon etc) with a turn-based card game, set in a world distorted by your mind. A cryptic world of fear and delusion", "platform": "Nintendo Switch", "release_date": "October 15, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Twice Different", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154010-ring-of-pain\n"}
