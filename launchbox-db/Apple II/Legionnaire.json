{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legionnaire", "overview": "As Caesar you command up to 10 legions against the numerically superior barbarians in battles to conquer Gaul. You have just a few legions and one cavalry along with Caesar's legion, and with these the battles increase in difficulty and size. While the legions are usually stronger than the barbarians, and Caesar's legion is the strongest on the map, you must use the terrain and superior training of the Roman legions to defeat the hordes or you'll be overwhelmed. One of the first real time strategy games, the difficulty is very high in the late campaigns.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "Avalon Hill", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371928-legionnaire\n"}
