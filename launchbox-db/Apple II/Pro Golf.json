Based upon 18 famous holes throughout the world, at the beginning of each hole the player receives a description of the real world course. The game allows a roster of players to be created to allow a player to track their scores over time. At the beginning of each hole the player is informed of wind conditions, and whether the course is wet or dry, and the condition of the greens. The player uses text control to set which club and the power they wish to use. They then set the angle of their shot, and hit the ball. Putting consists of a close up view of the green. The player must avoid trees, water, and sand traps. The gain automatically keeps score.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Weiskopf", "publishers": "BCI Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83346-pro-golf\n"}
