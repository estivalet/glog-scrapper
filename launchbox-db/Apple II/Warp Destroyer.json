{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warp Destroyer", "overview": "Warp Destroyer is a space shooter for the Apple II. It is the year 3526, and your arch enemies the Zalbians have broken the Neutrality Pact of 3103. The Zalbians have seized 12 of your planets, and established military bases upon them. Your mission is to capture all 12 of these planetary systems by destroying the Zalbian base. Played from a first-person perspective, the player controls cross-hairs, and fires large purple bolts of energy at the enemy vehicles. At the beginning of each planet, the player flies through a warp zone, where they must keep their cross-hairs central on the screen, or else they will fly out of control and crash into the system's sun. Prior to each battle, the player is offered a graphical overview of their combatants. The player must quickly destroy the enemy vessels, or take damage from returning enemy fire. Ultimately, after destroying all resistance, the player destroys the enemy base, and must warp to the next planet. If the player takes too much damage, their ship is destroyed, and it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Varsanyi", "publishers": "Piccadilly Software Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ecRzuSFwY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83326-warp-destroyer\n"}
