{"altername_name": [], "name": "Building Perspective", "overview": "Building Perspective is a software program from Sunburst Communication that challenges students to view a group of colored buildings from ground level and then predict how those buildings would appear if viewed from above. Sounds simple, right? Well, it's not! Building Perspective is truly challenging for grade levels 2-6 as well as adults. The program focuses on four skills that integrate technology with mathematics. On the technology education side, the program helps students visualize how city blocks need to be planned in order for buildings to have natural light, heat, and space. Imagine working in a two-story building surrounded by skyscrapers where you can't see the sky unless you look straight up! Building Perspectives is a good starting point for designing a community and then building scale models. Students can learn how architects view structures from a \"birds-eye\" view. It is a tool that will help students develop visual thinking skills, spatial perception, and spatial reasoning. From the mathematics side, students scan for clues and hints as they view the target city from any of four sides that are given street names.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 28, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas C.
