{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flockland Island Crisis", "overview": "Flockland Island Crisis is a shoot 'em up where the player has to defend a long and narrow island which runs from the top to the bottom of the screen. On either side of the island are laser bases called oids (orbiting island defense systems) which can be moved up and down and shoot at the landgrabbers that move from the edges of the screen towards the island. The landgrabbers appear from both sides and both oids have to be controlled at the same time. If they manage to reach the island they will remove a piece of land and return to where they came from. Therefore it is necessary to shoot them down before they can do so. The game ends when the attackers have taken away five pieces of land.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 27, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Vital Information", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113888-flockland-island-crisis\n"}
