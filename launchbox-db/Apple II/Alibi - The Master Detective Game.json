{"altername_name": ["Alibi"], "name": "Alibi: The Master Detective Game", "overview": "Alibi is a text-based strategy game. The Colonel has been murdered, and you are the detective who must determine when, where, and who committed the crime. The player must individually interview a number of suspect. The player can ask where they think each suspect was at a particular time or who was in a specific room at a particular time. The player must look for discrepancies between the different character's stories to determine who, when, and where the crime took place. The player has an infinite number of tries to report the crime correctly, and receives a final score based upon number of clues asked, number of times looking at notebook, and number of attempts to get the case correct. There are 6 difficulty ranges from Constable to Chief Superintendent, which effect the number of suspects and the times in which the crime could have been committed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian L.
