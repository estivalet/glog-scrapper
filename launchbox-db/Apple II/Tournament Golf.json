{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tournament Golf", "overview": "1 - 4 opponents compete over two 18-hole golf courses. Players can choose from 14 different clubs, and control their swing allowing hooks and slices. Wind factors into shots, and courses have greens, trees, roughs, sand traps, and water hazards, which effect shots. There are two separate views: the fairway display which shows an overhead view of the course and the player swinging the club, and the putting display which shows a break indicator, high and low levels of the putting display, and location of ball, hole, and fringe. A scorecard is displayed after each hole and at the end of each round.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "Avalon Hill", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371926-tournament-golf\n"}
