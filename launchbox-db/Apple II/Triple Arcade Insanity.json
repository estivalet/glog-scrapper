{"altername_name": [], "name": "Triple Arcade Insanity", "overview": "Triple Arcade Insanity is a series of three similar space-themed arcade games created using Br\u00f8derbund Software's The Arcade Machine All three games involve flying a spaceship, and shooting a number of incoming alien vessels, which transform into a variety of strange shapes before being destroyed by your cannon fire. In all challenges, the player starts with 3 lives, but can gain extra ships as they advance in points. The three games are: Alien Onslaught - Where the player controls a spaceship which can scroll left and right on the bottom of the screen. The player must fire vertically at the aliens as they invade from the top of the screen and fire upon the player. The player advances to the next level by destroying all creatures on the screen. Galactic Conquerors - Virtually identical to the previous game, except this time aliens will scroll vertically towards the player, and after falling off the bottom of the screen, will appear once again at the top, as they approach the player. Andromeda Blitz - This time the player's spaceship is sandwiched between enemy craft on the top and bottom of the screen. The player can once again scroll left to right, but can fire up or down to destroy alien vessels. The player must avoid retaliatory fire from both sides.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brad Rosen", "publishers": "Avant-Garde Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74676-triple-arcade-insanity\n"}
