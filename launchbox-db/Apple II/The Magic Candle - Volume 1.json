{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Magic Candle: Volume 1", "overview": "The Magic Candle is a role-playing video game designed by Ali Atabek and developed and published by Mindcraft in 1989. In the game, players must assemble a group of six adventurers and journey across the kingdom of Deruvia to keep the demon Dreax imprisoned in the eponymous magic candle, which has begun to melt. The game's world includes several towns and cities, two castles, and several dungeons and towers. Unlike many computer games, one wins not by defeating a final enemy, but by collecting the necessary items and learning the necessary chants in order to preserve the magic candle. Players begin with one adventurer, a human hero called Lukas. Additional adventurers can be found in the game's two castles. Much of The Magic Candle's fun derives from discovering exactly what is needed to preserve the eponymous candle.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 23, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mindcraft", "publishers": "Mindcraft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85284-the-magic-candle-volume-1\n"}
