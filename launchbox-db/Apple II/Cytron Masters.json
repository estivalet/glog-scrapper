Cytron Masters is one of the earliest computer games that can be considered a real-time strategy game,or rather a real-time tactics predecessor to the genre, requiring the players to build up their forces in order to win. In the game each player takes the role of the commander, represented on-screen in Command Centers located on opposite sides of the screen. Scattered around the screen are eight \"generators\" that produce energy. The energy produced by these generators is the resource in the game, similar in function to the more tangible resources gathered in modern RTS games. Energy can then be \"spent\" to produce the Cytrons, robot warriors, as well as using it to move them about, fire, and other duties.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 5, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytron_Masters", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84547-cytron-masters\n"}
