The player can shoot forwards to destroy aliens, and can shoot vertically to destroy birds. A large flapping bird in the middle of the screen with intermittently swoop towards the player. Vertical shots will fall back to the ground if they do not connect with a monster, allowing the player to shoot themselves. When the player is shot, the vehicle will catch on fire and move to the center of the screen, and the driver will fall out. An ambulance will then drive to the center of the screen to pick up the driver. The player has 3 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 22, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gebelli Software", "publishers": "Gebelli Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113805-eggs-it\n"}
