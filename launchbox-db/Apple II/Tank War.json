{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tank War", "overview": "A game of tank combat between two human players, akin to Atari's Combat or to Desert Fox on the Channel F: each side selects one of four tank models, then picks a size and a color, and the ensuing battle is seen from an overhead view. There are no barriers other than the arena walls, and turning is the only movement control - forward thrust is automatic. Each tank has two types of attack, a slow projectile (the default weapon) and a faster one (which may only be fired while the first type is en route). Hits add to the target's damage counter, though the tanks continuously repair themselves when left unmolested; to score a point, the opponent's tank must be annihilated by inflicting 99 damage points. Shooting tends to heat up your gun turret, so it may be necessary to cool off after particularly enthusiastic bouts of firing.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "December 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Muse Software", "publishers": "Muse Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112572-tank-war\n"}
