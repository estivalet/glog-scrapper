{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lane Mastodon vs. the Blubbermen", "overview": "The year is 2029 and the evil Blubbermen have invaded earth. Only heroic Lane Mastodon can stop them, in a setting resembling science-fiction of the 1950's. Lane Mastodon vs. the Blubbermen is, along with Gamma Force in Pit of a Thousand Screams and the two ZorkQuest games, a part of the so-called InfoComics. The gameplay follows the same system as in the other games: the player reads text and views comic book panels (presented with CGA graphics in a vector format, including automatic zooming, panning, and rotating), occasionally being prompted to make a decision, thus leading the story into a different direction.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 27, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Snyder Productions", "publishers": "Infocom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96168-lane-mastodon-vs-the-blubbermen\n"}
