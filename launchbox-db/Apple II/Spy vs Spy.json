{"altername_name": ["Spy Vs Spy"], "name": "Spy vs Spy", "overview": "Spy vs. Spy was a game first published by First Star Software in 1984 for the Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64 and Apple II computers. It was a two-player, split-screen game, based on MAD Magazine's long running cartoon strip, Spy vs. Spy, about the slapstick antics of two spies trying to kill each other with improbably complex and elaborate traps and weapons. It was later ported to a much wider range of platforms including the ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron, Atari ST, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, MSX, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Master System, Game Boy, Xbox, Game Boy Color and Nintendo Entertainment System, which was emulated on the Game Boy Advance. A remake with a retro version was also released on iOS in 2012.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 10, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Star Software", "publishers": "First Star Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy_(1984_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477zE9xIOnw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86303-spy-vs-spy\n"}
