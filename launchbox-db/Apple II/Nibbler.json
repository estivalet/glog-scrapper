{"altername_name": ["Rock-Ola's Nibbler"], "name": "Nibbler", "overview": "Nibbler is an arcade game released in 1982 by Chicago-based developer Rock-Ola, in which players navigate a long snake through an enclosed maze consuming food along the way, while the length of the snake increases with each object consumed. Home versions were produced in 1983 by Datasoft for the Atari 8-bit and the Apple II. The game gained fame for becoming the first to include a nine-digit scoring system that enabled players to surpass one billion points during gameplay, which sparked numerous attempts to set high-score records in competitive play over the course of several decades, in turn inspiring the 2016 award-winning documentary Man vs. Snake: The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 25, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rock-Ola", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbler_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_bRDH6Mo14", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85374-nibbler\n"}
