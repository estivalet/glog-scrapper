{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dark Forest", "overview": "A strategy/war game where you must defeat your opponents and take over their territories. You select one of four territories to play as and up to 6 players can play. The 'Gruds' play the remaining teams. The game takes place on an overhead map of the land, with each country's territories color-coded. Each turn you get more men, move them from territory to territory, and fight to take over new territories. The goal is of course to defeat all your opponents and the Gruds, and own the entire land.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 7, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84597-dark-forest\n"}
