{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lancaster", "overview": "The arcade shooter Lancaster is the first game by Will Harvey. The player controls a starship on the static screen. The mustached faces flying over the starship blow up balloons bouncing from bricks situated below. The player's goal is to shoot the faces and balloons. The balloons knock out the bricks of the same color and hatch into three more faces if were shot enough. Clearing the screen of faces and balloons moves the player to the next level. High scores are stored in a top 8 table.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 19, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harvey Video Games", "publishers": "Silicon Valley Systems", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmSxvc9XqAw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85154-lancaster\n"}
