{"altername_name": [], "name": "Run Your Own Train", "overview": "Run Your Own Train is a model railroad construction program. The player can create their own model railway system by laying out tracks, signals, switches. The background can then be enhanced with buildings, rivers, and mountains. The player can then simulate up to 4 trains of various length, speed, and direction driving on their model railroad. The player must control switches to avoid trains crashing. There is also the option for a player to control their own train on the custom track, as they drive from a 1st-person perspective. The player must avoid crashing into other trains in the system, and can control their movements by setting switches and speeds.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Abracadata Ltd.", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372179-run-your-own-train\n"}
