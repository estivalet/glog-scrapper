{"altername_name": ["Ralph Bosson's High Seas"], "name": "High Seas", "overview": "From the days of fighting sail comes this game of combat on the high seas. Although produced very early in the PC era (1988), Ralph Bosson's High Seas works from a graphical deck view, resorting to a chart view only for position checks (which can become important in fleet engagements). It operates either on 10-game-minute turns, or interrupt-to-issue-orders mode. It models the effects of wind on maneuvering and the effects of different ammo types against the wooden walls and sails of opposing vessels. A very advanced feature included is a scenario designer. The game can be played either hot-seated or with a computer opponent.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 26, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gard\u00e9 Games of Distinction", "publishers": "Gard\u00e9 Games of Distinction", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114923-high-seas\n"}
