{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tempete sur les Bermudes", "overview": "Your strong taste for adventure and sardines in oil led you to participate in the solo deckchair. Everything is bathed in plankton, until this day when an unexpected and sneaky storm surprises you from behind, the traitor. Before you can even say \"unconstitutionally\", a blade is sweeping your deck. Lack of pot, it's just the moment you are there! In the next minute you lose consciousness, your boat, your balance and your head. But Neptune is a nice god and rather than renewing the coup of the Rainbow Warrior, he drops you groggy (software) on a deserted beach. When you open an eye clouded with algae, you see that you are on an island. Your boat ran aground not far from there. Do not panic. It is a question of repairing as quickly as possible so that we can start again. It's your turn ! Adventure game entirely in French and in colors made by Christophe Bourrier. The cover design is by Jean Sol\u00e9, the graphics by Philippe Bousquet.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Froggy Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125964-tempete-sur-les-bermudes\n"}
