{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magical Myths", "overview": "Magical Myths is an educational game that teaches Greek mythology. It consists of three different stories: The Greek Gods, Pandora's Box and King Midas. Each one consists of text accompanied with images, including some that are animated. The stories themselves are not interactive more than pressing a button to progress. After finished reading a story the player is asked to answer some questions. These can be based on either reading skills or vocabulary building. There are different question formats: multiple choice or fill-in the blanks for reading questions and fill-in, synonyms or antonyms for vocabulary questions. The program comes with an editor called myth maker that allows the user to create new stories as well as accompanying questions with answers. There is also a mythical match game which is a concentration game where the players have to flip cards to reveal pictures with the aim of uncovering all the images.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Unicorn Educational Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115353-magical-myths\n"}
