{"altername_name": ["Maces & Magic #1: Balrog", "Balrog Sampler"], "name": "Balrog", "overview": "An extremely hard to find game. It is a fantasy adventure where you can create your own characters, choose from a wide inventory of weapons and armor, and use freeform input combined with making choices to explore a dungeon. Watch out for the Chromatic Dragon! This is a dungeon crawl game - equip your character, enter the dungeon, fight monsters and win treasure; traps abound as well. Many events are random. You can save your character (assuming he survives) to use in later episodes. Balrog was a 'sampler' of the Maces and Magic series, with only the later ones being full games.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chameleon Software", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/374013-balrog\n"}
