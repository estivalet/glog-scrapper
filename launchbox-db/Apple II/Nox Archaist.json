{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nox Archaist", "overview": "An 8-bit RPG modeled after the iconic games of the 1980s. You control a party of adventurers who travel the Realm, talk to NPCs in towns and castles, explore dungeons, and fight monsters as you seek to save the world from a terrible danger. Nox Archaist is a new RPG for the classic Apple II platform, playable on Apple II hardware, and emulation. It is an evolution of the classic fantasy games of the 1980s like Ultima, Bards Tale, and Wizardry. Nox Archaist is set in a sinister world ruled by sorcery and swords. Adventurers brave enough to explore Nox Archaist will encounter engaging NPCs and a vast storyline within a non-linear world. Hordes of vile enemies will block your path to fame and riches. Gamers will enjoy features like skills-driven character development and strategic turn-based combat scenarios which integrate with the game's storyline and push the boundaries of the Apple II platform.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "December 12, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "6502 Workshop", "publishers": "6502 Workshop", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeElb-5o94A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152555-nox-archaist\n"}
