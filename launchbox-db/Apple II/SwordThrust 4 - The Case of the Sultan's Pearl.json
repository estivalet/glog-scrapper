{"altername_name": [], "name": "SwordThrust 4: The Case of the Sultan's Pearl", "overview": "Twelve centuries ago, King Drugia was mocking the young muslem that he had invited for supper. \"You have as much chance of ruling the island as I have of finding a pearl in this oyster!\" The King laughed, swallowed the oyster whole, and promptly choked to death. During the autopsy, one large white pearl was found in his throat. The pearl soon became the symbol of the favour of Allah, and every year a solemn ceremony grants the power of the sultanship to whoever holds the pearl. Many years ago you had made friends with Shadom gen-Harouk, the current sultan, and so you were invited to the ceremony. You went, expecting a pleasant vacation. A few hours before the ceremony, you were awakened from your sleep. One of the Sultan's guards had been murdered, and the pearl was missing! You must find the murderer and recover the pearl or else the sultanship is lost!", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 12, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ace Software", "publishers": "Ace Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116267-swordthrust-4-the-case-of-the-sultans-pearl\n"}
