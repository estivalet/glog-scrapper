{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jungle Hunt", "overview": "Jungle Hunt is a right-to-left side-scrolling arcade game produced and released by Taito in 1982. It was initially released as Jungle King. Jungle Hunt is one of the first video games to use parallax scrolling. The player controls an unnamed explorer, sporting a pith helmet and safari suit, attempting to rescue his girl from a tribe of cannibals by swinging from vine to vine, swimming a crocodile-infested river, and avoiding rolling rocks. Taito released a re-skinned version of the game as Pirate Pete. Atari published home ports under their own brand for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 8-bit family. The rest were released under the Atarisoft label: Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC (as a PC booter), and TI-99/4A. It was re-released, via emulation, as part of Taito Legends for Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. In the Atari-ported versions the hero is named Sir Dudley, and the girl, married to Sir Dudley, is Lady Penelope.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito America", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Hunt", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlBjJ5AHIwU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82098-jungle-hunt\n"}
