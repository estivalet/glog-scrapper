{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mars Cars", "overview": "Mars Cars is a maze game in which players must navigate their little hatchback car through a maze. The goal is to collect the Martian treasures and then exit the maze through the warp door. Hindering your progress are four types of Martians: Clutz, Fire Bug, Hatcher and Kamikaze. Your enemies cannot pass through the maze walls but your car will destroy every wall it touches. The game strategy then becomes a balance between figuring out which walls to destroy in order to minimize the reach of the monsters and finding the quickest route to the treasures.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datamost", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Cars", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115015-mars-cars\n"}
