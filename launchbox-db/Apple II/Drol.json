{"altername_name": ["\u5c0f\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba"], "name": "Drol", "overview": "Drol is a platform game where you play a cute robot that can fly and shoot. Your goal is to rescue children that are wandering around each level. The levels consist of rows of platforms, with gaps which can be jumped through to go up or down a vertical level. The creatures to avoid and shoot vary from strange hopping, beer-belly aliens, to demons, snakes, and axes flying through the air (we never do find out who's throwing those axes!). Like Defender, Drol incorporates a \"radar\" at the top of the screen, so you can find the children and dodge incoming baddies.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Benny Aik Beng Ngo", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drol", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQMX9ZDJc7Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83913-drol\n"}
