It was released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II. The game focused on both the material and economic challenges of building a permanent, fully functioning space station in geocentric orbit. The game was set in 1996, and the player was given various selected scenarios to fulfill, from mundane tasks such as setting up a simple space station to developing and supplying a specified amount of high-grade, zero G pharmaceuticals to being the first to contact alien life. The game also was a cut-throat strategy game in multiplayer, as players competed over finite resources and resource management.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 29, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Orbit_Stations", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83917-eos-earth-orbit-stations\n"}
