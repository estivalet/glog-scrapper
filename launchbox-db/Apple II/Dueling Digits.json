{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dueling Digits", "overview": "Dueling Digits is a 1 - 2 player competitive math game for the Apple II. It's a dark age. The art and science of math is all but lost. You battle the forces of ignorance (or dangerous human opponents) to capture glowing \"sacred\" numbers and fit them into the \"Expression\". The player controls a small laser along the lateral and lower part of the gameplay window. The player has a laser, which can shoot numbers and symbols, and these can be deposited on the expression window at the bottom half of the screen. If the player makes a correct math expression, they are awarded points. The player is also awarded points for shooting the opposing player. Each player has 10 lives, and when one player loses all of their lives, it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Couch", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154197-dueling-digits\n"}
