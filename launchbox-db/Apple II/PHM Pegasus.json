{"altername_name": [], "name": "PHM Pegasus", "overview": "PHM Pegasus assigns the player to the control of three different types of vehicles: Patrol Hydrofoil Missilecrafts (PHM), Seasprite and Seahawk helicopters, and convoy ships. Some of the missions include destroying all enemy vessels in a given area, surveillance requiring you to identify the location of enemy ships (without sinking them!), or to escort a supply ship through hostile territory. As missions are successfully completed you earn points based on how successful the mission was, and with increasing points you can advance in rank, from deck mopper up to admiral.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 6, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lucasfilm Games", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHM_Pegasus", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83409-phm-pegasus\n"}
