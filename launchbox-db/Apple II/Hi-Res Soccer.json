{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hi-Res Soccer", "overview": "Hi-Res Soccer is an early attempt at recreating the European football sport on a computer. It allows the player to compete in single real-time matches against either another human or against an AI player. The matches are between a green and a purple team who each have eight players on the pitch which are controlled with paddles to pass, dribble and shoot. The names of the teams can be entered by the player. Before starting out the length of a game can be selected from one to 45 minutes per half. There are three different skill levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. They differ in how the side lines work. In the beginner mode the ball bounces off the sidelines like in an indoor game, while in intermediate it only goes out of play behind the goals and in advanced it can go out on any side.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "On-Line Systems", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372700-hi-res-soccer\n"}
