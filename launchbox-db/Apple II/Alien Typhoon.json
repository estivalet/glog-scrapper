{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Typhoon", "overview": "Alien Typhoon is an enhanced version of Apple Galaxian (Alien Rain),with more aliens on screen. In essence it is a variant of the arcade game Galaxian. It is a shoot-'em-up where a formation of alien ships attack your lone starship at the bottom of the screen. The aliens peel off from the formation and attack you in different patterns, depending on the color of the ship. The two ships at the top are the motherships and they bring an escort of two red aliens with them to guard them, but if you can shoot the escort and then the mothership, you'll score lots of points.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starcraft", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1yaRpPt1E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82628-alien-typhoon\n"}
