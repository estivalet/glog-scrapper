{"altername_name": [], "name": "Phaser Fire", "overview": "Phaser Fire is space-themed arcade game for the Apple II. Game play is in two phases. During the first phase, the player must strafe left and right, to shoot down incoming alien vessels. The alien ships will fire vertically and diagonally, and the player must avoid incoming fire and encroaching meteorites. A scanner in the top left corner of the screen shows how many vessels remain in that phase. In the second phase, the player must maneuver their vessel through a tunnel with multiple barricades. Electric bolts will intermittently streak across the screen, and the player must pass through spaces without being hit. The player can strafe left and right, and can also choose to temporarily halt their forward momentum. After completing a tunnel, the player returns again to shooting enemy vessels. The player has 3 ships, and when all are lost, it is game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Salt City Software", "publishers": "Gebelli Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368194-phaser-fire\n"}
