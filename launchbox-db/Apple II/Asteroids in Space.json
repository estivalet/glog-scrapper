{"altername_name": ["Meteoroids in Space"], "name": "Asteroids in Space", "overview": "Asteroids in Space is a variant of Asteroids with the same set of features as the original arcade game. The player starts out in the middle of the screen surrounded by asteroids that fly by and has to use paddles to shoot, thrust and turn. As the asteroids get shot they split into smaller ones before they are fully destroyed. The player has five lives and one is lost for every contact with an asteroid but an extra is awarded when reaching 10,000 points. The alien ships from the arcade game exist in this version too. Before starting a game it's possible to choose the speed of lasers and asteroids (normal or fast). There is also an option to run a demo mode.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 28, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bruce Wallace", "publishers": "Quality Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87694-asteroids-in-space\n"}
