{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mutant (Universal Software)", "overview": "Mutant is a Pac-Man clone. The player controls a mutant creature whom can move in 4 cardinal directions in a maze. The goal is to eat all dots on the screen while attempting to avoid enemy monsters which come out of their home base and move randomly about. There are moving platforms which occasionally change the shape of the map. If the player moves past a glowing square, the enemies become temporarily vulnerable, and the player can shoot bullets for a short period. When the player collects all dots, they move onto a more challenging level. The player starts with 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over. The player loses a life if they come in contact with an enemy creature while not vulnerable.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Waldo", "publishers": "Universal Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147313-mutant-universal-software\n"}
