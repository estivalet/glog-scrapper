{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bats in the Belfry", "overview": "Bats have invaded an old house, and your job is to grab them in your net, and either move them to the houses's belfry or throw them out an open window. The player controls a small character who can climb up and down stairs, jump, and grab bats in their net. When a player grabs a bat, they have a limited period of time before the bat escapes their net. The bat can either be released at one of the randomly opening house windows, or can be released up in the attic, where the bat will take residence in the belfry. The player gains points for every bat moved to the belfry. There is never more than one bad present on the screen at a time. The player must avoid poisonous spiders which hang from the ceiling, and intermittently move across the floor. The player can squash the spiders by jumping on them, but if they are not careful they will take a bite. 10 spider bites, and the player passes out, and it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Samuel Moore", "publishers": "American Eagle Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YeWS2rRsVY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113929-bats-in-the-belfry\n"}
