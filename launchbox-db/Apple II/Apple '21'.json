{"altername_name": ["Apple 21"], "name": "Apple '21'", "overview": "Apple '21' is a digital adaptation of a Las Vegas Blackjack game. Up to three player can play at the same time and challenge the dealer. A game starts with each player being offered a loan with the maximum value being $1000. The players then get to choose an amount to bet for before the cards are being dealt. The loan offer will reappear any time a player runs out of funds and a player can quit the game by rejecting the offer. Once cards have been dealt a player can choose one of four options by entering the corresponding number on the keyboard: hit, stand, double or split. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 without getting busted by going over. Players can leave and new ones can join at any time during the game.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softape", "publishers": "Softape", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113883-apple-21\n"}
