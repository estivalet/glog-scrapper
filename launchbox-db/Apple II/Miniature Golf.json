{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miniature Golf", "overview": "A BASIC adaptation of miniature golf for 1 to 10 human players, courtesy of SoftSide magazine. 9 holes are played in sequence, with a top-down view of the course, and each player in turn attempts to complete a hole. A shot is performed by positioning the putter at an angle and selecting a swing force from 1 to 9; each hole has a pre-determined par - the player's number of strokes minus the par determines the score, so (as in standard golf) lower scores are better.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 24, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoftSide Magazine", "publishers": "SoftSide Magazine", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85333-miniature-golf\n"}
