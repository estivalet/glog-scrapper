What makes STAR MAZE so different? A combination of special features. Like fantastic graphics. Full-screen , multidirectional scrolling . Brilliant colors. And much more. STAR MAZE is indeed a maze - a 16-level labyrinth of temptation and danger. Your mission ... to locate nine power jewels in each level and deliver them to the mothership before you get destroyed by aliens or run out of fuel. Only a small part of the maze is visible at one time. Space - and the maze - appear to move around you, which allows for easier tracking of your explorer ship .Fortress-like maze walls and a multitude of objects in the wide game passageways fill your screen display in 16 dazzling colors (most games have only 6). And although STAR MAZE is a cinch to learn, its big game features will give you much to think about. You and your family will spend months investigating the unknown corners of this cleverly conceived and highly entertaining universe. Never has space appeared so vast, so beautiful, so deep.\"", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 11, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eastman Computing, Inc", "publishers": "Sir-tech Software, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86331-star-maze\n"}
