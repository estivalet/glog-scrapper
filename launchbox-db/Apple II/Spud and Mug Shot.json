{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spud and Mug Shot", "overview": "Spud and Mug Shot are a series of two arcade games for the Apple II. Spud is a 2-player combat game, where each player controls a turret that can rotate 360 degrees and fire. Each turret is surrounded by a shield on 3 sides with 3 openings. Moving on the screen are 3 bouncy balls and a large central circle. Each player tries to shoot their opponent while the obstacles and shields get in their way. Each game lasts 500 time segments, or until their opponent is destroyed by losing 300 health segments. Intermittently a green border will show up in the middle of the screen, which keeps the circle on that player's side of the screen. Mug Shot is an 1-4 player game where players take turns. The player once again controls a turret, but this time shoots at bouncing objects on the left side of the screen. When an object is shot it moves over to the left of the screen. If one of the objects bounces through a crack in the player's shield, it is game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stephen Walloch", "publishers": "Howard W.
