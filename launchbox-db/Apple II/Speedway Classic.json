{"altername_name": [], "name": "Speedway Classic", "overview": "The player controls a vehicle reminiscent of Formula 1 cars, with the goal of maximizing score by attempting to finish first on a short race track. Played from a perspective behind the vehicle, the player can move left, right, or straighten their car. There are 4 difficulty levels, which determine the number of laps, the speed of opponent cars, and the presence of oil slicks. If the player strikes hard behind another vehicle, they explode, but if they bump the side, they spark, and are tossed to the side of the screen. At the end of each race, the player is rewarded a score for their time and position, but are docked points for touching the edge of the track, sparking with other vehicles, spinouts, and fire collisions.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Norm Gray", "publishers": "Actioncraft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W9rFtmZi0I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151370-speedway-classic\n"}
