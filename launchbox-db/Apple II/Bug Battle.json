{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bug Battle", "overview": "Bug Battle is a Centipede variant where the player has to defend a prize winning garden that has been infested by pests. Like in the arcade game the bugs move row by row down towards the player who can move around in the lower quarter of the screen. Additionally the player has to deal with a jealous neighbour who is seeding the garden with 'Amazon Skram weed' which work just like the mushrooms in Centipede, hiding the bugs from view. There is also the spider which attack the player from the bottom of the screen. After clearing out all bugs another wave will appear from the top. Making contact with any of the enemies leads to a life being lost.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 21, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael J.
