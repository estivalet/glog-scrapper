{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pyramid", "overview": "Pyramid is a multiplayer puzzle game. The goal is to fill your side of the pyramid with english words before your opponent. Pyramid is a 2-player word-forming game for the Apple II. A set of 7 letters scroll across the bottom of the screen, and the letters are given the same point value as found in the board game Scrabble. Either player can opt to take letters at any time, if they like the letters that scroll by. If the other player decides they would rather have the letters, they can take them for progressively more points per time, at 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 points loss. Each player's goal is to make a single 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 letter word, and each player can take or discard letters until they have the ones they wish to make their words. The game continues until one player has completed their half of the pyramid, and the final score is tabulated. The game keeps a running tally of each player's highest scores and the number of games they have played.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gabor Laufer", "publishers": "Unusual Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166316-pyramid\n"}
