{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yahtzee", "overview": "Yahtzee is a text-based implementation of the popular dice game for the Apple II. Players take turns rolling five dice, and the player can reroll any or all of the dice twice more before selecting their scoring category. Scoring categories include 6 categories within the Upper Section, which include the sum of all ones to sixes. If the sum of the upper category is 63 points or more, the player receives a 35 point bonus. In the Lower Section, the categories include 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, full house, a 4 dice straight, a 5 dice straight, yahtzee (5 of a kind) and chance (which is the sum of all dice). A game is finished when all 11 scoring categories have been used. A computer opponent is available for competition.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 13, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary A.
