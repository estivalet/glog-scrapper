{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zorro", "overview": "This computer game version of the Legend of Zorro was not well received by reviewers or gamers upon its release in 1985. Unfortunately due to some rather obscure puzzles and at times, tedious and repetitive game play, it made the game less appealing than Bruce Lee. For all its faults and there are many, with a little perseverance, it can be an enjoyable and rewarding arcade adventure, with some charming moments, like the branding of the bull with the iron and catapulting into the air via a conveniently left spring board and a dazed Garcia guard", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datasoft", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro_(1985_video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ssOMXwUXxPg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82248-zorro\n"}
