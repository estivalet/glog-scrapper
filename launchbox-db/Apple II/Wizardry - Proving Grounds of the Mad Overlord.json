It was developed by Andrew Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. In 1980, Norman Sirotek formed Sir-Tech Software, Inc. and launched a Beta version of the product at the 1980 Boston Computer Convention. The final version of the game was released in 1981. The game was one of the first Dungeons & Dragons-style role-playing games to be written for computer play, and the first such game to offer color graphics. It was also the first true party-based role-playing video game. The game eventually ended up as the first of a trilogy that also included Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds and Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn. Proving Grounds needs to be completed in order to create a party that could play in the remainder of the trilogy.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 13, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sir-Tech Software", "publishers": "Sir-Tech Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iOZzwIlMA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86486-wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord\n"}
