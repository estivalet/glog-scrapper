{"altername_name": [], "name": "Apple-Oids", "overview": "Apple-Oids is a clone of Asteroids for the Apple II. Instead of shooting asteroids, the player controls a spaceship which shoots marauding apples. The game starts with a spaceship in the middle of the screen which can be moved or rotated to fire upon apple-shaped asteroids. Initially, there are a number of large apples on the screen, but as the player shoots a large apple, it breaks into 2 medium-sized apples. The medium-sized apples will break into 2 smaller apples when shot, and the small apples will be entirely destroyed when shot. The player beats a stage by destroying all the initial apples. There are successively more apples on each stage. The player can randomly teleport about the screen by entering hyperspace, but they risk placing themselves in the way of an encroaching apple. Intermittently, an alien saucer will enter the screen, which the player can fire upon. The player starts with a total of 3 ships. If they are hit, they lose one ship. Large apples are worth 20 points, medium are 50, and small asteroids are worth 100 points. A large saucer nets 200 points while a small saucer nets 1000 points. The player gets an extra ship every 10,000 points. When the player is out of ships, it's game over. The asteroids in Apple-oids are in the shape of apples.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Luhrs", "publishers": "California Pacific Computer", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113894-apple-oids\n"}
