{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Lion's Share", "overview": "Welcome to the sixth century B.C. , and to the New Babylonian Empire. The City of Babylon has regained its once-lost splendor as the capital of a powerful nation. It is a city of surpassing beauty, but an eerie place as well. Especially eerie for you, because you are a Persian soldier with the objective of bringing this powerful giant to its knees! You are a special agent in the army of Cyrus the Persian. The City of Babylon is the Persians' next military target. But the Persians need to put someone inside the city who can signal them at the most advantageous moment for an attack. Your assignment is to get into the heavily-guarded city, a feat in itself, and then signal the Persians to attack at just the right moment. Supplies you need must be found on your way. Remember: the Babylonians are a shrewd and suspicious people and are quick to spot a foreigner. You 'll begin your approach to Babylon at a distance several miles from the city. If you're successful in your mission, your reward will be large and bountiful-the \"lion's share\" of a lifetime's worth of earnings! You can make your task easier by reading the first six chapters of the Book of Daniel (we'd suggest a modern translation). However, this is not absolutely necessary.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 12, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Davka Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116271-the-lions-share\n"}
