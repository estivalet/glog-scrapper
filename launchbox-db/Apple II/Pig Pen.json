{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pig Pen", "overview": "In Pig Pen, the player is a farmer attempting to lay out a field of corn in a maze. In the center of the screen is the eponymous group of pigs. The pigs will escape from the central pen, and run randomly throughout the maze. If the player comes in contact with the pigs, they will lose a life. Lose 3 lives, and it's game over. If the player lays corn down in all corners of the field, they will advance to the next stage. On the main menu, the player can choose the number of pigs they must avoid. Players receives more points per stage if they are avoiding a larger number of pigs. In each of the 4 corners, there is a power-up, which will temporarily turn the pigs timid. If the player touches one of the pigs in this state, they will turn into bacon, and return to the pig pen to come back to life. During each stage, vegetables will appear, which the player can collect for bonus points", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TMQ Software", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113830-pig-pen\n"}
