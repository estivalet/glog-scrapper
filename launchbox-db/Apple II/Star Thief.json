{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Thief", "overview": "Star Thief is 1-player or 2-player co-op space-themed arcade game for the Apple II. The player controls a small arrow-shaped spaceship, which is controlled via rotation and thrust. It is capable of firing a small beam weapon from the anterior portion of the ship. The player's goal is to protect the 8 pods which are present in the middle of the screen. Alien vessels will either try to attack and distract the player, or will attempt to grab the pods and pull them off the screen. Often the alien ships will word in tandem. If an alien ship grabs a pod, if the ship can be destroyed before leaving the screen, the pod can be recovered. The player has infinite ships, but it is game over when all 8 pods are destroyed. The player is awarded points for the number of alien vessels which are destroyed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 11, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cavalier Computer", "publishers": "Cavalier Computer", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86333-star-thief\n"}
