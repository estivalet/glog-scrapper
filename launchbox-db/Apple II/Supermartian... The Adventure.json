{"altername_name": [], "name": "Supermartian... The Adventure", "overview": "Supermartian came to Earth in an effort to escape the hostilities which were ravaging his home planet of Mars. His Martian name is unpronounceable by human tongues, yet the letters on his suit resemble the English letters \" M \" and \" S,\" in that order. He never bothered to change the order of the letters to fit his earth name, \" Supermartian.\" The first creature Supermartian met upon his arrival to earth was a stray mutt called Topps. You are the first human that Supermartian has really taken an interest in. In fact, you are the most intelligent creature he has met on Earth. One day, Topps wandered away and became lost. Supermartian asked you to accompany him on a journey to find the lost dog. Your search leads to a small town. While looking for Topps, you should be constantly on the lookout for other problems which might need Supermartian's attention.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 12, 1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Computer Easy", "publishers": "Computer Easy", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116275-supermartian-the-adventure\n"}
