{"altername_name": [], "name": "Autobahn", "overview": "A clone of the arcade game Monaco GP, Autobahn (by the legendary Nasir Gebelli) is a very simple and fast arcade racer. As you blaze down the roadway you must avoid colliding with other cars and road hazards. You have three speeds you can run your car at and the high score is determined by the number of miles you've driven. The perspective is a top-down view of your car, the road and the other cars coming down from the top of the screen toward the bottom. The left and right arrows will move your car around and hopefully out of the way of the approaching hazards. The spacebar stops your 'drift' and the 1, 2, 3 keys change your speed. Unfortunately, the high score list is not saved. You have three cars to demolish before the game is over. This game is best played with a paddle (press Ctrl+P while playing to change to paddles).", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30f1KOmzJ4g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96078-autobahn\n"}
