{"altername_name": [], "name": "Both Barrels", "overview": "Both Barrels contains two shooting games: High Noon and Duck Hunt. High Noon is set in the old west and involves a shootout outside a saloon. Enemies will pop out from covers, doors and windows and the player simply has to shoot them before they shoot. The player is equipped with two revolvers and each is aimed and shoot individually using paddles. Duck Hunt is a two player game that is played with just a single button. It's viewed from the side where the shooters are located on the ground while ducks fly across the screen above them. Each shooter fires from its own angle and all the player has to do is time the shot. The player with most hits after ten rounds wins the game.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng6iH7cd8Ss", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84032-both-barrels\n"}
