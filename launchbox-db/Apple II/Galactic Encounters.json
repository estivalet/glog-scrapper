{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galactic Encounters", "overview": "Galactic Encounters is a compilation of two space-themed games for the Apple II. Space Maze (called star chase on the box) is a one player arcade racing game similar to games like Head-On, featuring two vehicles travelling in opposite directions on a circular track. The goal is to collect as many pellets as possible without coming in contact with the opponent vehicle. The player can speed up or slow down their ship, and can change lanes to inner and outer lanes to attempt to avoid the oncoming vessel. The opposing vessel will always move one lane towards the player at each opportunity. If the player is hit, it's game over. Three difficulty levels are available. Star Trek Adventure is a 1-player Star Trek game. The player has one month to destroy all Klingon vessels before they invade Federation space. The player must explore an 8 x 8 galactic map, by using their long-range sensors to find Klingon vessels. When in the same quadrant as an enemy vessel, the player must control their phasers, photon torpedoes, and shield power to destroy enemy vessels. The player must enact repairs to their vessel between battles.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Green Valley Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167663-galactic-encounters\n"}
