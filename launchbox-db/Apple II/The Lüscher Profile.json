{"altername_name": ["The Luscher Profile"], "name": "The L\u00fcscher Profile", "overview": "The L\u00fcscher Profile lets you look into your mind and personality by analyzing your preferences for various colors, shades, and shapes. By recording and interpreting your responses to a variety of tests, a profile emerges of the factors which define your current approach to work, to relationships, and to life in general. Although there has been a short form of the test available for several years, the advent of the microcomputer makes Dr. Luscher's revised, longer test available for the first time. This combination of modern technology with a time-tested psychological tool helps you understand the one person most important to you: Yourself. It's a program you'll want to share with your friends and come back to often.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 14, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113934-the-luscher-profile\n"}
