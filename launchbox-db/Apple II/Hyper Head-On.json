{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hyper Head-On", "overview": "Hyper Head-on is a one player arcade racing game featuring two vehicles travelling in opposite directions on a circular track. The goal is to collect as many pellets as possible without coming in contact with the opponent vehicle. The opponent vehicle will always try to change lane towards the player, and can move one lane per opening. The player can change two lanes per opening, and must outmaneuver their opponent. Because shorter inside lanes take less time to traverse, the time between two vehicles passing remains variable. The player may choose the color of their car and that of their opponent, and there are 4 levels of gameplay difficulty available. The player collects pellets as they circle the track, earning 5 points per pellet. The player starts with 3 vehicles. It's game over when all 3 vehicles are destroyed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "StarCraft, Inc.", "publishers": "Broderbund Software, Inc.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372733-hyper-head-on\n"}
