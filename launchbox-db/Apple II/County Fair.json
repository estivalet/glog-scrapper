{"altername_name": ["County Carnival"], "name": "County Fair", "overview": "County Fair (also known as County Carnival) is a carnival game released for the Apple II. Nice large colourful sprites & good sounds get you into the game as you try to shoot down all the targets in the shooting gallery, which you have to do with ever decreasing ammo & a time limit. As well as the usual objects, you have to shoot coloured trees at the top of the screen, which seem to have replaced the spinning wheel with pipes in the normal versions. The controls allow you to use a joystick, which makes the game easy to use. There is also a hi score available to see what you need to beat.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 4, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datamost", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84362-county-fair\n"}
