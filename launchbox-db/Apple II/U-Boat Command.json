{"altername_name": [], "name": "U-Boat Command", "overview": "U-Boat Command is a game of submarine strategy for the Apple II. The goal is to invade the enemy seas and sink as many of their vessels as possible, with the primary goal to sink their prized carrier. Played from a first-person perspective, the player navigates via their periscope with the assistance of sonar and a compass. The player can dive beneath the waves to become unseen by enemy vessels, but must surface to launch torpedoes. Care must be taken not to dive too deep and strike the bottom of the ocean. The player can turn off their engines to remain silent beneath the waves, or use them to accelerate. The player encounters refueling subs to extend their journey, and can also target enemy airplanes, destroyers, and frigates for additional points. The player must contend with limited fuel, air, battery power, and torpedoes. Enemy vessels will target your sub if you venture too close, and the ship will take progressive damage if under attack.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Synergistic Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144377-u-boat-command\n"}
