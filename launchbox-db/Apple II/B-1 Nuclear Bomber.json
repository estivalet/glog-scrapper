{"altername_name": [], "name": "B-1 Nuclear Bomber", "overview": "B-1 Nuclear Bomber is a flight simulator game based on piloting a B-1 Lancer to its target and dropping a nuclear bomb. The USSR is one of the target countries. The game was developed by Avalon Hill and Microcomputer Games, Inc, and released in 1980 for the Apple II and other computers. The game box details a sample scenario set in the then-future of a bombing run over Moscow on July 1, 1991, which turned out to be just months before the official dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26 of that year. In March 1983 B-1 Nuclear Bomber tied for eighth place in Softline's Dog of the Year awards \"for badness in computer games\", Atari 8-bit division, based on reader submissions. A 1992 Computer Gaming World survey of wargames with modern settings gave the game zero stars out of five, stating that \"its play mechanics were embarrassing when it was initially released\"", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "January 6, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-1_Nuclear_Bomber", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84147-b-1-nuclear-bomber\n"}
