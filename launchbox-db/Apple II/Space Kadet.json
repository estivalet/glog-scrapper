{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Kadet", "overview": "The action in Space Cadette takes place in a tangle of corridors, where one or two 'cadettes' face off against swarms of alien pests (and in two-player mode, against each other). Each player serves everyone else fiery death, courtesy of a frontal torpedo; ammo is limited, but recharges with time. As they weave and wind through the maze, both players and enemies leave force shields behind them. Shields are color-keyed to their owners: purple for player 1, green for player 2, white for the aliens. Shots of the same color will pass through the shield, but those of the wrong color will explode on contact (and destroy the shield), meaning that players have to constantly replenish their defenses to survive. Enemy ships come in a variety of types, worth different amount of points when destroyed. Eliminate them all, and a new level begins - the speed picks up and the aliens get more lethal as the game progresses.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Funtastic, Inc.", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373922-space-kadet\n"}
