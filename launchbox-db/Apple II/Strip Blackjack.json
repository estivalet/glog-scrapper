Gameplay is a basic blackjack card game, where the player draws cards with the goal being to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If Chryl scores higher, she wins. The gender of the player determines which four pieces of clothing they have to take off. Chryl and the player each have four pieces of clothing, and the winner of each hand gets to put on an article of clothing, while the loser must remove one piece.
