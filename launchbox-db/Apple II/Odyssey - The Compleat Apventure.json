{"altername_name": [], "name": "Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure", "overview": "Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure was a videogame written by Robert Clardy and released by Synergistic Software in 1980. It was created for the Apple II platform and is considered one of the first microcomputer-based role-playing video games. The title was intentionally misspelled; Apventure is a reference to the Apple computer. A forerunner of Akalabeth and Ultima, Odyssey was a multi-part adventure game that placed the player in the role of the leader of an army who sets out to vanquish an evil wizard. Elements of Dungeons & Dragons can be found within the game, which combines elements of two earlier games written by Clardy: Dungeon Campaign and Wilderness Campaign.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 25, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergistic Software", "publishers": "Synergistic Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey:_The_Compleat_Apventure", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02CEI0WhAPM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85388-odyssey-the-compleat-apventure\n"}
