{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hadron", "overview": "Hadron is space based shoot 'em up game played from a first person perspective. The objective of the game is to follow enemy fighters back to their base and then destroy it. On the way there are numerous enemy space ships that the player can attempt to shoot down. Doing so reduces enemy flak which might prevent the player from reaching the base. Among the enemy ships there are different types of fighters, saucers, sensors and robots. Each ship has a specific target area that has to be hit such as the antenna of the surveillance ship. The player's ship has a limited amount of ammunition and fuel which decreases when steering or changing speeds. If successful in destroying the enemy base, the player's ship is refuelled and gets an ammunition refill before heading out to the next level which is at a higher difficulty.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 17, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHyAgvJ_0lQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85054-hadron\n"}
