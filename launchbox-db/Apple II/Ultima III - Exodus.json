{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultima III: Exodus", "overview": "Ultima III: Exodus is the third game in the Ultima series. Exodus is also the name of the game's principal antagonist. Released in 1983, it was the first Ultima game published by Origin Systems. Originally developed for the Apple II, Exodus was eventually ported to 13 other platforms, including a NES/Famicom remake. Exodus featured revolutionary graphics for its time, as one of the first computer RPGs to display animated characters. Also, Exodus differs from previous games in that players now direct the actions of a party of four characters rather than just one. During regular play the characters are represented as a single player icon and move as one. However, in battle mode, each character is represented separately on a separate \"battle screen\" and the player alternates commands between each character in order, followed by each enemy character having a turn. Thus the player must understand weapons and magic commands and employ rudimentary tactics in order to overcome each opponent. This differs from the two previous games in the Ultima series in which the player is simply depicted as trading blows with one opponent on the main map until either is defeated. Enemies on the overworld map can be seen and at least temporarily avoided, while enemies in a dungeon may appear randomly without any forewarning.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ORIGIN Systems, Inc.", "publishers": "ORIGIN Systems, Inc.", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_III:_Exodus", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=HErKitZ0ovM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83311-ultima-iii-exodus\n"}
