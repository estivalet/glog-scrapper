{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape from Rungistan", "overview": "Escape from Rungistan is an interactive fiction computer game written by Bob Blauschild for the Apple II and released by Sirius Software in 1982. Rungistan combines graphical elements with text-based commands. The game begins with the player sitting in a jail cell and one is asked to enter a command. Rungistan was the first text adventure game to introduce the element of time; in certain situations, the player was required to perform a certain action before the time ran out, such as defusing a bomb. Also, it was the first text adventure to feature arcade-like sequences, such as skiing down a hill and avoiding trees.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 8, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Rungistan", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84671-escape-from-rungistan\n"}
