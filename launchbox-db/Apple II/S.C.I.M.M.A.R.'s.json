{"altername_name": ["SCIMMAR's"], "name": "S.C.I.M.M.A.R.'s", "overview": "S.C.I.M.M.A.R.'s is a 1-player combat simulator. The player takes control of a S.C.I.M.M.A.R. (Surface Contragrav Individual Manned Mobile Antivehicle Raider), a fast-moving 1-man armored assault vehicle armed with 2 frontal cannons and small shield. Battle takes place on the volcanic planet Trulgren 1, a land covered in flat volcanic planes, where the rich aristocrats of Trulgren 4 wager on the success and failure of S.C.I.M.M.A.R. pilots. Player from 1-st person perspective, there are 8 levels of difficulty, which determine the player and their opponents shield strength. All combat is one-on-one, and the shielding of individual aspects of the vessel are displayed on the bottom of the screen. The top of the screen provides radar to detect enemy vessels and a rearview mirror. The player can turn 360 degrees, and accelerate and decelerate to attempt to blast their opponent. The game is over when one vessel is destroyed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "Avalon Hill", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372000-scimmars\n"}
