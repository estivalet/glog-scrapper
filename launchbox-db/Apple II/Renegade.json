{"altername_name": [], "name": "Renegade", "overview": "This is the scrolling beat 'em up by Technos which started the Kunio / Nekketsu High series. The original takes takes place in a Japanese city, whereas its western version named Renegade is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn. This conversion later produced unofficial sequels Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter. You must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Novalogic", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83341-renegade\n"}
