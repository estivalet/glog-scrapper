{"altername_name": [], "name": "I.O. Silver", "overview": "I.O. Silver is a puzzle game, that comes with two modes: The Arcade Workshop, which is your basic game and Strategy Lab, where you can train in the levels and think of the best way to solve them. In the game you play as a professor, who has to make his way out, by pushing the right puzzle tiles together, till none is left. Those tiles can also be used to squash enemies, but be careful, as the very same tiles can also squash you. The game features a month-system. After December 31, the game is over for you, if there are still tiles left. You can also go on vacations, which are basically the pauses in the game.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 18, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beagle Bros Software", "publishers": "Beagle Bros Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113925-io-silver\n"}
