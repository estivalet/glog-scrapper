{"altername_name": [], "name": "Inhumane", "overview": "Supposedly published by a company \"Infobom\", Inhumane, derived from Infocom's Infidel, is rudimentary, sophomoric satirical text adventure. Awakening in an abandoned archaeological desert dig site, the player is brought up to speed through plot-advancing notes kindly left behind by Francisco Roboff (on loan from the Mask of the Sun), a \"friend\" who returned to civilization with all the treasures he'd surreptitiously excavated from the pyramid dig site save one, the golden coffin he couldn't find -- and left his old pal behind to unearth. After some cursory to-ing and fro-ing, the player accesses the subterranean vaults of the buried pyramid, discovering no fewer than nine different deathtraps and a peculiar motivation to experience them all first-hand. Should the player succeed, in this self-effacing goal, boundless treasure awaits in the form of the golden coffin... as well as a somewhat inscrutable joke about the author's high school geometry class.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sadistic Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371502-inhumane\n"}
