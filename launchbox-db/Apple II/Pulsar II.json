{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pulsar II", "overview": "In Pulsar II, the player controls a spaceship which circles clockwise or counterclockwise around a central pulsar. Surrounding the pulsar are 3 shields moving in opposing directions. The spaceship shoots at the shield, which causes fields of energy to blanch off and attack the player's ship. When the player has exposed the central core, the pulsar will shoot large beams of energy at the spaceship. If the central core is shot, it is destroyed. If the player is struck, they are destroyed. When the player destroys the central pulsar, they move to a more difficult level where the shields regenerate more rapidly. At level 1, only one attacking piece of shield is on the screen at a time. For each difficulty level, one more piece is present at a time. The player receives 200 points + 100 x level for destroying the pulsar. The player has a total of 3 ships, and when all are gone it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373505-pulsar-ii\n"}
