{"altername_name": ["Beneath Apple Manor: Special Edition"], "name": "Beneath Apple Manor", "overview": "Beneath Apple Manor is an early roguelike game released by Don Worth for microcomputers, which had a Lo-Res Apple release in 1978 (through The Software Factory) and high-res multi-platform releases in 1982 and 1983 (through Quality Software). The goal is to obtain a Golden Apple on the bottom floor of the dungeon. There are 10 rooms per level in the low-res version, and 5 in the high-res version. The high-res versions may be played in low-res/text mode, thereby gaining this increase in level size. It is notable for being the first commercial role playing game developed and released for a home computer as opposed to a mainframe computer. Despite being included in the \"roguelike\" genre, Beneath Apple Manor actually predates Rogue (created in 1980) by two years. The creator claims that neither he nor the implementors of Rogue knew about the other game", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "July 31, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Worth", "publishers": "Quality Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneath_Apple_Manor", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84157-beneath-apple-manor\n"}
