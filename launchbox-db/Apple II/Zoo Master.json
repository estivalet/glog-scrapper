The Mad Scientist has released all the animals from their pens at the zoo, and the zookeeper must track him down while tranquilizing the escaped enemies. The player controls a small truck, which they must direct through a maze. They can move in the 4 cardinal directions, and are armed with a tranquilizer gun for sedating escaped animals. The player is also armed with 4 traps in each zone, which can be dropped to capture animals. Each zone contains a variety of animals, including bears, turtles, snakes, giraffes, elephants, and rhinoceroses. There are also a variety of birds on each stage, and the player is awarded 1000 bonus points if they capture all variety of birds on a stage. The player loses a life if they contact an animal, although they can safely collect birds without tranquilizing them. The player's goal is to continue to travel south, passing through a number of animal-filled zones. In the final zone, the player encounters the mad scientist within his lair, who drops cages full of bears to slow the player's progress. The player is awarded 5000 points and an extra life for capturing, and restarts the game on a slightly higher difficulty level. The player starts with 3 lives, and if they are hit by an animal, they restart at the beginning of the zone.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Ryan", "publishers": "Earthware Computer Services", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seYoXFrIIzs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152282-zoo-master\n"}
