{"altername_name": [], "name": "Raster Blaster", "overview": "Raster Blaster is one of the very first computer pinball simulations, created by Bill Budge. It was the foundation for Budge's later hit Pinball Construction Set and is an unofficial adaptation of the Williams pinball table Firepower. The game has two difficulties - in Easy mode a ball shield is always present, but it must first be activated in Hard mode - and up to four players can play the game, taking turns.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BudgeCo", "publishers": "BudgeCo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371574-raster-blaster\n"}
