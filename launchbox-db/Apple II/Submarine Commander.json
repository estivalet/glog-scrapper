{"altername_name": [], "name": "Submarine Commander", "overview": "Submarine Commander is a 1982 video game for the Atari 8-bit family written by Dean Lock and published by Thorn EMI Computer Software. A VIC-20 port by Gary York was released in 1983, and an Apple II version by Patrick Buckland the same year. The Atari version was re-released in 1985 on cassette as part of the Sparker brand of low-cost games. A version for the TI-99/4 was announced[4] but was not released until 1986 when a 3rd party bought the rights. The game opens displaying the control console, whose square middle section shows a map of the Mediterranean with your current location displayed as a white cross and the locations of enemy ships as black dots.[5] Various status details are shown in the two rectangular areas on either side of the map.[6] Forward movement is controlled by the number keys, 1 for slow and 9 for maximum. On the surface the submarine moves more rapidly and recharges its batteries and air supply. The joystick provide directional control through the rudders and dive planes. This is a slow process, turning the ship right around in a 360 degree circle takes considerable time even at full speed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 11, 1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Thorn EMI Computer Software", "publishers": "Thorn EMI Computer Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86347-submarine-commander\n"}
