{"altername_name": [], "name": "Police Blotter", "overview": "Police Blotter is a 1 - 4 player mystery solving game. The 13th Precinct is never dull. You're a rookie detective on Captain Reddick's crack force, and if you want to work here, you have to stay on your toes, keep track of the clues and watch your back. Your beat is the streets of Queensport. Pulled from the files of the QPD are seven tantalizing cases to be investigates and solved by one to four detectives. The player must travel to different locations throughout the precinct, interview witnesses, gather clues, and read reports. Ultimately, the player must attempt to gather enough information to convincingly prove to to Captain Riddick the culprit or what truly happened during the case. A case clock tracks how much time each player has spent trying to solve individual cases.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "Avalon Hill", "genres": "", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372008-police-blotter\n"}
