{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bez-MX", "overview": "Bez-MX is a 1-player versus computer or 2-player competitive wargame. Two virtually identical countries share a common border. A Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty has kept the peace for many years between these countries, but one stipulation to this deal is forbidding any transportation of weaponry across the border. A minor electronic malfunction in one highly sophisticated BEZ-1 Bomber has caused a simple training mission to turn into war. There are 3 gameplay options: Basic war, Advanced war, and Solitaire. The player can play versus a computer opponent of varying difficulty, or two player can compete against each other. Players take turns moving their troops and defenses to different locations to avoid enemy fire, as well as launching intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers at their enemy to attempt to destroy their forces. Players are blinded to their opponents movements on each turn. The game ends when one opponent is entirely destroyed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bez", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371861-bez-mx\n"}
