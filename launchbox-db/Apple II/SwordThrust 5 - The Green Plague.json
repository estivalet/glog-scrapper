{"altername_name": [], "name": "SwordThrust 5: The Green Plague", "overview": "Few citizens of the kingdom can forget that fateful day four months ago when Baron von Drummer returned from his morning duck hunt and found a man lying unconscious at the castle's entrance. In spite of the eerie shade of green that the man's skin had acquired, the Baron picked up the body and carried it into the castle, to have it cared for properly. The next day, the Baron awoke to find the castle in panic. The man had died, and all of the Baron's family and servants shared the same green skintone. One by one, the people fell into a deep sleep until the only one left awake was a visiting wizard named Korial. As she felt herself falling asleep, she cast a spell she had learned in the depths of the Earth. She spoke one great word of power, a great crack opened in the ground, and the castle vanished forever. Alas, Korial's great sacrifice seems in vain. The plague is sweeping the kingdom, killing all it touches. Can you save the kingdom, or will you enter the sleep that never ends?", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 12, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ace Software", "publishers": "Ace Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116268-swordthrust-5-the-green-plague\n"}
