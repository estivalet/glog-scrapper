{"altername_name": [], "name": "Death in the Caribbean", "overview": "Death in the Caribbean is an old-style text/graphics adventure. You are an treasure hunter on an unnamed Caribbean island searching for buried pirate gold. You'll travel through numerous locales, a tricky maze, and past fierce alligators on your way to the chest of Doubloons. Puzzles range from \"find object and apply to situation\" to a doozy of a cryptogram. As for mechanics, the graphic section of the screen draws itself in visible pen elements (i.e.: Outline then fill, move on to next shape). Below the graphics window is a simple command line with a tiny bit of room above for the brief written description of the area you are in. Like every good adventure game, the puzzles start easy and get more difficult as you progress, until they get just plain silly hard. Play time is about 30 hours. It comes on 4 disk sides, the front and back of two floppy disks. This game does not innovate upon the genre, and is built on the gameplay of its predecessors", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 7, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Fun", "publishers": "Micro Fun", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84602-death-in-the-caribbean\n"}
