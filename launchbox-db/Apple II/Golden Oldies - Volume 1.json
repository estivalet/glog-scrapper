{"altername_name": [], "name": "Golden Oldies: Volume 1", "overview": "Probably the first retro-collection ever foisted upon the buying public. A collection of four classic computer games (well, three computer games and an adaptation of an electronic video game.) Play Eliza, Conway's Life, Crowther's Adventure, or Al Alcorn's Pong. All four games are liberal adaptations - there is no standard Eliza, and this version seems to lack compared to others. Pong is an ASCII rendition of the game (and includes a remake with color!). Life, however, includes various pre-formed populations, including the infamous glider-gun that figures prominently in Steven Levy's book Hackers.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 28, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115138-golden-oldies-volume-1\n"}
