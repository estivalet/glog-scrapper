{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plasmania", "overview": "In Plasmania, you are a microscopic ship traveling through your patient's bloodstream destroying viruses and pathogens. Be careful though! Every time you shoot or run into enemies or the wall of the blood vessel, you make your patient sicker. The game ends when the patient sustains too much damage and dies. Game play is very similar to a vertical version of the arcade game Scramble.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/TjE5k90q9H8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113831-plasmania\n"}
