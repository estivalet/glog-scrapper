As bearer of the Ring of Order, your mission is to free Lisa before reality is disrupted beyond retrieval. Ring Quest is the nominal sequel of The Quest. Ring Quest returns you to the magical land of Balema, accompanied once more by Gorn, your water-swilling strong-arm. Far to the north is your ultimate goal, the sorceress's mountain citadel. As though its shield of green lightning were not adequate, you soon encounter other obstacles, including trolls, manticores, amorous ogresses, and greedy seers.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 27, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Origin Systems", "publishers": "Origin Systems", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85543-ring-quest\n"}
