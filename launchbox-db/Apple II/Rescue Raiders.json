{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rescue Raiders", "overview": "Rescue Raiders is an Apple II game published by Sir-Tech in 1984. It was designed by Arthur Britto and Greg Hale. The game is played on a two-dimensional side-scrolling gamefield, where two players start at main bases on opposing sides of the field. The player operates a Choplifter-esque helicopter defending a string of advancing units, which the player purchases throughout the game. The objective is to create and defend a force that can escort a van filled with explosives to the enemy base at the other end of the playing field. Along the way a series of smaller bunkers act as obstacles by flying balloons which, when operating for the opposing team, will destroy the player helicopter (the cable will severely damage the helicopter). The bunkers may be taken over by delivering enough infantry units, which may reach the bunker either by walking all the way from a main base without being killed, or by being carried there more quickly in the player helicopter. The helicopter begins with three weapons: heat-seeking missiles, machine guns, and bombs. As the game progresses, additional weaponry is introduced.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 27, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sir-Tech Software", "publishers": "Sir-Tech Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_Raiders", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_XsRYTO-0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85524-rescue-raiders\n"}
