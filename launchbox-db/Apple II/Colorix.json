{"altername_name": [], "name": "Colorix", "overview": "Colorix mainly mimics Columns in its gameplay, but with the graphics simplified to the extreme, so that it may even be played on a non-graphical system (as long as there are colours). Strips consisting of three coloured blocks are dropped from the top of the screen, and the player may rotate the strips in 90 degree turns, or rotate the coloured blocks within the strip. When a vertical, horizontal or diagonal combination of three blocks of the same colour is achieved, those blocks are removed from the screen, and the score is increased. Make bigger combinations for higher scores.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "July 29, 2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ventzislav Tzvetkov", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140372-colorix\n"}
