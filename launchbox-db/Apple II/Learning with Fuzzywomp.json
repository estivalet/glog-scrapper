{"altername_name": ["Learning with FuzzyWOMP"], "name": "Learning with Fuzzywomp", "overview": "There are four kinds of different educational games intended for kids. They include knowledge and numerical order (the digits, which are represented as bubbles, fly out from a pipe, and you must help FuzzyWOMP blow them out in the proper order); digit definition (the clown shows the digit and FuzzyWOMP must dispense the right amount of balls - if the number is correct, the clown juggles them. If it's wrong, he gets upset); calculating, comparing, and memorizing (a domino is shown and is then hidden, and FuzzyWOMP has to choose the same one from the six possible variants); and shooting (after creating your assistant you have to shoot FuzzyWOMP).", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_FuzzyWOMP", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169224-learning-with-fuzzywomp\n"}
