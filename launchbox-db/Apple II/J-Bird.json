{"altername_name": [], "name": "J-Bird", "overview": "J-Bird is a conversion of the arcade game Q*Bert. The object of the game is to change all tiles in a pyramid to the target color by having J-Bird jump on the tile. Various creatures and objects can get in the way of J-Bird. These include a bouncing snake, cats, falling balls, and frogs. There are four rounds per level, and each level increases in difficulty by having more enemies onscreen and requiring more complicated rules for a tile to reach the target color (for example, on the second level you need to jump on each tile twice). On the sides of the pyramid are platforms which J-Bird can jump onto to evade the snake. If the snake is close enough to the platform when J-Bird jumps on, the snake will fall off the edge.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Orion Software", "publishers": "Orion Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372756-j-bird\n"}
