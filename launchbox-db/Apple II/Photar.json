{"altername_name": [], "name": "Photar", "overview": "Photar is a single player space-themed arcade game for the Apple II. The player controls a small spaceship that can only shoot vertically upwards. The ship can move horizontally through the length of the screen, and can also move a short distance vertically. At the beginning of each level, a number of alien vessels slowly approach the player's vessel by strafing left and right. Small barriers on the game play area deflect alien ships, and also block the player's shots. Larger alien shields worth bonus points bounce about the screen. If the player destroys all the small alien vessels, they move to a more difficult level with faster moving vessels. The goal is to achieve a high score, for which the player only has one life.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 18, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Baker", "publishers": "Softape", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125593-photar\n"}
