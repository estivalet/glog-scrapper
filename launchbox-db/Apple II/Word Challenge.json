Words must be formed by using the next nearby letter, and each letter can only be used once in forming a word. The game includes a built-in dictionary, and only available words may be used to score points. The player competes against a computer opponent, with the goal of typing more correct words in a given time period than the computer opponent discovers. Players can modify the skill of the computer opponent, timer time, size of the game board, scoring method, and other aspects.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Hayden Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83313-word-challenge\n"}
