The player controls a small creature named Fuzzy, whose goal is to jump on differently colored cubes of a pyramid, changing their color. When all the cubes have changed their color, the player is able to advance to the next level. An evil bouncing snake is there to make things difficult; it will sabotage Fuzzy's work and attempt to get rid of him. The game was developed by Capitol Ideas Software, and early independent game development group which primarily did games for the Apple II. The studio was owned and operated by John Romero of Doom and Wolfenstein 3D fame.
