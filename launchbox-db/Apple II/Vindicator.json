{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vindicator", "overview": "Vindicator is a fast-paced 1-player arcade game for the Apple II. The player controls a robot which can fire in multiple directions, and can move rapidly about the screen. The player is tasked with protecting a number of eggs placed about the screen from a vulture enemy that will attempt to steal them. After destroying all enemies on a level, the player will receive a bonus for the number of eggs remaining. The player is armed with a limited number of disruptor bombs, which will eliminate all enemies on the screen, but can only be used a few times per game. Numerous enemies, including: dragons which chase the player, robots which fire upon the player, a truck which drives across the screen, and more, threaten the player. It comes with a built-in sprite editor to modify monsters, but does not save the changes. The player starts with 5 lives, and when all are lost it's game over, or when all eggs are lost on a level", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dragonfly", "publishers": "H.A.L.
