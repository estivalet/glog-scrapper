{"altername_name": [], "name": "Moon Patrol", "overview": "A straightforward adaptation of Williams' cult arcade classic, Atari's Moon Patrol for the Apple II is a somewhat stripped-down, no-frills experience which concentrates on the action of the game, rather than getting the visuals or the sound right. The game offers either joystick or keyboard control (and fair warning: the keyboard control scheme is nearly impossible). Moon Patrol manages to give justice to most of the visuals, though some of the graphic nuances -- the lunar cities in the background, the shading on the triple-sphere ships which lob crater-making bombs at you -- is sacrificed, probably due to the Apple II hi-res mode's limited color range. Completely absent is that jaunty little tune which accompanied the arcade Moon Patrol and even home versions like Atari 2600.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqh9UEtOV2Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40322-moon-patrol\n"}
