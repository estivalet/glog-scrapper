{"altername_name": [], "name": "Storm Warning", "overview": "Storm Warning is a 1 - player arcade game for the Apple II. The player controls a pickup truck which moves left and right at the bottom of the screen as a large storm destroys the houses along the street. People will randomly appear in the doorway of the houses, and the player can gather them in his pickup and bring them to the storm shelter in the bottom right of the screen. The player's truck can only carry two people, and the player receives 10 points for each person brought to the storm shelter. The player can pick up building supplies at the store on the bottom left of the screen, and use these to rebuild the homes destroyed. If the storm destroys a building while a person stands in the doorway, the person is killed, and a small cross appears at the bottom of the screen. When all homes or 3 civilians are destroyed, it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert R.
