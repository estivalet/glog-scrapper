{"altername_name": [], "name": "Round About", "overview": "Round About is an abstract shoot'em up for the Atari 8-bit home-computer family, the Apple II and the Commodore 64 . The player controls a round object which may travel along any edge of the square play field. The ship can fire bullets toward the opposite edge of the field at various enemies. Each stage introduces a new enemy type by name (\"Zoots\" \"Flooz\" etc. . .), which move in a unique pattern. Additionally, a small happy-face will chase the player around the edge of the play field. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, a fast-moving enemy will appear, quickly bouncing off the edges of the play field. Round About encourages the player between stages with exclamations such as \"Awesome!\" or \"Tubular\", each of which appear and fade uniquely. Additionally, there are several cut-scenes which display after a set number of stages. There is no end; eventually the player will revisit waves of enemies from earlier. After running out of lives, gameplay ends.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 27, 1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Datamost, Inc.", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85530-round-about\n"}
