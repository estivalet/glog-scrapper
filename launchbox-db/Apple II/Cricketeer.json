{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cricketeer", "overview": "Cricketeer is a Frogger variant where the player takes control of a cricket that like in the arcade original first has to cross a heavily trafficked street and then a river before jumping into one of five home boxes on the far end of the river. Unlike the arcade game the street and river sections take place on separate screens. A level is completed when all five home boxes are occupied by crickets and the game then moves on to a higher level. Lives are lost after being hit by a vehicle or jumping into the river and when they are all gone the game is over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 5, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rod Nelson", "publishers": "The Software Farm", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xjxjm4qCPA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84535-cricketeer\n"}
