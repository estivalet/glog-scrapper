Pandora is a science-fiction-themed strategy game for the Apple II. Returning to base after a long mission of gathering exotic and dangerous specimens from the frontiers of human exploration, the B.S.M. Pandora is badly damaged by a freak accident. You are one of the crew members abruptly awoken from the suspended animation of cold sleep. You face a heart pounding race against time to repair the Pandora before it shuts down under irrevocable computer control. You and your fellow crew members cooperate to solve the desperate damage control problem while simultaneously warding off the attacks of alien creatures now loose inside the corridors and pods of the Pandora. Players move their character about the many levels of the B.S.M. Pandora. Gameplay can be either real time or turn-based, and the player controls 1 - 7 characters. The player finds weapons and armor strewn about the ship, some of which needs to be repaired, allowing the player to fight the monsters endangering the ship. Computer equipment allows the player to repair ship systems. The player can take control of robots to fight for them. Five levels of difficulty are available, and a save/restore feature is available.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simulations Publications", "publishers": "Simulations Publications, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "7", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144563-the-wreck-of-the-bsm-pandora\n"}
