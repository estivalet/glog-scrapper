{"altername_name": ["Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn: The Third Scenario"], "name": "Wizardry III: The Legacy of Llylgamyn", "overview": "Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn (originally known as Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn - The Third Scenario) is the third scenario in the Wizardry series of role-playing video games. It was published in 1983 by Sir-Tech Software, Inc. The City of Llylgamyn is threatened by the violent forces of nature. Earthquakes and volcanic rumblings endanger everyone. Only by seeking the dragon L'Kbreth can the city be saved. Legacy of Llylgamyn is another six level dungeon crawl, although the dungeon is a volcano so the party journeys upwards rather than downwards. The gameplay and the spells are identical to the first two scenarios. Parties of up to six characters could adventure at one time.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sir-Tech Software", "publishers": "Sir-Tech Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83318-wizardry-iii-the-legacy-of-llylgamyn\n"}
