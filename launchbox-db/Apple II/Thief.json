{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thief", "overview": "Thief is an action game in the style of Berzerk. The player finds himself in a maze full of robots and has to find his way through four levels of play. It's viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player can move and shoot in eight directions. The objective is simply to destroy as many robots as possible to get a high score. There are three ways to kill the robots. First one is simply to shoot them with the laser gun. The second way is to wait until an unearthly blob appears. The blob kills everything in its way, both robots and the player, so the player has to escape quickly to avoid it as it can not be killed. The third way is to trick the robots into destroying themselves. After scoring 400 points, the robots start shooting at the player. With the right positioning, it's possible to have them accidentally shoot each other. The player has three lives and loses one when getting shot or touching a robot or the walls of the maze. Reaching 2000 points leads to an extra life. Bonus points are received when all robots on the screen are killed. Despite the game's title, it does not involve any sneaking or stealing.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 8, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datamost", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114656-thief\n"}
