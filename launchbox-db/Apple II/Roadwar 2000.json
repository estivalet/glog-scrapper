{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roadwar 2000", "overview": "Roadwar 2000, sometimes referred to as Roadwar 2K, is a 1986 computer game published by Strategic Simulations, Inc.. It is a turn-based strategy game set in a post-apocalyptic future which resembles the world portrayed in the Mad Max movie series. In 1999, a terrorist group unleashes a deadly virus on the United States, leading to its collapse. Various vigilante and survivalist groups appear and cars become the primary form of transportation and combat. The player starts off as sort of a scavenger and attempts to build up an army capable of making crossings between cities on highways, which have become littered with hordes of maurauding mutants, cannibals, and criminal gangs. Winning enough battles and gathering a sizable army may bring the player's character to attention of the ailing US government, who will recruit the player to find eight missing scientists, America's only hope to finding a cure for the disease. The player must bring them back to a secret base. Along the way, the player must loot cities and scavenge for needed supplies and munitions.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 27, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadwar_2000", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85550-roadwar-2000\n"}
