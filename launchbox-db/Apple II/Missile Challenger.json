{"altername_name": [], "name": "Missile Challenger", "overview": "Missile Challenger is a 1-player shoot 'em up game based heavily on Missile Command for the Apple II. The player controls two turrets on the bottom corners of the screen, each of which is armed with 11 shots to to defend the player's city from incoming ICBMs. The player has 4 cities positioned in the bottom center of the screen which must be defended by moving a crosshair about the screen and firing off defensive warheads. If the player's turret is struck, it is nonoperational for the rest of the round. The player receives a bonus at the end of each round based upon the number of cities that are still standing. Each round leads to a progressively more dangerous assault, and defensive missiles and turrets are replenished after each level. It's game over when all cities are destroyed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Philip Koopman", "publishers": "Micro-Ware Distributing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154468-missile-challenger\n"}
