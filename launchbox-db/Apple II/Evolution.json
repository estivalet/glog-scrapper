{"altername_name": [], "name": "Evolution", "overview": "Evolution is an arcade style action game with six levels where you need to evolve from an amoeba to a human. Each level is a different stage in evolution with it's own unique goals. The first level is the amoeba stage where you need to eat all the DNA on the screen while avoiding the spores, microbes, and antibodies that are trying to stop you. The second level is the tadpole stage. The tadpole needs to eat three flies to move on to the next stage while avoiding the very hungry fish. Next is the rodent stage, where you need to eat five blocks of cheese while avoiding the snakes. In level four you need to guide a beaver across alligator infested waters to retrieve sticks and build a dam. The fifth level is the gorilla stage, where your gorilla has to use coconuts to fight off monkeys that are trying to steel its orange stash. And finally is the human stage, where you have to use a laser gun to fight off mutants that are trying to take over the earth.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 8, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sydney Development", "publishers": "Sydney Development", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84674-evolution\n"}
