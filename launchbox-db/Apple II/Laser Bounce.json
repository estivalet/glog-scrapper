{"altername_name": [], "name": "Laser Bounce", "overview": "Allows for 2-player competitive play or 1-player versus computer gameplay. The player controls a set of crosshairs to aim a laser shot from the bottom corner of the screen at alien vessels as they scroll by. There are two types of vessels. One causes the laser shot to bounce back at a 90 degree angle, while the other causes a vertical shot straight down. On the bottom of the screen are 5 protected spots for each team, with the goal being to bounce your shot into the enemy's base and destroy all 5 protected spots. The player who destroys their opponent's base first wins. There are 3 computer opponent difficulty levels.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imaginative Systems Software, Inc.", "publishers": "Hayden Book Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372991-laser-bounce\n"}
