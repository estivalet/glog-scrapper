{"altername_name": ["3-D Docking"], "name": "3-D Docking Mission", "overview": "3-D Docking Mission is a game where the player has to steer a spaceship through an asteroid field and reach a docking station. The screen is split in two and shows both a top view and a side view of the asteroid field. In the side view the player can move the ship up, down, forward and reverse, while in the top view movement can only be done left and right. The game uses thruster controls, where one button press causes the ship to move until the opposite key is pressed. A collision occurs when hitting an asteroid in both the top view and the side view, and the game then has to be restarted. It is also possible to run out of fuel, which happens when using too much thrust. When reaching the docking station, a score is given based on the time it has taken.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Oberth", "publishers": "Programma International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.99", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Docking_Mission", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66-CqOuBQpY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84136-3-d-docking-mission\n"}
