{"altername_name": [], "name": "Free Fall", "overview": "Free Fall is an action game where the player controls a man who has to fall from the top of the screen to one of several holes located at the bottom. The player enters the screen hanging from an elevator at the right and upon reaching the top it's possible to move left and right along the ceiling. With the press of a button he will let go of the ceiling and fall towards the bottom. While falling it's still possible to steer left and right. There are a number of girders moving across the screen and when falling over these the player will automatically catch onto them. When successfully dropping through a hole it will fill in and the player will be transported back to the top. A level is completed when all holes have been filled in. Missing a hole leads to a life being lost. The game consists of three stages and after completing the third the game restarts at a higher level. In all the stages the player has to avoid upwards moving needles since contact with them will lead to death. Other dangers exist but are different for each level. In the first there are bombs and bouncing balls. If a ball hits a bomb it will explode and the player dies if caught in the resulting debris. Riding a girder off the screen to the left will also lead to death but not when doing so to the right. In the second stage girders bounce off the edges and cannot leave the screen. It also lacks bombs but the bouncing balls are explosive by themselves. The third stage is identical to the first one but with the addition of two guns moving up and down along the right edge. When two guns cross over each other they will fire a bullet and the player dies if hit.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM8qFv-oA9c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113921-free-fall\n"}
