{"altername_name": [], "name": "Donald Duck's Playground", "overview": "Donald Duck's Playground won several awards from educational software magazines as best educational game of the year. In it, you are Donald, working to earn money, which you then spend to buy playground equipment for your nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie to enjoy. The first job is to guide the Amquack Express around a top-down map with 8 stations, setting the junctions to ensure that packages are delivered to the correct stations. His job in produce involves catching fruits as they are thrown at him and placing them in the correct basket. At the toy store he must sort items by shape and colour, and be careful with the security switch. His final job is at an internal US airport, soring products based on their location's delivery code. The equipment for the playground must then be purchased and arranged, helping young minds get an appreciation of money management and cash-handling.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck%27s_Playground", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115704-donald-ducks-playground\n"}
