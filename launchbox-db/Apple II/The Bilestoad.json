{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Bilestoad", "overview": "In a rather dystopian future, mobs and overpopulation threaten societal collapse. To pacify the masses, a simulated-reality diversion is designed: the Bilestoad, a form of recreation where people can vent their aggressions in virtual gladiator combat. This takes place on a series of islands, where the computerized gladiators (\"meatlings\") battle each other in pairs, each armed with an axe and a shield. There are separate keyboard controls for swinging each arm, for turning, and for walking. Wounds ooze blood and gore, and the meatlings can even hack each other's arms off (leaving the victim without weapon or defense). The action is viewed from above, with additional radar screens showing the map at different zoom levels. Each island comes with an arrangement of special items that play crucial roles in combat: teleporters, gliding discs for extra speed, and exit portals. The goal is to advance in class up to the Master level; after five islands (if the player is found worthy), the next class is unlocked. This also serves as a password feature - the hidden 'password' is unique to the player, but is used to generate the class (level) codes that can be entered to continue one's progress.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 2, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marc Goodman", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bilestoad", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3q2j7LpFb0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34769-the-bilestoad\n"}
