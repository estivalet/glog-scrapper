{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beast War", "overview": "Beast War is a strategy/board game, resembling the Star Wars chess scene on the Millenium Falcon. In each round of a battle, you direct the movement of six different semi-intelligent beasts on a circular, 43 space field, trying to destroy opposing beasts and capturing their squares. Each beast has its own movement pattern, energy level, strength, and unique advantage over the others. Combats are shown in a small action sequence where each beast may advance, strike, or retreat.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncfe6P9Po9c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83372-beast-war\n"}
