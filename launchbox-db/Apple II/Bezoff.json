{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bezoff", "overview": "Bezoff is a series of 3 insect-themed 1-player arcade games. The player has a series of 3 mini-games with the goal of maximizing their score during these games. To choose which order to play the games, the player starts by controlling a small circle in a hallway connected to three rooms. The player moves the circle into the room to initiate the game. In one game, the player controls a pair of scissors, and spiders rapidly descend from the ceiling to the floor on a thread. The player must position the scissors so they can cut the spiders' thread, or the spiders themselves, causing the spider to crash to the floor. If the spider reaches the floor unharmed, the player loses a life. Each round, more spiders descend from the ceiling. Lose 3 lives, and the minigame is lost. In the next minigame, the player controls a large boot, while ants approach from the two sides of the screen trying to reach the sugar cube in the center of the screen. The player's goal is to stomp the ants to prevent them from reaching the sugar. If the player stomps on the sugar, or the ants reach the sugar, the player loses a life. Lose 3 lives, and the mini-game is over. In the final mini-game, the player controls a can of bug spray, and must shoot insects as they fly across the screen. If the player contacts the insect, or the insect manages to fly across the screen, the player loses a life. Once again, there's three lives in total.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bez", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371856-bezoff\n"}
