{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bop-A-Bet", "overview": "Bop-A-Bet is an educational typing and letter-recognition game for children. Four letters appear on the screen, and the player must correctly choose the letters in alphabetical order. If the player correctly selects a letter, the next letter alphabetically will appear somewhere on the screen, and the correct letter will disappear. The player can select from uppercase or lowercase letter recognition, and receives 10 points for each letter correctly selected, and loses 5 points for a mistake. After reaching the letter Z, the player enters a bonus mode where they can bop punching bags for 20 points each. The player can set a time-limit per letter to increase or decrease the difficulty level.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunnyside Soft", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371759-bop-a-bet\n"}
