{"altername_name": ["Quadrant 6112"], "name": "Quadrant 6112.", "overview": "Quadrant 6112 is a space-themed arcade game for the Apple II. Your watch is quiet. Scanners show nothing of rebel activity as you comb quadrant 6112. Suddenly, a stargate gapes open, and a lone rebel ship warps into space. More alien comrades quickly stream through to attack. Alone, you must keep this quadrant safe from the alien invaders. The player controls a small arrow-shaped ship which can rotate 360 degrees. The ship can move forwards, and only has the ability to fire straight forward. The player must fly through a dark quadrant, where a number of invisible walls are present until a ship runs into them. Some alien ships fly about randomly, bumping off of walls, while others can pass through walls, and move invariably towards the player. If the player's ship is struck by alien fire or vessel, it is destroyed. The player has a total of 3 ships, and when all are destroyed, it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sensible Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368203-quadrant-6112\n"}
