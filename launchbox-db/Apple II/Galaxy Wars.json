{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxy Wars", "overview": "Galaxy Wars is a 1-player space-themed arcade game for the Apple II. The player controls a small rocket ship which can move slowly horizontally on the bottom of the screen. On the top of the screen are a number of alien saucers which rain laser blasts upon the player. In between these combatants lies a rapidly moving asteroid field that can block fire. If the player destroys all enemy vessels, they advance to a more difficult stage. The goal is to maximize score, and points are awarded for destroying alien ships. The player has 3 rockets, and it's game over when all are lost. An enhanced version called Super Galaxy Wars was also released.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 27, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starcraft", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113795-galaxy-wars\n"}
