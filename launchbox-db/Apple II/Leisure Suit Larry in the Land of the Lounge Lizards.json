{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards", "overview": "Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is a graphic adventure game originally released in 1987 as the first part of the Leisure Suit Larry series. Originally developed for the PC DOS and the Apple II, it was later ported to other platforms such as the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, Apple Macintosh, and the Tandy Color Computer 3. It utilizes the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) engine made famous by King's Quest: Quest for the Crown. The game's story follows a middle-aged male virgin named Larry Laffer as he desperately tries to \"get lucky\" in the fictional American city of Lost Wages. Land of the Lounge Lizards establishes several elements which recur in the later Larry games, including Larry's campy attire, perpetual bad luck with women, and penchant for double-entendres. The story and basic structure of the game are lifted from Softporn Adventure, a 1981 Apple II text adventure. Despite a lack of advertising, the game was a sleeper hit and a commercial and critical success. Sierra developed and published a remake that used the Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine with 256 colors and a point-and-click, icon-driven (as opposed to text-based) user interface, released for the PC DOS, Apple Macintosh, and Amiga in 1991. A second, high-definition remake, titled Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded, was developed by N-Fusion Interactive working with series' creator Al Lowe and published by Replay Games in 2013.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 15, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry_in_the_Land_of_the_Lounge_Lizards", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87022-leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards\n"}
