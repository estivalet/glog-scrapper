{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fracas", "overview": "Fracas is Stuart Smith's very first game, using the game system which would later develop into Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves and ultimately Adventure Construction Set. Like those games, it is combat-oriented turn-based RPG and one of its main features is the large numbers of characters, both good and bad, that can get involved in the battles at once. You may control one or more characters in the game, and move them about fighting bad guys and gaining treasures.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computersmith", "publishers": "Quality Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ty3pweccA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106173-fracas\n"}
