Just when he was doing what he does best (dozing off in a closet), the shrill sound of an alarm penetrated the air. Arcada is attacked by the evil Sariens! Before Roger realizes what is going on, he discovers that he is the only survivor. The Sariens have killed the entire crew and stolen the valuable Star Generator. Roger's immediate task is to find a way to leave Arcada, which is about to explode in fifteen minutes. And then he'll have to show the Sariens why they should never mess with brave intergalactic janitors! Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter is a humorous sci-fi adventure game made with Sierra's AGI engine. There are puzzles to solve and plenty of situations where the player will have to use his wit to save Roger from death.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "July 29, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84063-space-quest-i\n"}
