{"altername_name": ["Miner II"], "name": "Miner 2049er II", "overview": "Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the mine. The sequel to the original Miner 2049er, it contains 10 more levels of difficult futuristic mines to explore. You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. Yukon Yohan has a whole bag of dirty tricks to prevent you from thoroughly exploring each level. You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels. You'll encounter ricocheting ore jumps, time warp transporters, and radioactive stalactites. Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Fun", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373290-miner-2049er-ii\n"}
