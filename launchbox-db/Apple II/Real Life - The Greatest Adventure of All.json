{"altername_name": [], "name": "Real Life: The Greatest Adventure of All", "overview": "Real Life: The Greatest Adventure of All, an \"interactive novel\" by Relational Systems Corporation, is billed as a simulation of life, to help you figure out where you're going, or perhaps how to avoid getting there. The game features a split-screen setup: on the left, descriptions are given and commands are entered. A list of possible commands appears on the right side of the screen. The game was soundly trashed by John C. Dvorak in MacUser, who called it \"insensitive\", \"self-righteous\", and \"offensive\". According to the author's son, the Dvorak article just about ended all sales of the game.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 13, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Relational Systems", "publishers": "Relational Systems", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116311-real-life-the-greatest-adventure-of-all\n"}
