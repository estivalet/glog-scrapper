{"altername_name": ["Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics"], "name": "Spy vs. Spy III: Arctic Antics", "overview": "Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics (also known as Spy vs. Spy III: Arctic Antics ) was the third game in the series, and switched the location from a tropical island to the frozen wastes of the Arctic. The spies fought by means of throwing snowballs at each other and setting traps, which decreased their body heat bar. Tools the spies used included a saw which allowed a hole to be cut in the ice for the second player to fall into and lose body heat. Lost body heat could be restored by moving into an igloo with a heater inside.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 10, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Star Software", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy_(1984_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zJ8qpJE6BM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86310-spy-vs-spy-iii-arctic-antics\n"}
