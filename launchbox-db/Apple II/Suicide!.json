{"altername_name": [], "name": "Suicide!", "overview": "Suicide is an action game similar to Atari's Avalanche. The player has to catch falling cretin creatures before they hit the ground. This is done by moving a saver bar left and right along the bottom of the screen. Each of the five levels is played for a specific amount of time and the player has to stay alive by not letting more than the allowed number of creatures get killed. This will cause the player to lose one of three lives. There are two special creatures that the player has to be extra careful about. Creatures that fall upside down have to be saved or a life will be lost, while creatures with only one antenna have to be avoided since catching these will also lead to a life being lost.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 11, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Piccadilly Software", "publishers": "Piccadilly Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86348-suicide\n"}
