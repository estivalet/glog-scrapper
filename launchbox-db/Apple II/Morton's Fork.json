{"altername_name": [], "name": "Morton's Fork", "overview": "Morton's Fork is an adventure game which places the player in a wizard's fortress while searching fame and fortune. Morton's Fork is the third entry in the Maces & Magic Series. At the start of each adventure, the player rolls a character, and must equip them from the supply store using limited funds. Having just emerged from the dense forest surrounding the store, the goal is to sneak into a castle to solve puzzles and gather treasure. An early text-based RPG, the player inputs commands by choosing multiple choice options. The player can collect a variety of items, and use them to solve puzzles. The player must type individual verbs to state what they wish to do with an item. The player is awarded a final score based upon the number of puzzles solved. Players have limited weight capacity, which restricts items and gold carried. If a player dies, they must restart the castle from the beginning. Combat occurs through random dice rolls with limited strategy. The player and the monster take individual turns hitting each other until one character runs out of hit points and is defeated. Weapons effect damage dealt while armor reduces damage received. A character can leave the scenario by returning to the forest, and cashing in any treasure they have accumulated. They are awarded a score, and can return to the scenario at a later time with their improved attributes and equipment.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 24, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chameleon Software", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85341-mortons-fork\n"}
