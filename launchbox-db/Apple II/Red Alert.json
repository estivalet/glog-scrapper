{"altername_name": [], "name": "Red Alert", "overview": "Once again the world is on Red Alert - the aliens are coming and try to destroy everything! Good thing the player is on the case to command the defense line, the Van Apple Rediation Belt. This belt is a red shield placed above five building. Every alien bomb destroys a part of the shield and every part (one pixel width) can take two hits. If a building is underneath the destroyed part, the next bomb makes it go boom and its positive influences are lost. The player controls a crosshair over the screen to mark the goal for the two meanie blasters. The other buildings are a radar (improves the blasters' splash radius), a rocket (wipes all enemies on the screen) and a belt repair kit (renews the shield). Every shot alien ship rewards points which are not only important for the high score but also controls when the rocket is recharged and the shield is repaired. Every few ten-thousand points an alien supply ship enters the screen; shooting it down repairs one destroyed building. The game ends when both blasters are gone.
