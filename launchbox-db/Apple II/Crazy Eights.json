{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Eights", "overview": "Crazy Eights is an adaptation of the card game with the same name. It is played by one player who competes against an AI opponent. The player is dealt eight cards and the aim is to discard all of the cards before the opponent does so. Discarding is done by matching the rank or suit of one of the cards with the top card in the discard pile. If there are no playable cards, new ones have to be drawn until there are. Eights are wild cards and when placed allow the player to select the suit of the card that the opponent has to play next. The game is played with keyboard and the player selects cards by entering the number that is written above each card. Before starting out it's possible to turn on options to have the computer highlight playable cards and to have the opponent's cards laying face up.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 20, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Smith", "publishers": "Softape", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115715-crazy-eights\n"}
