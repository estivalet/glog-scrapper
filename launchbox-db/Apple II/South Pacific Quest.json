{"altername_name": [], "name": "South Pacific Quest", "overview": "The object of the game is to capture or kill Lord Futz. In order to do this, you must conquer the Futz soldiers with the aid of various devices, passing through 16 screens of hi-res action. Peter Ward wrote South Pacific Quest in 1985 and unsuccessfully tried to market it and hence was never published. In 1987, after months of persuasion, Peter was convinced to release this game to the community for free.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Ward", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371499-south-pacific-quest\n"}
