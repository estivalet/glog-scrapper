{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ribbit", "overview": "Ribbit is a Frogger variant which in most ways works just the same as the arcade original. The player controls a frog that first has to cross a interstate highway without being hit by a vehicle and then a river without falling into the water. The aim of the game is to reach the holes on the opposite end and get a frog into each hole. When successful the game moves on to the next level where traffic moves faster and the river has less logs and turtles to jump onto. The player starts out with three lives and one is lost every time the frog is hit, falls in the river, moves outside the screen or doesn't move quick enough. Each frog has about 35 seconds to reach a hole. Later levels have some surprises including a stomper trying to get the player. In addition to the regular mode, there is also a demo mode. The demo mode has no limit on the number of lives but there is neither any scoring shown on the screen.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 27, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Piccadilly Software", "publishers": "Piccadilly Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85525-ribbit\n"}
