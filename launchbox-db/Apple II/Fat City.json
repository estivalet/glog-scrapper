{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fat City", "overview": "If you've ever dreamed of being in control of a wrecking ball, with blocks and blocks of defenseless buildings at your mercy, Fat City is your chance. You're placed in charge of the massive multi-ton instrument of metallic destruction, and get a first-person view of the proceedings as you gleefully unleash devastation on everything in your path. The playfield scrolls in four directions, and you proceed from city to city by mowing down every structure on the block (without running out of fuel). Evidently there's some resistance to the demolition plans, and various flying objects aimed at your vehicle attempt to convey the message. These will shorten your career if they hit, but can be deflected with a carefully-aimed swing of your wrecking ball. Fortunately, you can fill up your tank by finding fuel depots, so that the satisfying *crunch* of crumbling masonry may go on a while longer.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Optimum Resource", "publishers": "Weekly Reader Family Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164040-fat-city\n"}
