{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ogre", "overview": "Ogre is a 2D turn-based strategy game, and a direct computer conversion of Steve Jackson's board game of supertanks going against conventional infantry with howitzers. It plays exactly like the board game - on a hex-based board one player controls ordinary military units (soldiers, tanks etc.), and defends against the second player, who controls a supertank named \"Ogre\" - Ogre is very powerful, and can easily destroy normal weaponry and ground forces.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Origin Systems", "publishers": "Origin Systems", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWnNG4lw24Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88495-ogre\n"}
