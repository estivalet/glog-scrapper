{"altername_name": [], "name": "California Games", "overview": "California Games is a 1987 Epyx sports video game for many home computers and video game consoles. Branching from their popular Summer Games and Winter Games series, this game consisted of some sports purportedly popular in California including skateboarding, freestyle footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. The game sold very well, topping game selling charts for winter months. It also got very positive reactions from reviewers, many of whom consider California Games to be the last classic Epyx sports game, due to staff changes not long after its release. The game was followed in 1991 by California Games II, but the sequel failed to match the original's success.
