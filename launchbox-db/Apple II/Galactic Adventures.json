{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galactic Adventures", "overview": "Galactic Adventures is a sequel to Galactic Gladiators. This game blends role-playing and strategy elements in a science fiction setting. Players create characters from among seven races, explore a series of planets, interact with friendly and hostile aliens, shuttle personnel and cargo between worlds, take quests from guilds, pilot ships in space combat, and fight long, complex tactical battles. Successful adventures reward the player with money, equipment, experience, and increases in a wide variety of skills. The nominal goal of the game is to amass enough experience for \"Independent Adventurer\" status, but it encourages personal goal-setting, scenario-building, and open-ended gameplay.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 13, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Adventures", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE8Bz21lzx0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84886-galactic-adventures\n"}
