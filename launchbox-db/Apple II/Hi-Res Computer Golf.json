{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hi-Res Computer Golf", "overview": "Hi-Res Computer Golf is an early golf simulation. It allows for 1 - 4 player games on five different difficulty 18-hole par 72 courses. There is also a practice mode, which teaches how to play, and a demonstration mode. The game features true-to-scale fairway design, often requiring two to three screens to display. There are wind factors, 8 clubs to choose from, and fairway obstacles including: sand traps, roughs, water traps, and groves of trees. There are different contoured greens, which require modification of play to improve putting. The game is played from a top-down perspective, and the golfer must choose their direction, club and type of swing for each round. When the player tees off, they need to control their club throughout the arc of the swing. If they do not come in contact with the ball, they lose their swing. The efficiency of each shot is based upon how well the player swings, and how solidly they contact the ball.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 28, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Avant-Garde Creations", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113886-hi-res-computer-golf\n"}
