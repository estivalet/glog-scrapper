{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gamma Goblins", "overview": "Gamma Goblins is a fixed screen shoot 'em up that takes place in the human body. The player begins an exploratory operation into the circulatory system, where the infectious gamma goblins launch feverish attacks. Beyond its medical theme, it's a traditional shoot 'em up, although here the enemies mostly move vertically and not horizontally. The player moves his plasma ray gun down the bottom of the screen and has to shoot the enemies before they shoot or crash into him. To finish a wave of enemies (and move to the next kind) the player has to kill them all before they reach the bottom or a new wave will come and the player's position will move a step closer to them. Some enemy types have to be killed before they reach the bottom, or the player will die. The player has limited fuel and will lose a life if it runs out. To regain fuel, the player has to hit a nurse's station to get a transfusion. The gameplay and sprites are very similar to those in the arcade game, Astro Fighter.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Benny Aik Beng Ngo", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zps4IM6FcXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370781-gamma-goblins\n"}
