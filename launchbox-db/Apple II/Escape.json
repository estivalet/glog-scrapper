{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape", "overview": "This is a collection of three mini-games loosely adapting the May, 1983 Choose Your Own Adventure gamebook number 8 of the same name. In that book, the reader plays a secret agent underground in the nation of Dorado, a fractured rump state of the former US southwest in the year 2035. The book concerns itself with escaping from this totalitarian state and returning to democratic Turtalia; the game covers similar territory with less hyperfiction and more primitive driving and flight simulators, following traversal of a 3D maze representing town streets accessed after a jailbreak. With the player are three fellow travelers: Matt, resistance leader Zoey, and codebreaker Fred -- one of whom is a traitor.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bantam Software", "publishers": "Bantam Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83497-escape\n"}
