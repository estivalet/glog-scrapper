{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stickybear Bop", "overview": "Stickybear Bop is a 1-player carnival shooter for kids. Based upon the Stickybear series of games for children, the player controls a small shooting device which can move horizontally left and right at the bottom of the screen. The player shoots vertically upwards, and must hit a number objects or points. Each level consists of 3 rounds, where the player has a limited number of balls. In the first round, the player shoots objects that are moving horizontally across the screen, with smaller higher objects worth more points. In the second round, 2 bears on the sides of the screen juggle objects, and the player has to shoot them as they are juggled. In the final round, Stickybear drops objects from a balloon, and the player must shoot them as they fall to the ground. After completing the 3 rounds, the player moves onto a more difficult series of challenges. The player loses if they are unable to hit any objects on a level, if they are hit by a projectile from Stickybear's balloon, or if on later lives any of the dropped bags from the balloon hit the ground.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 18, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Optimum Resource", "publishers": "Weekly Reader Family Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115659-stickybear-bop\n"}
