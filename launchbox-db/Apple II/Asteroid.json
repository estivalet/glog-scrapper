{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asteroid", "overview": "Asteroid is a variant of Atari's arcade game Asteroids which was renamed Planetoids shortly after its release due to the similarities. The gameplay is the same as in the arcade original with the player having control of a ship that has to destroy the surrounding asteroids. The ship can be rotated and is moved by using thrust to send it forward. There is also the possibility of entering hyperspace which sends the ship to a random location on the screen. In addition to the asteroids there are some enemy ships whose fire the player has to dodge. The Apple II version has four difficulty levels: easy, regular, hard and custom made. The regular mode have the features of the arcade game. In the easy mode all the asteroids' fragments become explosive while in the hard mode the asteroids are attracted to the ship. The custom mode allows the player to select a combination of options.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marc Goodman", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143903-asteroid\n"}
