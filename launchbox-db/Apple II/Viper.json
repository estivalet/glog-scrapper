{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper", "overview": "Viper is a 1-player arcade game for the Apple II. The player controls a continuous snake that can move in the 4 cardinal direction. On the screen appears a mouse, who will slowly move about. The goal is to move the snake so that it eats the mouse. Every time the snake eats a mouse, it elongates, and a new mouse appears on the screen. If the snake runs into a wall or its own tail, the player loses a life. The player gains 3 points for every snake eaten, and gains a new life at 500 points. The player can define mouse and snake speed, as well as how many obstacles appear in the playfield. The player starts with 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RDA Systems", "publishers": "RDA Systems", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgNd6Sx1Qxk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166645-viper\n"}
