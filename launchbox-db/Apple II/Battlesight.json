{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battlesight", "overview": "Welcome to World War III. The Warsaw Pact Army crashed through the West German border at 0530 hours today. You have five M60A3 Tanks dug in on the high ground overlooking the enemy's avenue of approach. Situated between the towns of Fulda and Schlitz with Lauterbach to your rear, it is up to you to stop or at least slow the advancing Red Army. The enemy forces are made up primarily of T-62 tanks with T-72 tanks interspersed. The enemy is supported by HIND-A missile firing helicopters and reconnaissance aircraft. Total of 5 difficulty levels with the option of night missions where vehicles are only visible while firing. Enemy tanks stream from the top of the screen, and fire upon the player. The player must use the joystick to move a crosshair over enemy tanks, and fire. You are hidden well, and each wave will not see the player unless they open fire or are spotted by an enemy plane. The goal is to destroy as many tanks as possible, while avoiding anti-tank fire from helicopters. The player can take a total of 5 direct hits before their tanks are destroyed. Minor hits can damage the tank, requiring the player to enact repairs. When all five friendly tanks are destroyed, or when 5 enemy tanks bypass the player, it is game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr Xerox", "publishers": "Versa Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=0Mi9zI2dqFI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371664-battlesight\n"}
