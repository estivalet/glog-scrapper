{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle of Hoth", "overview": "Battle of Hoth is a Star Wars themed 1-player arcade game for the Apple II. Three columns of Imperial AT-AT walkers walk inexorably from the right of the screen towards the Rebel defensive positions on the left. The player controls a Rebel snowspeeder, which travels from the left ot right of the screen, and can fire horizontally to the right. The player can move the snowspeeder vertically up and down, and must avoid fire from the AT-ATs and shoot them down. Whenever an AT-AT is destroyed, a new AT-AT immediately appears to the right of the screen in that row. The player's goal is to survive for 300 seconds to allow for evacuation of Rebel forces. If an Imperial vessel reaches the left of the screen, the Rebel forces are routed, and the player loses the game. The player starts with a total of 9 snowspeeders, and if all are lost to Imperial fire, it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tukumo Original Soft", "publishers": "Baked Apple Users Group", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV0MND5eLb4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114969-battle-of-hoth\n"}
