{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape (Muse Software)", "overview": "One of the first games by Silas Warner which, along with his Maze Game, provides an early demonstration of first-person visuals in home computer games. The objective is escaping from a building, which consists of a randomly-generated maze, by navigating from the south-eastern corner to the exit at the north-west. The player is equipped with a pass, which may help when encountering guards (though some of them will just confiscate it instead). Random people are encountered along the way, who can be questioned, though they will not always tell the truth. Sometimes they provide more-or-less helpful items, like passes, maps and compasses - these, too, may be true or fake: some degree of logical astuteness will be needed to divine a way out.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "December 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Muse Software", "publishers": "Muse Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112568-escape-muse-software\n"}
