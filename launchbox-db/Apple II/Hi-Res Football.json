{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hi-Res Football", "overview": "Hi-Res Football is a computer adaptation of the American football sport. It features a single match between either two players or one player against the AI. Player controlled teams can be named while the AI team is simply called Apple. The game is real-time and all action is controlled with paddles. The playing field is seen from a top down perspective although only forty yards of it can be seen at any time. When playing against the AI the player is always on offense. A match begins with the two players choosing their offensive and defensive plays. There are eleven offensive plays and nine defensive plays to choose from and each one determines the line up and initial movement of the players. The offensive player only has direct control over the ball carrier, the others follow the selected play. Once these movements have been played out they will follow the movement of the ball carrier. When defending the paddle controls the motion of the free safety while other players move depending on the selected play. When those movements have been completed they will move in the direction of the ball.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 28, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jay Sullivan", "publishers": "On-Line Systems", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113807-hi-res-football\n"}
