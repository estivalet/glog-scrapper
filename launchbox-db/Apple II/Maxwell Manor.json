{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maxwell Manor", "overview": "In this action game with top-down and side-view sections, you play Professor Arabesque who has been sent by the Psychical society to rid the controlling influence of the Skull of Doom. Arabesque must jump and shoot through the Manor, to collect the treasures and use them to solve the mystery. When you die you enter a limbo room, in which one exit (randomly-selected by the game) restores Arabesque; the others result in death. Every time you play, the bonus items are randomly placed, and the exact map layout is adjusted. There are over 1000 variations and ten skill levels. Much like today's FPS' there are vases to reload the gun and grant lives. They are reset at the beginning of each game hour.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 23, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85294-maxwell-manor\n"}
