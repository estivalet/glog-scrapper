{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny", "overview": "Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny (1988) is the fifth entry in the role-playing video game series Ultima. After having mastered the eight Virtues, attaining Avatarhood and retrieving the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom in the previous game, the Avatar is summoned back to Britannia by his old comrades Iolo and Shamino using a magic coin, which was included as a trinket in the game's box. Upon arrival he is greeted by Shamino but they immediately come under attack from the three powerful beings known as the Shadowlords. Warriors of Destiny featured much more polished writing (earlier games were riddled with some spelling errors and uneven vocabulary) and considerably greater detail than previous games. It was the first Ultima to implement a time-of-day system in which the sun rises and sets, and non-player characters follow daily routine schedules. This game has been lauded as realistically portraying a culture living under a dictatorial regime; its tone is much darker than that of Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Origin Systems", "publishers": "Origin Systems", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_V:_Warriors_of_Destiny", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=5GvWMmlfmgs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83331-ultima-v-warriors-of-destiny\n"}
