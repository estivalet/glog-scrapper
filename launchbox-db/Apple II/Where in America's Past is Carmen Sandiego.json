{"altername_name": [], "name": "Where in America's Past is Carmen Sandiego", "overview": "Where in America's Past Is Carmen Sandiego? is the 5th videogame release of the Carmen Sandiego franchise. This game is widely considered the most informational game of the entire series. Though it may contain some minute differences from the main series, it remains true to it. The game's aim, as with the others, is to capture Carmen's gang of thieves, one-by-one, until all of her henchmen have been caught. This is done by searching for clues, trailing them, identifying them and, finally, bringing them in for trial. After all of the henchmen have been caught, the player must then go after Carmen herself. One of the main differences is that the player can receive in-game help. PC Mag explains that \"While Where in Time simply challenges players to look up and recall historical facts, Where in America's Past develops a true historical context for places and events as it covers more than 400 years of American history\".", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "December 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_America%27s_Past_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115661-where-in-americas-past-is-carmen-sandiego\n"}
