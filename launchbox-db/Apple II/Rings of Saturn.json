{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rings of Saturn", "overview": "In Rings of Saturn, your mission is to firstly make your way through the rings to reach a stranded ship, then get all the people onboard it off before it explodes, and get them safely aboard your ship. Once you have done this, set course and go back to your base. This would be simple except throughout your mission you encounter alien ships, giant ice chunks, and other hazards endangering your craft. There is also a time limit. The game is a mixture of a space shoot-em-up and a Trek type game, with a large screen showing a view of the space outside the ship, and your controls below. Familiar commands for communications, shields, engines, tracking are available, both short and long rang scans, with the default setting for short range. Turn on the Photon arming sequence then you can start firing at enemy ships & other obstacles in your way, using the sights. Rings of Saturn has four skill levels to choose from, 3-d animation, hi-res color graphics, and sound effects. The duration of play is based on real time and players may use paddles or joystick controls. There is even a Hi Score table, so you can beat your previous score.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Level-10", "publishers": "Level-10", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113839-rings-of-saturn\n"}
