{"altername_name": [], "name": "Golf", "overview": "Golf is a 1 - 2 player graphical golf simulation for multiple systems. Played from an overhead view, the player must battle through 18 randomly generated golf courses. Each course contains a water trap and a green. The player selects the direction they wish to hit the ball, and which club they want to use, from 0 - 9. The player loses a swing if their ball goes out of bounds or lands in the water. If the player successfully gets to the green, they enter a putting phase where they merely have to select the direction to putt. The game keeps track of the player's score through 18 holes.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Instant Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155359-golf\n"}
