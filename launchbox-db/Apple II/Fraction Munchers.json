{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fraction Munchers", "overview": "Fraction Munchers is the second maths based game in the Munchers series of educational games. Aside from the subject matter, the basic concept is the same as other games in the series.

Other creatures known as troggles roam the grid and try to get to the muncher. There are five different ones and they all have their own behaviour and movement patterns. Eating wrong answers or getting caught by a troggle leads to a life being lost. There are four different game modes which decide what kind of statements should appear: fraction types, equivalents, comparing and expression. Additionally there is a combined mode that mixes all.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 20, 1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "MECC", "publishers": "MECC", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116456-fraction-munchers\n"}
