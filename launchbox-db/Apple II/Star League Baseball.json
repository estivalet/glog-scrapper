{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star League Baseball", "overview": "Game review by www.geekometry.com \"In 1983, a small software company in Santa Barbara, California, Gamestar, Inc., released a groundbreaking new baseball game \u2013 Star League Baseball. The game itself was still simple. Two teams, still no leagues or divisions, with no-name rosters and a basic stat engine, but still amongst the best. The revolutionary parts of Star League Baseball are its budding attempts to simulate \u201ca baseball game\u201d. First, presentation is similar to a local-broadcast of a game. No commercials, but trivia, \u201cscores from around the league\u201d, attendance numbers, etc, are all presented between innings. Second, Gamestar went beyond just stats, and, for the first time, brought in the human-element by adding fatigue to pitchers. Star League Baseball helped lay the foundation for current generation sports simulations, by adding previously unused variables, it turned sports games towards the direction of simulating the sport. There were still limitations: you could only bring in relievers in the 7th or opening of extra innings, pitchers and batters are all right-handed, and all base runners are the same speed, but sports games would never be the same again.\"", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 11, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GameStar", "publishers": "GameStar", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86330-star-league-baseball\n"}
