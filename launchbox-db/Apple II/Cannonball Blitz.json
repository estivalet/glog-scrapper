{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cannonball Blitz", "overview": "This game was developed and published in 1982 by Sierra On-Line for the Apple II. The game is a Donkey Kong clone, with cannonballs and cannons replacing barrels, and a soldier replacing the large ape. Also \"Pauline\" is replaced by a flag you have to capture by grabbing onto a balloon that brings you to the platform. The game was also eventually ported to both the Commodore VIC-20, as well as the TI-99/4A.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Blitz", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz9fRQpqC5E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83426-cannonball-blitz\n"}
