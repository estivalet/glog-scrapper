{"altername_name": [], "name": "Picnic Paranoia", "overview": "The player is guarding four full picnic tables while armed only with a fly-swatter and an occasional can of bug spray. Ants soon crawl on-screen and, in character, attempt to carry the food away. Spiders that lay delaying webs show up on round two, and can sting player, paralyzing him, if he isn't careful. A flying wasp, which also stings, appears at random. Points are awarded for swatting any of these marauders. Each round lasts a minute and a half and, at the end of each round, bonus points are awarded for any remaining food. As soon as all food is pushed off of the screen, or a round ends with no food still on any of the tables, the game ends.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Synapse Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic_Paranoia_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114824-picnic-paranoia\n"}
