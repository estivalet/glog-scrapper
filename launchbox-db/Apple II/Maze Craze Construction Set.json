{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Craze Construction Set", "overview": "Maze Craze Construction Set is a combination Pac-Man game plus maze construction set for 1 - 2 players for the Apple II. Gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, in that the player must collect dots while avoiding enemies in a maze. Power-ups are available which will temporarily make enemies vulnerable, and a level is finished by consuming all the dots. Other than this, almost all aspects of gameplay can be customized. The player can choose a number of different sprites to represent their protagonists and antagonists, and can also create their own custom sprites. The number of mazes, the order they are played, and level design and power-up location can be modified. The intelligence of enemies and the precision of hit detection is also open for modification. Mazes can be saved and shared with other players.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Hammond", "publishers": "Data Trek", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114930-maze-craze-construction-set\n"}
