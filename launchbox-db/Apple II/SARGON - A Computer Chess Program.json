{"altername_name": ["Sargon I"], "name": "SARGON: A Computer Chess Program", "overview": "The original SARGON was written by Dan and Kathleen 'Kathe' Spracklen in a Z80-based computer called Wavemate Jupiter III using assembly language through TDL Macro Assembler. The name was originally written entirely in capitals because early computer operating systems such as CP/M did not support lowercase file names. SARGON was introduced at the 1978 West Coast Computer Faire where it won the first computer chess tournament held strictly for microcomputers, with a score of 5-0. This success encouraged the authors to seek financial income by selling the program directly to customers. Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte magazine selling for $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer. Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. In 1979, a complete rewrite was necessary later for the Apple II port, made by Kathleen's brother Gary Shannon. It was published by Hayden Software.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan and Kathleen Spracklen", "publishers": "Hayden Book Company, Inc.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_(chess)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91300-sargon-a-computer-chess-program\n"}
