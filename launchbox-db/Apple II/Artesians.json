{"altername_name": [], "name": "Artesians", "overview": "Artesians is a 1-player arcade game for the Apple II. Driven by your desire for a special beer, you have been driven to don a burglar's mask and enter the secret Artesian Brewery. Once inside, you must gather empty bottles while heading to the 4th floor of the brewery, where you can fill your bottles with beer. As you stalk through the brewery, you leave footprints behind. The clever canine Floyd can follow your footsteps, and if he tracks you down, he will begin to bark loudly and incessantly. Floyd can be distracted by dropping bones in the brewery, but his barking will arouse the watchman Old Hank from his slumber next to the fountain. Old Hank will descend his private elevator to your floor, and will attempt to apprehend you. If you are caught, you will be sentenced to 5 years of beerless jail time. The Artesians roams about the brewery, and slow the player down. They are scared by light bulbs. The player can move in the 4 cardinal directions, and if they come in contact with a barrel, they will fall to a level below, and break their bottles. There are total of 4 levels of the brewery. On the first level, the player must travel through a tight maze. On the second layer, the player must cross fast moving conveyor belts, and on the third level, they must move on large gears. The player is victorious should they fill 4 bottles of beer.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "RenoSoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163217-artesians\n"}
