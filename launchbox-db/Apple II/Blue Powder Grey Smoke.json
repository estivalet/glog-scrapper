{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blue Powder Grey Smoke", "overview": "Blue Powder Grey Smoke is a strategy war game based upon the American Civil War. 1-player versus computer or 2-player strategy game played in semi-real time. The player can choose from a number of historical and non-historical missions, from either the Confederate or Union perspective. In the non-historical setting, the positioning of troops and the characteristics of reinforcements are randomized, so as to not represent the original battle conditions. Gameplay uses a number of historically accurate types of arms. During play, the player can move between 3 different zoom levels to monitor the action of their troops in realtime, but the action can be paused at any time to issue commands. Commands are issued via a menu system, and the player can choose objectives for their individual troops, as well as the speed, offensive, and defensive positions they wish them to take.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Garden", "publishers": "Gard\u00e9 Games of Distinction", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Powder_Grey_Smoke", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVD0dtgUKuc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84160-blue-powder-grey-smoke\n"}
