{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tubeway", "overview": "Tubeway is a 1982 computer game for the Apple II, created by David Arthur Van Brink and published by Datamost. The game is similar to the 1981 Atari arcade game Tempest. Tubeway is a shooter in which the player uses paddles to move a small white crosshair around the top of a \"tube\" or wall while firing down at the computer-controlled opponents attempting to scale their way up it. The opponents consist of triangular green homers (100 points) and triangular blue seekers (200 points), both of which can return fire. A special opponent called the germ occasionally emerges from a white box in the lower left corner of the screen. The goal of the game is to clear as many levels as possible before running out of lives. An extra life is granted every 20,000 points.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Datamost, Inc.", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubeway", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86465-tubeway\n"}
