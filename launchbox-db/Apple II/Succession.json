{"altername_name": [], "name": "Succession", "overview": "Succession is an action game set in a Pac-Man-like maze. The player controls the Masher, a creature with an antennae on its head that has to chase and catch little creatures that have numbers on their bodies. It is necessary to get the creatures in the right order or they will all reappear and it needs to be done before a timer runs out. At the same time there is the Chaser, a larger creature that is trying to get the player and has to be avoided. The game contains four levels. Each new level has one additional creature to catch and runs a bit faster.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Eisnaugle", "publishers": "Piccadilly Software Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115017-succession\n"}
