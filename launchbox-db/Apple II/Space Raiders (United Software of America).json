{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Raiders (United Software of America)", "overview": "Space Raiders is an early Star Raiders clone. You begin the game viewing a map of the galaxy, which shows how many alien starships and starbases occupy each sector. Your mission is to clear the aliens from all sectors. Upon entering a sector, the view changes to a first-person perspective flying through space, where you must move a crosshair reticule around the screen and blast the aliens. Your supply of energy is limited but can be refilled upon visiting a starbase. The aliens look like tie-fighters and the starbases resemble the Death Star.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Lutus", "publishers": "United Software of America", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86289-space-raiders-united-software-of-america\n"}
