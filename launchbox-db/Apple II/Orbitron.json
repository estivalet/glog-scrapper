{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orbitron", "overview": "Orbitron is a shoot 'em up where the player is in control of an orbiting space station that is being attacked by alien drones. The drones place killer satellites in orbit around the space station and the player has to shoot them down before they make one orbit or else they will crash into the station. This is done by moving a cursor around left and right around the station. Outside the station are two meteor shields which circle around it and the player can only shoots in the gaps between them. In addtion to the satellites it is also possible to destroy the drones, but they too have shields circling around them, and meteors which appear between regular waves. After a completed wave a mother ship will appear and places a satellite in a fixed position that quickly has to be shot down.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 26, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85422-orbitron\n"}
