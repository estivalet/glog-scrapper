{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hungry Boy", "overview": "A Pac-Man clone for the Apple II. Help Hungry Boy get a good meal by eating all the fruits and dots he finds in the Great Maze. Hungry Boy has to be careful, because right on his trail are a pack of ghosts. Hungry Boy has to avoid the ghosts while trying to eat his fill. The game features 10 levels of difficulty. There are four different types of ghosts; the red ghost tries to trace the player, the green ghosts tries to deceive the player, the white ghost strolls at random, while the purple ghost is good at ambushing. When the player eats one of the blinking dots, they get points based upon how many ghosts they eat. 200 points for the first ghost, and 400, 800, and 1600 points for each respective ghost thereafter. Every time the player eats all the dots in the maze, they progress to a higher level of difficulty.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Astar International", "publishers": "Programe", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372725-hungry-boy\n"}
