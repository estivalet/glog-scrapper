{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Rocky Horror Show", "overview": "Play as either Brad or Janet to rescue the other, in this computer adaptation of the hit Broadway Musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Search the castle for pieces of the Medusa machine to free your partner from stone and escape the castle before it blasts off. Each one must be taken to the De-Medusa machine, only carrying one at a time. You must collect keys and disable force fields along the way. Other characters in the game will hinder your progress by stealing and hiding your clothes or other objects you may be carrying. Watch out for Riff-Raff or he'll shoot you with his laser gun. And if Eddie thaws out and escapes from the freezer, he'll run you over with his motorcycle.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CRL Group", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Show_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85552-the-rocky-horror-show\n"}
