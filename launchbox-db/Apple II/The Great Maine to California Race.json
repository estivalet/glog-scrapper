{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Great Maine to California Race", "overview": "The Great Maine to California Race is an educational game that teaches geography and facts about the American states. The game is for two players (or one player against the computer) who both control a dragster. The aim of the game is, as the title says, to drive from Maine and reach California before the opponent does so. In each state there are a number of questions related to the state to be answered. Correct answers allow the player to drive on to the next state where new questions are asked. However a wrong answer can force the player to move back to an earlier state. The number of questions depend on the size of the state. When there are multiple borders the player can choose which state to go to next.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 15, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natalie Jesdale", "publishers": "Hayden Software Co., Inc.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114917-the-great-maine-to-california-race\n"}
