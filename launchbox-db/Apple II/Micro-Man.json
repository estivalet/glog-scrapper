{"altername_name": [], "name": "Micro-Man", "overview": "Micro-Man is a text-based 1-player variant of Pac-Man The player moves about a small text-based character through a maze, while trying to avoid 4 other text-based characters called \"them\". The player must try to collect all the dots in the maze, as well as the 4 energizers which make \"them\" temporarily vulnerable. If the player collects the dots, they progress to a more difficult level. The player starts with 3 lives, and a life is lost when they contact \"them\". It's game over when all 3 lives are lost. This was a port of George Delp's TRS-Man (for the original monochrome TRS-80 line), which was released in the January 1982 issue of SoftSide Magazine. This was also released in the May 1982 issue of SoftSide Magazine, however the Apple II conversion was done by Bill Pu.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Pu", "publishers": "SoftSide Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166160-micro-man\n"}
