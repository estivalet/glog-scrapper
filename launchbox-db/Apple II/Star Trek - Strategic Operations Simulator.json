{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator", "overview": "Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator (also known as Star Trek: SOS and Star Trek Arcade) is a space combat simulation arcade game based on the original Star Trek television program and movie series, and released by Sega in 1983. Unlike most arcade games of the time, the player is presented with multiple views of the play field. Throughout the game, survival depends on the player's ability to effectively use and manage shield energy, photon torpedoes, and warp energy. These are replenished by docking with starbases, which sometimes must be saved from destruction at the hands of the Klingons.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 11, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86334-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator\n"}
