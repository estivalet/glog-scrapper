{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crime Wave", "overview": "You are the law in Crime Wave. You drive your cop car around town and try to catch robbers in the act of crime. You catch the thieves by running into their car once it changes to red (indicating that they are robbing a building). Then you take them to the station at the bottom of the screen. Your life is complicated by other traffic such as ambulances and cars that haven't yet committed a crime. The one-way streets can also make your life miserable.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Penguin Software", "publishers": "Penguin Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--HBTDSQs1k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160344-crime-wave\n"}
