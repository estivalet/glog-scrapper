{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Dark Heart of Uukrul", "overview": "The Dark Heart of Uukrul is a first-person perspective, turn-based fantasy computer role-playing game written by Ian Boswell and Martin Buis of Digital Studios Limited, and published by Br\u00f8derbund. The game was released in 1989 on the Apple II and in 1990 on the IBM PC. The game comprises a classic party of four heroes trying to defeat the evil magician Uukrul and reconquer the city of Eriosth\u00e9, going through many puzzles and riddles. It has a classic top-view turn-based combat system and a pseudo-3D first-person perspective for exploration. The party can also throw magic spells or pray to whimsical gods, and despite its basic, primitive graphics, there are plenty of variety among enemies. However, it's noted that the strength point of the game are the puzzless, secrets, level design and riddles around them, beyond the hack-and-slash and vast mazes.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Studios Limited", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Heart_of_Uukrul", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88484-the-dark-heart-of-uukrul\n"}
