{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mandragore", "overview": "Mandragore is a role-playing game that was originally released in France. The kingdom was at peace under King Jorian. When he was killed in a freak accident that peace was shattered as Lord Yarod-Nor took control and began a reign of tyranny and evil. The player leads a party of four characters (with the option to either define your own characters or take a predefined group) through the land to eventually challenge, confront and defeat Yarod-Nor in his own castle. Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to trade, and develop your characters skills.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 8, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115355-mandragore\n"}
