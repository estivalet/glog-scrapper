{"altername_name": [], "name": "T.rex: The Dinosaur Survival Adventure", "overview": "T. rex: The Dinosaur Survival Adventure is a 1-player educational game created by Keron Productions and released in 1984. The player takes control of a Tyrannosaurus as it tries to survive in the late Cretaceous. The player can move in all directions in a forest clearing that scrolls laterally. The T. rex has health, energy, and food bars that show the dinosaur's current needs. Movement and activity decrease food, and this must be replenished by hunting and eating other dinosaurs. Some dinosaurs like Triceratops and Ankylosaurus pose a danger to T. rex and are dangerous to hunt. The player can walk at slow speeds or run and must ambush and chase down prey species as they run away. The T. rex must drink water from lakes, maintain adequate body temperature, and overall care for itself. There are 4 levels of game difficulty.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Keron Productions, Inc.", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165969-trex-the-dinosaur-survival-adventure\n"}
