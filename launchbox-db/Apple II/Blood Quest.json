{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blood Quest", "overview": "Blood Quest is a parody graphical adventure game. A long time ago in a kingdom reasonably close to where you are sitting, plague and famine were rampant throughout the land. Brutality was the only law of the land. The player must traverse strange landscapes, wide oceans, and deep throats. The ultimate goal is to revenge the death of your Great Aunt Phoebe at the hands of Einar the Off. At least, that's what the introductory text says. None of this actually happens in the game. Gameplay starts with character creation, where a number of useless stats are generated for the player. Regardless, the player will become a female dwarf amazon weighing 335 lb.The player starts in an invisible maze with identical rooms, and regardless what direction the player moves, they will become lost, eventually finding themselves in a desert. After wandering aimlessly, the player will encounter several defenseless enemies which are crushed without mercy. It doesn't matter what direction the player travels, they will always encounter the same enemies, requiring them to lose combat with a lizardman, and get stomped to death by a giant chicken. The player is resurrected both times. Ultimately, the player will get slain by a zombie, and just kind of win the game.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elroy N.
