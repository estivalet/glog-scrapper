{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snack Attack", "overview": "Clearly indebted to Pac-Man, this maze-munching game updates the arcade hit's formula with a few key tweaks. You control a fish-like critter with a taste for gumdrops, attempting to advance from level to level by grabbing all the sweets. In turn, the patrolling Gumdrop Guards will do their best to curb your sugar rush. Gobbling up a magic star will temporarily equip you with a set of impressive fangs, so you can add the guards to your menu until the effect wears off. Now and then, a 'dessert' resembling a pumpkin will appear, to be collected for a score bonus. For an extra element of strategy, level layouts contain two types of doors which discriminate in granting passage: green doors allow only the player to pass; the purple ones are reserved for guards. Snack Attack features three different mazes, which cycle in groups of increasing speed and difficulty.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 10, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Illowsky", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivAZkuBbpsM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86280-snack-attack\n"}
