{"altername_name": [], "name": "Old Ironsides", "overview": "Old Ironsides is a two player game that simulates nineteenth century naval combat. The action takes place on a single screen in which each player controls a three-masted sailing vessel. The speed and movement of the ships is determined by the wind. The wind is always blowing from south to north, making southward movement difficult unless a player tacks and navigates his ship in a zigzag manner. Each ship is equipped with twelve cannons, six on each side of the ship, and a supply of powder. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing player in battle. A player loses if either their ship is sunk or if they get lost in the fog.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 26, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xerox Education", "publishers": "Xerox Education", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85413-old-ironsides\n"}
