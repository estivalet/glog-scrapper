{"altername_name": ["Fido"], "name": "Rescue Fido", "overview": "Rescue Fido is a 1 or 2 player arcade game for the Apple II. Your faithful companion FIDO has been mistaken for \"Butch Brawler\" K-9 killer. He has been taken for questioning by police GUARD robots. Because of a fatal error in the robot's Z-80 microprocessor , the robots have not only mistaked FIDO for a ruthless killer, but will get caught in a dismembering crowd control subroutine set to execute at midnight. Your mission is to fight your way through Z-80 controlled computer police weaponry to the execution station and beam FIDO to your WARRIOR ship. The player controls a small tank which can be moved in all directions, and must be positioned on the screen before each level begins. The player combats timed rounds against a number of different opponents, and their vehicle fires horizontally or vertically depending upon the level. Each level consists of a large swarm of identical enemy vessels with very different movement schemes, and if the player is hit, they lose a life, and the timer restarts. The player starts with 5 lives, and when all are lost it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Patrick Montelo", "publishers": "Homer Brothers Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx_LqfomQmA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144569-rescue-fido\n"}
