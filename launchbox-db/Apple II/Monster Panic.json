After completing an entire screen, the player advances to a more difficult challenge. The player starts with 6 lives. In Monster Manor, the player tries to collect dots in a maze while avoiding ghosts. The player can collect a special red dot that gives them a spell that can be used at any time to temporarily makes the player invulnerable to ghost attacks. There is a vulnerable bonus ghost, and the player gains a life if they collect it 5 times. The red ghost will actively hunt the player. After collecting all dots, the player moves to a new level with more or faster moving ghosts. The player starts with 3 lives. In Dungeon Panic! the player controls a rapidly moving character than can jump and climb ladders. The player can also dig holes causing enemies to fall through. The goal is to continuously climb higher to an infinite number of levels, while avoiding dangerous monsters which crawl along the ground.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114935-monster-panic\n"}
