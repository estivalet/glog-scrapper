{"altername_name": [], "name": "Number Munchers", "overview": "Number Munchers is the first educational game in the Munchers series. Designed to teach basic math skills, it was popular among American school children in the 1980s and 1990s and was the recipient of several awards. An updated 3D version, Math Munchers Deluxe, was released in 1995. Modes of Play There are 5 different modes of play in Number Munchers to advance your mathematical skills. These modes include Multiples, Factors, Primes, Equalities, and Inequalities. Multiples - The objective is to find multiples of the number given. If presented a 3, you would select numbers like 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. Factors - In this mode you find factors divisible by the number given. If the number is 12, you would choose to eat 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Primes - This mode helps you find prime numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Equality - This mode gives you the chance to find equations equaling the current number. If given the number 6, you would 'munch' 3 x 2, 3 + 3, 12 / 2, and so on. Inequality - This mode gives you the number and you must select the equations that DO NOT equal the current number. If given 6, you would eat equations such as 4 X 2, 18 / 9, and 3 + 5.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MECC", "publishers": "MECC", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Munchers", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115231-number-munchers\n"}
