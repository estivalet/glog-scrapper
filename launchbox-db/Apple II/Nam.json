{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nam", "overview": "From SSI's flyer: America's most controversial war is recreated in NAM. This tactical wargame puts you in command of American, South Vietnamese and South Korean infantry, artillery, paratroopers, marines, rangers and air cavalry in six historical operations. Patrol dense jungle. Search out and destroy the enemy in his underground strongholds. Engage in bitter street fighting in Hue during the Tet Offensive. Directed by the computer, the elusive Viet Cong and battle-hardened regulars of the North Vietnamese Army appear only to fire and move, then slip away and disappear again. In the real war, our forces were told to hold ground, to stay even. Not this time. Now, you'll be fighting to win.
