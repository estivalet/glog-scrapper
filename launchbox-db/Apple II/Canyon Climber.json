{"altername_name": [], "name": "Canyon Climber", "overview": "Obviously Donkey Kong-inspired, in Canyon Climber you try to climb to the top of the Grand Canyon, while avoiding various obstacles. There are three levels, each a single screen: In Level 1 you set bombs on each side of three bridges and then push the plunger at the top to blow them up, all while jumping or outrunning charging sheep. In Level 2 you climb ladders and run up long paths to reach the top of the screen while jumping over arrows shot by indians. In Level 3 you jump pits and climb ladders to reach the top while avoiding birds that drop bricks.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Garon", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon_Climber", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4jmDpFcK0Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115032-canyon-climber\n"}
