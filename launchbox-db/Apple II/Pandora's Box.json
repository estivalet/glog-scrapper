{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pandora's Box", "overview": "The ancient evils have escaped Pandora's Box, and you must return them from where they came. The game is divided into a split screen. On the left you can see your character, represented by a small cloud. The right side of the screen has a map, which shows your current location as well as the evils you need to destroy. You play as a small cloud which moves across an environment of graveyards, ancient ruins, forests, and lakes. The cloud can shoot lightning bolts in 1 of 8 separate directions, in the direction that the cloud last moved. Hidden about this land are a number of ancient horrors, consisting of zombies, jack-o-lanterns, snakes, and small rodents. These must be shot with your lightning bolts to return them to Pandora's Box, but are otherwise harmless. Of more danger are bats, which if they come in contact with your character, will carry them off the edge of the screen, causing the player to lose a life. The player has a total of 3 lives. When a player has destroyed all the escaped horrors on the level, they will advance to the next stage.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Flanagan", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113819-pandoras-box\n"}
