{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultima IV: Quest of The Avatar", "overview": "Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, first released in 1985 for the Apple II, is the fourth in the series of Ultima role-playing video games. It is the first in the \"Age of Enlightenment\" trilogy, shifting the series from the hack and slash, dungeon crawl gameplay of its \"Age of Darkness\" predecessors towards an ethically-nuanced, story-driven approach. In 1996 Computer Gaming World named Ultima IV as #2 on its Best Games of All Time list on the PC. Designer Richard Garriott considers this game to be among his favorites from the Ultima series. Ultima IV is among the few computer role-playing games, and perhaps the first, in which the game's story does not center on asking a player to overcome a tangible ultimate evil.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Origin Systems", "publishers": "Origin Systems", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxHDbisc0-Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83330-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar\n"}
