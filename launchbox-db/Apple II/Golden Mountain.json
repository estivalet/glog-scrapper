{"altername_name": [], "name": "Golden Mountain", "overview": "Golden Mountain is a 1-player versus computer low-res strategy game for the Apple II. A large house stands atop a mountain of precious jewels. The player and their opponent play as miners, taking turns picking precious stones from the pile. The more valuable the gemstone, the more luck that is needed to remove it without causing the entire mountain to come crashing down. The player is awarded points for the number and quality of blocks mined. If the piece which holds the house aloft becomes unstable, the entire house will come crashing down the mountain. Ultimately, the player who destroys the house, loses the game.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starcraft", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368198-golden-mountain\n"}
