{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shuffleboard", "overview": "Shuffleboard by IDSI is the computerized version of the classic game found on the decks of ocean liners as well as in your favorite tavern. This game contains all the challenge and excitement of other popular games of motion which require skill and strategy to play well. IDSI has added a new twist to Shuffleboard by allowing you to compete against your computer. You will find that your Apple can be a skillful and challenging opponent, providing you with many hours of fun and relaxation. Shuffleboard is a 1-player versus computer or 2-player shuffleboard game for the Apple II. Played from a top-down perspective, the board is divided into squares worth varying points, with a bounce board on each side. If shots are thrown too hard, they will fall off the back of the table. Two human players can challenge each other to a game of shuffleboard, and there is also a computer opponent, who has two different difficulty levels. There are two gameplay types: tally all and cutthroat. Each player gets 4 stones to throw for each game, with points awarded based upon final stone placement. Players take turns throwing the first stone. To throw a stone, the player will choose the vertical location to throw the stone from, and will also select the angle of the throw using a small indicator. The strength of the throw is determined by a rapidly oscillating display between a soft and hard throw, where the player has to shoot when the desired strength is reached. Stones will accurately bounce off of each other, and the computer automatically scores each game.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 10, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Innovative Design Software", "publishers": "Innovative Design Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86276-shuffleboard\n"}
