{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pitstop II", "overview": "Race Formula-1 in several tracks while trying to beat a computer, or human opponent. Pay attention to your fuel and tires: It will be necessary to drive into a pitstop to swap them out and refuel. Tire damage is indicated by their colour; they start off black and become lighter as they take damage. Once they have turned white a collision will send the car off the track. Six different tracks are available to race on including Brands Hatch and Vallelunga. Tracks can be played singly, or all together in a Grand Prix contest. When playing the Grand Prix this is scored in the same way as the real contest. Players can select how many laps they want to race and 3 different skill levels.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergistic Software", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373477-pitstop-ii\n"}
