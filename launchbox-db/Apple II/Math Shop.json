{"altername_name": ["The Math Shop"], "name": "Math Shop", "overview": "Children assume the role of shopkeeper, and serve customers who walk into their stores. Ten different stores are available for choosing from, with each store emphasizing a different sort of math problem. The Donut Store, for example, emphasizes fraction questions; the Boutique emphasizes practical \"cash-register\" questions; the Jewelry store emphasizes decimal additions; and the Pharmacy emphasizes percents. Children use the arrow keys to walk an animated figure around to the ten different stores on the screen. (The tacit understanding is that the animated figure represents the child/shopkeeper.) A simple press of the space bar allows the animated figure to walk into any store.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 19, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Scholastic Wizware", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114904-math-shop\n"}
