{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cubit", "overview": "\"Cubit\" is a 1983 action game developed by Edmund Pirali and published by Micromax. It requires a 48K Apple ][+, //e, //c, or IIgs. This game is a Q*bert clone. As such, the rules are similar. Change the color of the cubes, which are arranged in a large pyramid shape, by jumping on them. On the early levels, only a single jump on a cube will change it to the desired color needed to finish the level, but on later levels the cubes may need to be jumped on twice. During the game you will be chased by first by bouncing eggs, and then by the snakes that hatch from them. And during this time, you must remember to avoid jumping off the cubes to your death.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 21, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micromax Systems", "publishers": "Micromax Systems", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113916-cubit\n"}
