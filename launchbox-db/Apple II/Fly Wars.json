{"altername_name": ["Flywars", "Flywars"], "name": "Fly Wars", "overview": "In Fly Wars you play as a spider attempting to gobble as many flies and other insects as possible. The player controls, a spider which can move in the 4 cardinal directions. The player can move with or without leaving a web behind, but the goal is to trap the spiders and other insects which flit about the screen in a small web, so they can be eaten. During each life, there are a specific amount of insects on the screen. When all are eaten, the spider dies of starvation. If the player's web has extended throughout the screen, they can move onto an adjacent blank screen to consume the remaining insects. Points are awarded for insects consumed. As the spider eats more insects, they are rewarded with higher difficulty levels. On level 2, a can of bug spray will repeatedly appear on the screen to try to destroy the player. On level 3, a large red insect will try to kill the spider. The player keeps any experience levels gained throughout their 3 lives, and when all are lost it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 27, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Duane Later", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113920-fly-wars\n"}
