{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trolls and Tribulations", "overview": "You play a troll set on an expedition into cavernous sewers to retrieve valuable relics. Guarding the treasure are monsters such as cretins, buzzards, skulls and spiders. The mazes are difficult to navigate and fraught with danger. One wrong move could send you plummeting to your death. Trolls and Tribulations is a side scrolling platform game with some puzzle like mechanics due to it's unusual control scheme and movement. Most mazes begin with a barrage of cretins that must be dispatched in order to open the door to the main portion of the maze. Your character has a gun that is capable of turning the cretins into eggs. After shooting them, you must quickly shove the eggs into the sewer water as they will hatch back into cretins after a short time. Your gun has limited ammo but which can be replenished in the middle of the screen. Once the cretins have been defeated, the doors to the main portion of the maze are accessible. Here is where you will find treasures to increase your point total. The mazes require careful navigation as some treasures are placed in dangerous locations. Keys need to be recovered to open further doors allowing you to proceed to the maze's exit. Other monsters are present in this part of the maze and cannot be destroyed by your weapon. Instead it will take careful timing and jumps to avoid being killed by them.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 13, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Designer Software", "publishers": "Creative Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolls_and_Tribulations", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K89Spg5-kyU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86464-trolls-and-tribulations\n"}
