{"altername_name": [], "name": "Penny Arcade", "overview": "A collection of software for the Apple II+ straight from the manufacturer, this compilation is primarily noteworthy for including LITTLE BRICK OUT, an AppleSoft BASIC port of Steve Wozniak's earlier Integer BASIC conversion of his own uncredited Atari arcade smash hit Breakout, implementation of which drove the Apple II (and hence, its competitors like the IBM PC) to have color and sound capabilities. This particular flavour of the bounce-balls-off-paddles-to-smash-bricks game plays horizontally rather than vertically, and permits a great deal of user customization, from the colour scheme to the size of the paddle. The comp also includes the PENNY ARCADE collection of Pong-variant (bump the ball into your opponent's goal) minigames with the following playfields: Bumper Pool, Hockey, Scramble and Tennis. Also there is LEMONADE, an early implementation of the Lemonade Stand sales simulation. Other software on the compilation includes such exciting demonstration and application programs as COLOR DEMOSOFT, HOPALONG CASSIDY, PHONE LIST, BRIAN'S THEME, and RENUMBER/APPEND, as well as ALIGNMENT TEST TONE -- which is not a program at all, but, as suggested, a useful noise for hardware calibration.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Budge", "publishers": "Apple Computer", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144560-penny-arcade\n"}
