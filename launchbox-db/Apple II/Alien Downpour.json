{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Downpour", "overview": "You are Deuce Darkstar on a secret, daring, foolhearty mission to infiltrate the Domain of Shmup and stop the Alien Downpour they are preparing to rain down upon all you know and love. You know it's a suicide mission, but you eat suicide missions for breakfast and you're mighty hungry. Created to celebrate the 40th birthday of the Apple II line, Alien Downpour pays tribute to old-school shoot-'em-up action. There are sectors upon sectors of hostile space baddies to vanquish, bosses to defeat, and obstacle-course sections to test the player's agility - complete with references to fondly-remembered past games (and to Apple II history).", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 16, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Snacking On Software", "publishers": "Snacking On Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRNxcifVIyY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113704-alien-downpour\n"}
