{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crosscountry California", "overview": "The geographical educational game is set on the map of California, USA. Players drive an 18-wheel truck around the state picking up and delivering a variety of commodities with typed-in commands (TURN ON MOTOR, LOOK AT MAP, REST, REPAIR, GO TO GAS STATION, etc.). As players travel between the cities, they learn valuable skills such as problem solving, map reading, and decision making. They'll learn time management, decide when to eat and sleep, and watch road conditions based on the weather, season, and climate. Once all necessary commodities are collected and destination is reached, the scenario is treated as successfully completed.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 18, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Didatech Software", "publishers": "Didatech Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114863-crosscountry-california\n"}
