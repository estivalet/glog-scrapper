{"altername_name": [], "name": "Operation Mercury", "overview": "July 1941: somewhere in the north of Brazil, British secret service agents note an increase in enemy maritime traffic. In the port of Recife, boats carry tons of equipment: boxes, metal beams, etc. The reason for these activities is clear: the enemy is building a huge submarine base! An ultra-confidential file on this subject has been compiled by the British agents. Unfortunately, the bag containing the precious documents is on Ascension Island, and the ship that was to collect it has been sunk. That's when you come on the scene: you are given command of the PYGGY, a small English submarine of 68 meters. Your mission is to locate the enemy base and bring the bag ... Operation Mercury is both an adventure and simulation game. Many parameters come into play randomly during the game: weather, crew behavior, ship traffic, etc. Your sagacity will be put to the test to reach the end of the mission!", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125963-operation-mercury\n"}
