As with Battlefront the command scale is at the corps-level. The battle system incorporates the factors of adverse weather and terrain, supply, experience and morale. A complete range of unit types is provided. Victory depends on seizing the key locations within the turn limit.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 27, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Studies Group", "publishers": "Strategic Studies Group", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85529-rommel-battles-for-north-africa\n"}
