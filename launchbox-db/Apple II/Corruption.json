The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Magnetic Scolls", "publishers": "Rainbird", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371865-corruption\n"}
