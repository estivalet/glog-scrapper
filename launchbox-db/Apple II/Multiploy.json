{"altername_name": [], "name": "Multiploy", "overview": "Multiploy is an educational game for the Apple II. The player controls a small turret in the bottom center of the screen, as mathematical equations rain from above. The player must quickly type in the answers to the questions, and if they type a correct answer, their turret blasts the equation. If the player is too slow, the pieces get close to the turret and fire back, destroying the player. The player receives a score based upon how well they answer questions. The player can choose from 3 difficulty levels, and can perform addition, subtraction, multiplications, and division questions.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Coletta", "publishers": "Reston Publishing Company", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113797-multiploy\n"}
