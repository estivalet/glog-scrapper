{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Caverns of Mordia", "overview": "The Caverns of Mordia is an early attempt at a D&D style game. Using a text interface, the game consists of moving between rooms and levels of a dungeon. Rooms can contain monsters, hazards, and other items. Occasionally there is animation done using ascii art. The game has RPG elements - you gain gold and experience and can increase in strength and agility as well as finding better weapons and armour. Also, the caverns are randomly generated - it is quite rogue-like, though there is never a graphical representation of the cavern layout. It is more akin to a text adventure where you are told which rooms you can get to from your current room.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "April 21, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Lothlorien Farming", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113898-the-caverns-of-mordia\n"}
