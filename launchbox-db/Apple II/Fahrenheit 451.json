Originally released by software company Trillium, it was re-released in 1985 under the company name's new name Telarium. The player's goal is to help Guy Montag, the main character from the novel, to evade the authorities and make contact with an underground movement. As Bradbury himself contributed to the game,[1] such as by writing the prologue and responses of the game's intelligent computer \"Ray\",[2] it can be played as at least a semi-canonical sequel to the original novel. Montag is also helped by Clarisse.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 10, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Trillium", "publishers": "Trillium", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84756-fahrenheit-451\n"}
