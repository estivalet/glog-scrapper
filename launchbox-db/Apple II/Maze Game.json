{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Game", "overview": "An early Silas Warner (Castle Wolfenstein, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein) creation which helped pioneer the 3D first-person perspective in home computer games, much like Escape (with its nearly identical display). The computer generates a maze of user-definable size (3 to 18 tiles in each dimension), and shows you an overhead map; then you're thrown into the 3D view where you try to successfully traverse it. Some additional features can be toggled - the ability to consult the map at any time, a compass to get your bearings, and leaving tracks on the floor behind you. This was Warner's second home computer game after 1977's Robot War, prior to that he was developing games for terminal systems.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "December 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Muse Software", "publishers": "Muse Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112567-maze-game\n"}
