The goal is to chase Rumpelstiltskin away by correctly and quickly answering logic questions. The player is briefly shown a 5 character digit. The player must retype it, or make rearrangements to the characters based upon the challenge. As the player answers questions, they refill the letters for the name Rumpelstiltskin.
