{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strategic Conquest", "overview": "Strategic Conquest is a two-player turn-based strategy game for the Apple II and Apple Macintosh, based on the wargame Empire. It was published by PBI Software and the Macintosh version was continued by Delta Tao Software. Strategic Conquest is a military themed 1 - 2 player strategy game with the goal to conquer the world. It is a modified version of the classic Empire. The players compete to control a map of randomly placed islands in a grid, with the player who eliminates the other being declared the winner. This is accomplished by attacking and taking over enemy and neutral cities scattered around the map. Each player starts with one city, which can produce a variety of unique units including army, fighter, destroyer, submarine, transport, carrier, battleship, and bomber. Each unit takes a different number of days to produce, and units have individual strengths, weaknesses, and movement abilities. A fog of war is in place, and at the beginning of each game the player only knows the surrounding terrain. Enemy units can't be seen unless close to the player. The game allows for 1-player versus computer, 2-player, and 2-player games via AppleTalk. Computer difficulty ranges from 1 - 15, with the levels from 10 and up slowing the player's production speeds to make the computer have more units.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Delta Tao Software", "publishers": "Delta Tao Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113853-strategic-conquest\n"}
