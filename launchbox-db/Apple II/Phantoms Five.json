{"altername_name": [], "name": "Phantoms Five", "overview": "Phantoms Five is a vertically scrolling action game where the player controls a plane and has to bomb various targets beneath him. The plane is set on auto-pilot and moves automatically forward with the player only controlling the horizontal movement with a paddle. Points are earned for successfully hitting targets such as headquarters, fuel dumps, post offices and roads. There are also some targets to avoid such as red cross hospitals and prisoners of war camps. Hitting these will lead to a loss of points. At the same time the player has to watch out for fire from anti-aircraft guns. Getting hit will lead to a loss of a life and a restart at a lower level. At times the player will encounter enemy fighter planes. The game then switches to a first person perspective where the player aims left and right with the paddle and has to shoot down the fighters with the machine gun before they shoot down him.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 26, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnThjBcOuSE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85431-phantoms-five\n"}
