{"altername_name": [], "name": "Transylvania", "overview": "In an adventure game you are put in a fictitious world inside the computer. The computer shows you where you are, what you see, and where you can go. You travel around and do things by giving the computer two word commands, a verb and a noun, such as \"Go North\", \"Look Tree\", \"Take Brick\", and so on. The computer then shows you the result of your action and waits for your next instruction. The object of an adventure game is to accomplish something in particular through exploring the world around you, perhaps using some of the objects you find, and solving puzzles. This \"something\" in Transylvania is to rescue a damsel in distress... but first you must find her.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Penguin Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania_(series)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1cRpql7XlI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40863-transylvania\n"}
