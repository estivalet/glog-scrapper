{"altername_name": [], "name": "Torpedo Fire", "overview": "Torpedo Fire is a turn-based tactical game of WW2 naval warfare focused on submarine vs. destroyer combat. The player may take the role of either a submarine commander or a destroyer captain in any side of the conflict, while at the same time send orders to other ships in the player's command. The game allows playing against a fellow player (hot-seat multiplayer) or the computer AI in turns that simulate 60 minutes of actual combat. The game features different interfaces for the sub and destroyer players (a periscope interface for the sub and a radar/sonar screen for the destroyer) and comes with a single introductory mission to hone your skills. The game nonetheless includes a hefty database of ships and weapons which can be put to use in the included SSI Shipyard program that allows the player to design campaigns and scenarios.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 13, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86459-torpedo-fire\n"}
