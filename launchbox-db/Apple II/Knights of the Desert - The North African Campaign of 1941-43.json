{"altername_name": ["Knights of the Desert"], "name": "Knights of the Desert: The North African Campaign of 1941-43", "overview": "Knights of the Desert is a 1983 Turn-based strategy video game developed by Tactical Design Group and published by Strategic Simulations for the Apple II series, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, MS-DOS and TRS-80. It is based on the 1940-43 North African campaign. Players have the option to play set pieces of the campaign or the entire campaign as a theatre commander. For example, players can play as either the Axis or Allies in 1941 when Rommel bypassed Tobruk or again in 1942 when he had captured it or on the eve of El Alamein. Limited in scope and playability (the map only stretched from western Libya to Alexandria), the game did not involve the forces of Operation Torch (United States and allied French) in 1943.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 19, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tactical Design Group", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_the_Desert", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85147-knights-of-the-desert-the-north-african-campaign-of-1941-43\n"}
