{"altername_name": ["Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony"], "name": "Moebius", "overview": "Khantun is traditionally a peaceful land, with no army or wars. Former leader Kaimen has turned to using his powers for evil, and the land has not withstood his aggression. The Holy Ones have been kidnapped, the land instead ruled by an evil group of monks. It is down to the player to vanquish Kaimen and restore the path of righteousness. The game combines top-viewed role playing elements with combat action. The player explores the lands, but when encountering unfriendly people the player must fight, using swords or martial arts moves, as well as long-range missiles and magical powers.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 24, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Origin Systems", "publishers": "Origin Systems", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moebius:_The_Orb_of_Celestial_Harmony", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85339-moebius\n"}
