{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Cosmic Balance", "overview": "This video game is a computerized turn-based version of tactical combat simulation very similar to the Star Fleet Battles pen-paper-map-counter game. While Star Fleet Battles is explicitly set in the Star Trek universe, The Cosmic Balance is not. That said, the first (and closest to a tutorial) scenario in the game re-creates a meeting between Starship Enterprise and USS Reliant, like in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Ship design is an exercise in resource management, with power, drives, defensive systems, and weapons all vying for a finite amount of hull space.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 4, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84358-the-cosmic-balance\n"}
