{"altername_name": ["Tumble Bugs"], "name": "Dung Beetles", "overview": "AKA \"Tumble Bugs\" in a later release. Dung Beetles is an Apple II computer game by Bob Bishop released in 1982 by Datasoft. The game was ported to Atari 8-bit computers, and also to the TRS-80 Color Computer, where it was distributed by Tandy. On the Color Computer, it was renamed Mega-Bug; however, some copies were sold as Dung Beetles. Later versions for both the Apple II and Atari were named Tumble Bugs; also the Atari version was renamed Magneto Bugs for the 1983 re-release by Gentry Software. In Australia, the game was re-branded Bug Attack. Sneak through unique maze after maze gobbling white dots while being hunted by the Mega-Bugs. Their job is made easier because The Mouth you pilot leaves behind a trail of colored dots which they will follow relentlessly the moment they come upon it. This makes the maze's dead-ends truly treacherous. Your job is made harder by the size of the maze (20x20), which requires a magnifier over your location to show the action, effectively creating a blind spot at a radius of three dots around you. To succeed, you must watch not only where you're going, but scan each randomly generated maze to plan your route and avoid the Mega-Bugs. If you do succeed, you're rewarded with a new maze and an additional Mega-Bug hunting you. If you fail, the bugs dance gleefully and shout, \"we gotcha!\"", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Bishop", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dung_Beetles_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlIxErE8Pgs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83914-dung-beetles\n"}
