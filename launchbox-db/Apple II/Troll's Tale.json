{"altername_name": [], "name": "Troll's Tale", "overview": "Troll's Tale is an adventure video game developed in 1983 by Sunnyside Soft and published by Sierra On-Line for the Apple II. It uses the same engine for Sunnysoft's earlier game Dragon's Keep. Sierra acquired the game from Sunnysoft, along with Dragon's Keep and Bop-A-Bet by April and appointed Nancy Anderton to manage the publishing of their educational games. Peter Oliphant worked on the conversions of the game for the Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64 and DOS. Coleco made a deal with Sierra planning to release the game on ColecoVision with a Super Game Module. The game came packaged with a paper map, showing an incomplete layout of the game and stickers to mark the treasure locations.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sunnyside Soft", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113864-trolls-tale\n"}
