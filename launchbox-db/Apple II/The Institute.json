{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Institute", "overview": "The Institute is a 1983 graphic adventure game released for the TRS-80, Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit family by Screenplay. The user navigates their character through a graph of rooms by entering commands with the keyboard: \"N\", \"W\", \"S\", and \"E\" are used to move respectively north, west, south, and east; simple text commands to interact and investigate objects within the rooms such as \"open door\" are also used. The game's protagonist is a mental patient trying to escape from the institute (hence the title). A good deal of the game takes place in drug-induced hallucinations, though in some versions the drug is a \"strange powder\" that sends you into \"dreams\".", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 18, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Screenplay", "publishers": "Screenplay", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85091-the-institute\n"}
