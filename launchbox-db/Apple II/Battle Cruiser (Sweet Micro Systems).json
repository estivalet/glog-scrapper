{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Cruiser (Sweet Micro Systems)", "overview": "Not to be confused with the strategy game from Strategic Simulations of the same name, Battle Cruiser is a 1-player science-fiction themed arcade shooter for the Apple II. The player controls a spaceship that must travel through tunnels engaging a number of alien craft which appear from the front. A small alien vessel which tracks the player will intermittently appear from behind, complicating movements. The player has limited fuel resources, and must pick up fuel tanks every level, or their ship will be destroyed by running out of energy. As the player reaches more difficult levels, they begin to encounter lasers firing from the sides of the screen, enemy vessels that fire upon the player, and barricades blocking the tunnels which must be shot and destroyed. At the end of each section, the player is rewarded points for fuel and number of vessels remaining. The player has a total of 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over. The game appears to have been shipped as part of the Mockingboard \"C\" audio card from Sweet Micro Systems System.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Hammond", "publishers": "Sweet Micro Systems", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152268-battle-cruiser-sweet-micro-systems\n"}
