{"altername_name": [], "name": "Think Quick!", "overview": "A dragon has taken over the Castle of Mystikar. To defeat the dragon, you must find the parts to build an enchanted knight which are spread throughout the castle. Numerous locked doors, many of which need to be opened in the proper order, block passageways. Roaming the halls are numerous slime worms, who will swallow you whole or fall asleep if you can feed them some flowers first. From any of the castle rooms you can access your hideout, which allows you to store useful items and clues you may find, and also pause the game. Each section of the castle has a time limit, and gets progressively harder. A castle builder is also included allowing players to create their own maze and puzzles.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 19, 1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "The Learning Company", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115697-think-quick\n"}
