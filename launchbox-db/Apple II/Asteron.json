Like in any other version of the game the player controls a space craft that uses a thrust control to move around and can rotate and shoot in any direction. Asteroids that are shot spilt into smaller parts until they have completely been destroyed. After a while the Asterons will send a flying saucer that attempts to attack the player. The game can be played with either paddle or keyboard. The player has three lives and when they have been used up the game is over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Murray Peterson", "publishers": "Western MicroData", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87695-asteron\n"}
