{"altername_name": [], "name": "MicroLeague Baseball", "overview": "Micro League Baseball is a 1984 baseball simulation video game. It was developed by Micro League Sports Association and published by Micro League Multimedia Inc. It was released on Amiga, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and PC. It was one of the first video games to carry the Major League Baseball license, allowing the game to feature MLB teams. It also carried the Major League Baseball Players Association license, allowing the game to use real players. A general manager disk available separately allowed users to make trades with other teams or create their own players. A stat compiler disk allowed players to save the results of every played game and compile statistics for each player, allowing users to play an entire season. The game was unique for its time for its concentration on management. Things like batter stance and fielder placement were all possible for the first time in a licensed baseball game. The original game came with a variety of all-time great teams, including the 1927 New York Yankees, 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, 1961 New York Yankees, 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers, 1967 St. Louis Cardinals, 1968 Detroit Tigers, 1969 New York Mets, 1970 Baltimore Orioles, 1973 Oakland Athletics, 1975 Cincinnati Reds, 1975 Boston Red Sox, 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates, 1980 Philadelphia Phillies, 1980 Kansas City Royals and the 1982 Milwaukee Brewers.
