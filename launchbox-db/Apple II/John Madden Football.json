{"altername_name": [], "name": "John Madden Football", "overview": "John Madden Football is a football video game following the success of Earl Weaver Baseball. This video game is the first of the Madden football games developed and released by Electronic Arts. It features John Madden on the cover. This game featured many customizable aspects including weather conditions (hot, rain, snow, or cold and windy), time of quarters (8, 10, 12 or 15 minutes), player fatigue, player injuries, and penalties. Unlike future Madden football video games, this version does not feature season play, only single games, and no actual NFL teams are included due to the lack of NFL or NFLPA licenses for authentic teams, player names, and stadiums. However, some of the teams are based on real teams. One could also create a team from scratch in this game. It is the only Madden game to be released for the Commodore and the Apple II.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Madden_Football_(1988_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82689-john-madden-football\n"}
