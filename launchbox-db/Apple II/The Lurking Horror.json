{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Lurking Horror", "overview": "Despite a terrible snowstorm, a young G.U.E. Tech student travels to the school's computer lab to work on his grad paper. However, something strange has happened. The file containing the student's document has been partially overwritten by the Department of Alchemy's files. At first the student's only goal is to retrieve his lost document, but soon he realizes that something far more sinister is occurring in the depths of the school building. The Lurking Horror is Infocom's only horror-themed text adventure game. The game is set in the haunted school building, in the midst of a blizzard that rendered escape impossible. The player explores the environments and has to solve puzzles to overcome obstacles. There are hostile creatures in the game, most of which must be defeated or outsmarted by using specific items. While not a direct adaption of his stories, the game itself was heavily inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 23, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infocom", "publishers": "Infocom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lurking_Horror", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85282-the-lurking-horror\n"}
