{"altername_name": [], "name": "I, Damiano: The Wizard of Partestrada", "overview": "An interactive fiction game based on a Bantam fantasy novel by R.A. MacAvoy, this was released at a time when book publishers were dipping their toes into the text adventure game market. You play as a young warlock named Damiano Delstrego in a fantastical version of the Italian Renaissance. The angel Raphael gives you lute lessons, while his evil brother Lucifer plans the downfall of your city Partestrada where the villainous General Pardo is about to start a bloody war. Your goal is to find a sacred stone which contains the secret of life in order to save the city. Through the text parser, you type in your actions and your talking dog sidekick who calls you \"Master\" will give you feedback and hints on your progress. Through a good-evil meter at the top of the screen, you can measure how honorably you are acting or whether you have to resort to accepting Lucifer's help.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagic", "publishers": "Bantam Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85085-i-damiano-the-wizard-of-partestrada\n"}
