{"altername_name": [], "name": "Up 'n Down", "overview": "Up'n Down is an arcade game developed by Sega and released for the Sega System 1 in 1983. In the West, the arcade game was distributed by Bally Midway. In Up'n Down, the player drives a car down a series of diagonal roads attempting to avoid other cars while collecting coloured flags. To make things difficult, the cars' speeds are affected when travelling up hills, and the player must accelerate/decelerate at the right times to make sure he/she does not get hit. The map will loop until all the flags have been collected.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up%27n_Down", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83516-up-n-down\n"}
