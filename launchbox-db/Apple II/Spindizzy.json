{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spindizzy", "overview": "Spindizzy is an isometric computer game released for several 8-bit home computer formats in 1986 by Electric Dreams Software. It features action and puzzle game elements. Players must navigate a series of screens to explore a landscape suspended in a dimensional space. Development was headed by Paul Shirley, who drew inspiration from Ultimate Play the Game games that feature an isometric projection. The game was successful in the United Kingdom and was well received by the video game press. Reviewers praised its visuals and design, but criticized its audio. Similarities were drawn to Marble Madness, which was released in arcades two years earlier. Spindizzy was followed by a 1990s sequel titled Spindizzy Worlds.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 10, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electric Dreams Software", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindizzy", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_5koyIbyOk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86301-spindizzy\n"}
