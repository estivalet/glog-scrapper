{"altername_name": ["Europe Ablaze"], "name": "Europe Ablaze: The Air War Over England and Germany 1939-1945", "overview": "Europe Ablaze puts hundreds of planes at your command to send out over the deadly skies of Britain, France, and Germany during World War II. Take the place of Reichsmarschall Goering or Air Chief Marshal Portal to plot campaign-wide priorities and set the tactical doctrines your fleet commanders must follow. Then sit back and helplessly watch the events of the day take their course: the successes, the devastation, and lost planes tallied for you tersely at the end of each day, like a report card on which the fate of your nation depends. If that's too much responsibility and not enough action, the role of fleet commander is available, too. To warm this seat, you need some real knowledge of air strategy. Plan night and day missions, approach vectors, and rendezvous. Balance wear and tear on your squadrons with the demands of your commander-in-chief. Select targets that maximize each squadron's skills and planes, but keep abreast of enemy flight paths -- your opponent has plans of his own", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 8, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Studies Group", "publishers": "Strategic Studies Group", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84673-europe-ablaze-the-air-war-over-england-and-germany-1939-1945\n"}
