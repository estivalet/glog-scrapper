Dungeon Campaign is a basic fantasy dungeon crawl that doesn't even care about a background story -- enter dungeon, slay monsters, amass treasures, find exit.

Unusual is that you do not control a single character, but rather a fighting force of 25 men -- who, effectively, represent your \"hit points\".", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "December 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergistic Software", "publishers": "Synergistic Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xY7bZJ1LOQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83915-dungeon-campaign\n"}
