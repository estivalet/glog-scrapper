{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Treehouse", "overview": "The Treehouse is an educational point-and-click personal computer game developed for MS-DOS and then ported to Macintosh and the FM Towns, with Windows versions arriving later. Following the success of The Playroom, Broderbund created The Treehouse, which provides more content and furthers the user's ability to explore. First released in 1991, most copies were sold in educational supply stores rather than mainstream stores that sold computer software; it included a sing-along cassette tape. It was re-released in 1996 for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. Although the Windows version has the same general activities, the characters, interface, and locations are different.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treehouse_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115709-the-treehouse\n"}
