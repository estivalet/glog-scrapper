{"altername_name": [], "name": "Southern Command", "overview": "A wargame simulating a specific battle during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, with hexes and unit statistics like a paper wargame plus a more detailed combat resolution system taking advantage of the computer's number-crunching abilities. The human player controlled the Israeli forces, while the computer controlled the Arab ones. Like many paper wargames, the disparity of forces was balanced by the victory conditions and the rules of engagement - for example, Israeli units could not cross the border before an Arab unit had done so, and still gain the highest victory level.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 10, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86288-southern-command\n"}
