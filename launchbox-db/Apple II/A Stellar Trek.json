The player controls all ship functions, including: movement via warp and impulse engines, use of starship weaponry, maintenance of energy reserves, and repair of incurred damage. The player has access to short ranges scanners which investigate the nearby sectors and long range scanners that provide limited information on surrounding quadrants.
