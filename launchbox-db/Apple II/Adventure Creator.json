{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventure Creator", "overview": "Accept the challenge: Create your own adventure fantasy. If you've ever dreamed of designing your own computer adventure game, pinch yourself. You are not dreaming now. You are holding in your hands Adventure Creator, a remarkably sophisticated software program that can make your dream a reality. Adventure Creator is, quite simply, everything you need to design a challenging adventure game for you to enjoy- or a friend to attempt. Start by building an adventure-world: up to 100 rooms are at your disposal. Make them as perilous as you please. Build complex mazes. Booby-trap them with heat bars and populate them with ferocious and friendly creatures. Hide the treasures cleverly. Use every trick in the program to make the quest a difficult one. Once the environment is prepared, the quest is on. Either you or a friend must use cunning and skill to explore the rooms, navigate hazards, outwit creatures, and emerge victorious, laden with treasure. You may also choose to let the computer design the adventure for you. Just collect your supplies- a creature detector, time nullifier, energy points, and more- and you're off on you quest! Any way you play it, you'll find Adventure Creator complex, creative, challenging- and utterly addictive.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spinnaker Software", "publishers": "Spinnaker Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87680-adventure-creator\n"}
