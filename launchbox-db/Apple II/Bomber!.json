{"altername_name": ["Bomber"], "name": "Bomber!", "overview": "By Bob Bishop. Somehow Bob coaxed more out of an Apple II initially than anybody else knew how to do. He was a real innovator. This is a good program to showcase his skill. You're flying in a plane at the top of the screen, and hit the space bar to drop a bomb down on to the enemy tank. It's all a timed shooter game - much like Canyon Bomber by Atari... but it's also remarkable how smooth the animation is for the original Apple 2. This is a tough game to get working... I had to load off a cassette after about the 1 minute mark, but finally loaded properly. I think it only works on original Apple II as well - as slight variations on future models seem to make the program stop right as the game gets going. In any case, I scored 8 tanks with 15 bombs - not as easy as it looks, but pretty fun!", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 23, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Bishop", "publishers": "Softape", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125887-bomber\n"}
