The player controls a warrior who has found himself on the bottom of a 100 level dungeon with the goal to escape to the surface. The player can start at any with a corresponding increase in difficulty. The player must navigate through the maze and defeat all enemies in each room of the dungeon to reveal the staircase to the next level up. Gameplay is from a top-down perspective as the player navigates the maze. The player can carry 6 items at a time. The player can be armed with a sword or axe, and also has armor. Axes have a higher offensive value, while swords provide some defense. Weapons and armor can intermittently break, leaving the player armed only with their fists. As the player explores, they upgrade the weapons modifier of their weapons by finding better equipment. The player can also find magic scrolls, including: find treasure, create door, lightning bolt, heal, magic defense, protection, alter, gate, charm, death, power, and view staircase. The player must also combat a large variety of monsters, which are displayed in the bottom right of the screen. During combat, which the player can flee, the player and their assailant take turns swinging at each other as their hitpoints decrease. Dungeon levels can be randomized, or follow a standard pattern. It is possible to save and reload a game in progress.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gerhardt Software", "publishers": "Gerhardt Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167554-warriors-realm\n"}
