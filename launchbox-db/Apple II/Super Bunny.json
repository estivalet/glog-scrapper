{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Bunny", "overview": "Super Bunny is a 1983 computer game for the Apple II family of computers, written by Vic Leone and published by Datamost. The player starts as a defenseless rabbit, hopping from the left side of the screen to the right on scrolling platforms. The goal is to avoid the creatures that appear on the platforms and reach the carrot at the right side of the screen. Landing on (\"eating\") the carrot turns the rabbit into Super Bunny, at which point he must return to the starting position, dispatching creatures and earning points. The game has a different saying and song for each level (e.g., \"crunch those critters\" and the song Here Comes Peter Cottontail!). Super Bunny is credited in the game's splash screen as Reginald Rabbit.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 11, 1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Datamost, Inc.", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86353-super-bunny\n"}
