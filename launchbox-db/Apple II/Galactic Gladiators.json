{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galactic Gladiators", "overview": "Released as part of SSI's \"RapidFire\" line of sci-fi games, Tom Reamy's Galactic Gladiators is a four-on-four tactical combat jam set in the 30th century. Armed with laser weapons and special powers, teams consist of more than a dozen species with different abilities. There are humans, Denebian Slime Devils, Wodanites with their Viking horns, mysterious Zorcons, and mutants with a killing touch. You can play on large or small maps on a variety of planets. After giving your team its orders, you wait for the slow Apple II AI to similarly brief its troops, and then watch as both sides go into action.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 13, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rapid Fire", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Gladiators", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84888-galactic-gladiators\n"}
