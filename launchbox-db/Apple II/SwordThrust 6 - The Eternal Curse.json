{"altername_name": [], "name": "SwordThrust 6: The Eternal Curse", "overview": "Few buildings have a more evil reputation than the castle of Baron Ty me. Listen to the oldest legends known in the nearby villages and you will see how the castle looms large in them. The castle holds the villages in a grip of fear, demanding daily offerings that none dare refuse to give. No one alive has ever seen any moving creature around the castle, yet something takes in the offered gifts at night, and men speak quietly of inhuman monsters that have boiled out of the building in years past. The few fools who have dared enter the castle have never returned . One night you lay in your bed, sleeping . Suddenly a spectre disturbed your slumber. It told you that its body was being held captive in the castle of Baron Tyme , and it laid upon you the responsibility to free it. The Code of the Guild required you to try, and so you set out for the castle the next morning . Will you succeed where so many have failed , or will the Eternal Curse claim another victim?", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "June 12, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ace Software", "publishers": "Ace Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116269-swordthrust-6-the-eternal-curse\n"}
