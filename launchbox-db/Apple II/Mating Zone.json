{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mating Zone", "overview": "Mating Zone is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the aliens mate and breed new aliens. The initial aliens are impotent and not dangerous nor worth any points. They move from the sides of the screen towards the mating zone in the center where they mate with each other. The two will then be joined together and after leaving the zone they will start shooting and move downwards. When an alien reaches the bottom it will give birth to a second alien. These ones are harder to kill but they are also worth more points. When fertile aliens of different sorts meet they turn into an egg which will explode within a few seconds and send deadly eggshells across the screen. Aliens that manage to make four trips to the ground mutate and will then be able to shoot more and travel further. Each level has fifteen aliens. The first level has only one mating zone but later levels will have several and therefore allow aliens to spawn from larger spaces.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 23, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datamost", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85292-mating-zone\n"}
