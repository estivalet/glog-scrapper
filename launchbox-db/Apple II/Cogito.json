{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cogito", "overview": "Cogito! is a 2-player board game for the Apple II based upon buying and selling property. Two players move about a 7 x 5 board, and start with $50,000 each. Each player starts in opposing corners, and on each turn can move 2 - 6 spaces up, down, left, or right. As the player moves, each empty space they land on is put up for sale in a blind auction, and players can bid 0 to $15,000 for each property, with the highest bidder winning the site. The first player to own 15 sites receives $2500. When the player moves onto their own property, they gain $500, but every third time they do this, the property becomes available for auction again. If the player moves onto an opponent's property, they must pay $1000, and the player gains $2000 if they land on the smiley face square. There is a skull square which moves about the board 1 square at a time, and the player who lands on the skull or has it land on them loses. Also, if a player runs out of money, they lose.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Reader's Digest Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114914-cogito\n"}
