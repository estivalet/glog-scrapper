{"altername_name": ["Queen of Phobos"], "name": "The Queen of Phobos", "overview": "Queen of Phobos is a science fiction themed adventure game for the Apple II. Two weeks ago, the derelict Martian starliner \"Queen of Phobos\" was found orbiting one of the moons of Scalus III. This vessel was believed to be carrying the Martian pharaoh Rahnk III, when it disappeared near the Triffid Nebula around 9450 B.C. It was believed that Rahnk III had the famed mask of Kuh-Thu-Lu with him when the ship disappeared, an artifact believed to be the source of the Empire of Mars' power. You play as a representative of the Federation of Planets, who has been tasked with salvaging the mask from the derelict vessel. Unfortunately, four ruthless thieves have also heard rumors of the mask, and have slipped onto the vessel to try to loot the mask before you. Queen of Phobos is a graphical adventure game played via typing VERB NOUN commands. All graphics are displayed using black and white line graphics. The player must evade, and ultimately kill the four looters on the ship: Dr. Hunter, Joe from Chicago, Yuggoth, and a Geuse Beetle. Each looter requires a special weapon or item to destroy them. Item locations are randomized each game, requiring the player to explore the entire ship. The player must descend to the surface of Scalus III to gather clues, and ultimately must outsmart Martian security and obtain the famed mask. Then, with mask in hand, the player can escape from the Queen of Phobos.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William R.
