{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyclod", "overview": "In Cyclod you play as an eyeball with green legs, whose job is to smash snakes with blocks. The Cyclod plays is in a fixed playing field that does not change between levels. Snakes appear, which randomly move through the level, and the player must push movable pink blocks onto the snakes to destroy them. If the Cyclod is touched by a snake, they will lose a life. The player is rewarded points based upon number of snakes destroyed, with more points gained/snake on higher difficulty levels. There are a total of 20 difficulty levels to choose from, which control snake speed and rate of appearance. After level 7, the player receives a small animation between each level. The player has a total of 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96090-cyclod\n"}
