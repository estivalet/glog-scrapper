{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blitzkrieg", "overview": "Blitzkrieg is a shooting game where the player controls an anti aircraft turret that is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. Above the cannon numerous air planes move past from both directions and the player's task is to shoot down as many as possible before they can escape. The aiming is similar to an artillery game with the player choosing the angle and the bullets will then fly in a trajectory until hitting an enemy or the ground. There are four different enemy planes (small, medium, big and bombers) and the game keeps track of how many has been destroyed and how many have escaped. The cannon has a limited amount of ammunition and the game ends when it has depleted.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "July 31, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Cross", "publishers": "Programma International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PrCl1MDGXA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84163-blitzkrieg\n"}
