{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Quarks", "overview": "Space Quarks is a fixed-screen shooter for the home computer. The game is very similar to arcade classics like Space Invaders, Galaxian and Galaga. The player controls a tank, which can move left and right across the bottom of the screen. Fire missiles at the alien invaders flying overhead in a variety of formations and patterns. But watch out... after you start shooting and hitting targets, you can bet those aliens will start firing back! Clearing levels leads to more lives (\"tanks\"), more points added onto your score, and, of course, even more levels of aliens to clear.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96749-space-quarks\n"}
