{"altername_name": ["Snoggle"], "name": "Sn\u00f8ggle", "overview": "You are Snoggle, winding your way through a maze of ghosts who will eat you if they catch you. You have to be quick, you need to be bold, but if you are not cool and intelligent you\u2019re dead. When you are cornered you may try to reach one of your four energizers, which give you power over the ghosts for five seconds, during which you must make your escape. But don\u2019t squander them, for there is no place to hide from a ghost. A combination action-strategy game written in machine language, with hi-res graphics. Eight levels of play. Keyboard controlled. Warning!! The upper levels of this game (levels 2-8) are extremely difficult to reach without extraordinary reflexes and cunning. If you are frustrated by programs not easily mastered, don\u2019t buy this program!", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "February 28, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Star Craft", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126217-snoggle\n"}
