{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kermit\u2019s Electronic Story Maker", "overview": "Kermit's Electronic StoryMaker is a video game/book set that was made for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in 1984. In the game, the player puts together a story using the words in the book. The player's choices then come to life as an animated story. Simon & Schuster also published a companion game under the Muppet Institute of Technology banner, The Great Gonzo in WordRider. A New York Times article described the game: \"The Muppets of the television show -- Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, the whole gang -- act out sentences that the child at the computer console constructs, using the program's vocabulary. No matter how ridiculous, if it's grammatically correct, they'll oblige.\" The illustrations in the instruction book are by Guy Gilchrist, who drew the Muppets comic strip from 1981 to 1986. The game's music featured a rendition of the Muppet Show's theme song.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126152-kermits-electronic-story-maker\n"}
