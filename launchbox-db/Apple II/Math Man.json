{"altername_name": [], "name": "Math Man", "overview": "Math Man is an educational arcade game for the Apple II. Designed to teach basic math, there are 10 levels of increasing difficulty math problems. The player must move a character through a series of platforms and ladders containing tokens that either add or subtract numbers from an existing score on the top of the screen. The player's goal is to reach a specific number. They must accomplish this task before a bucket being hoisted on the right side of the screen reaches its zenith, and floods the entire maze, causing the player to lose a life. The player has a total of 3 lives, and each remaining life must finish the level to move onto the next. There are 4 levels of character movement speed available. There is also an option to practice math without the arcade component.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 14, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Applied Systems Knowledge", "publishers": "Scholastic", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115569-math-man\n"}
