{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spectre", "overview": "You've been marooned between the stars, and the deadly Questers are storming into your ship. Your job is to defeat the onslaught before your ship is destroyed. Players are presented with a split-screen view which contains a 3-dimensional maze view on the left, and a corresponding bird's eye view on the right. The player's goal is to navigate the entire maze and gather all the pellets on the ground. Complicating this are the aforementioned Questers, which will cause the player to lose a life if they come in contact. The player has a total of 3 lives, and then it's game over. A player can escape the Questers by hiding in the air vents of the ship, which randomly moves them within the stage. When the player collects all pellets, they will advance to the next stage.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "September 10, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datamost, Inc.", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86294-spectre\n"}
