{"altername_name": [], "name": "Epoch", "overview": "Epoch puts one player in control of a spacecraft with the goal to destroy as many aliens as possible before running out of either time, ammunition or fuel. The game is viewed from a first person perspective, the player flies through the darkness of space trying to place crosshairs so targets can get hit with the weapon of his ship. There are four different types of alien ships and two different alien bases, each giving a different score when destroyed. Friendly bases can be used for rearming and refueling, while time can be regained by entering time portals and flying down the time corridors that appear.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 8, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84668-epoch\n"}
