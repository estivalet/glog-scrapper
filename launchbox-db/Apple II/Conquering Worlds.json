{"altername_name": [], "name": "Conquering Worlds", "overview": "Conquering Worlds is a space-based strategy game for 1 - 4 players involving planetary exploration and conquest. The player and their opponents control a series of planets within a galaxy containing 4 - 32 star systems, which are represented by planets rapidly orbiting a central sun. Each turn is timed to 120 seconds, and the player must command as many troop actions as possible during this time. Troops orders are placed by sending troops in a direction, and they will arrive at whatever body lies that way. There are two routes to victory: Destroying all enemies, or conquering all planets. When a player tries to invade an occupied planet, they are presented with a mini-game where they and their opponent take turns moving a series of lasers that run laterally across the screen. The goal is to shoot as many of the rapidly moving enemy's vessels as possible in a limited time period.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 4, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datamost", "publishers": "Datamost", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquering_Worlds", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84354-conquering-worlds\n"}
