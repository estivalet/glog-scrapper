{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gobbler", "overview": "Gobbler is a Pac-Man clone that is mostly identical to the original arcade game. The maze layout is slightly different but otherwise it offers the same gameplay. The gobbler has to clear the maze of all dots while avoiding the ghosts that chase him. Picking up a large dot energizes the gobbler for ten seconds, allowing him to go after the ghosts. Dots are worth five points, ghosts are worth 200-800 points and fruit is worth 200 points. The gobbler has three lives. The game can be played with either keyboard or joystick.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "August 15, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "On-Line Systems", "publishers": "On-Line Systems", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobbler_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84965-gobbler\n"}
