{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bellhop", "overview": "Bellhop is a 1-player arcade game for the Apple II. The player plays as a bellhop, who tries to deliver the maximum number pieces of luggage before their tip runs out. The player can move left and right. Bags appear in the bottom right of the screen, and the player must ride an elevator to the upper floors to deliver bags, one bag per room, and return to the bottom right for another bag. The player can fall through spaces when no elevator is present, but this does not injure them. When the tip reaches 0, the player gets their final payment.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "May 8, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imaginative Systems Software", "publishers": "Hayden Book Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHsTEkudFdk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115356-bellhop\n"}
