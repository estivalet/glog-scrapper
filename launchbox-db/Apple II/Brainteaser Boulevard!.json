{"altername_name": ["Brainteaser Boulevard"], "name": "Brainteaser Boulevard!", "overview": "In Brainteaser Boulevard! the player takes control of a scout whose task it is to help old ladies cross a busy street full of cars and trucks. The game is similar to Frogger (albeit without the river section), with the player starting out at the bottom of the screen and having to move from lane to lane while avoiding the vehicles that pass by. Once he has reached the top of the screen he has to go all the way back but this time accompanied by an old lady. A level is completed when there are no more ladies to save. There are two difficulties: advanced and beginner. In the former there are three ladies and fast cars while in the latter there are five ladies but the cars are slower.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "California Pacific Computer", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371745-brainteaser-boulevard\n"}
