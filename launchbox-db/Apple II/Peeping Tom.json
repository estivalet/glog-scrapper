{"altername_name": [], "name": "Peeping Tom", "overview": "Peeping Tom is a 1-player arcade shooter for the Apple II. The player controls a small spaceship which moves left to right on the bottom of the screen, and can shoot vertically forwards. Each level starts with 4 windows, 3 of which are closed. Behind the window, enemy spaceships move about, and fire at the player. If the player shoots a spaceship behind a curtain, the curtain opens revealing the spaceships behind. When the player destroys all enemy spaceships, they move onto a level with faster moving more difficult vessels. If the player is struck by enemy fire, their ship is destroyed. The player has a total of 10 ships, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Lab", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113827-peeping-tom\n"}
