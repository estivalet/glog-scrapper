You might think you're using an ordinary computer -- but Microzine will turn it into a time machine, a newspaper maker, and a puzzle factory. Here's how.... First, travel back to the days of America's fronteir in the Twista-plot, Wagons West. You'll make the decisions that will help your wagon train on the long, dangerous trip to California. Do you have a nose for news? Let the presses roll with Newspaper Maker! Use this program to write newspaper articles and lay out a newspaper that you can print. Then in T-shirt Puzzles, team up with your trusty robot, \"Model Tee,\" and tackle tricky pattern-puzzles. Use the T-shirt factory machines to match the patterns you see in each puzzle. Create puzzles of your own to stump your friends. In Back Page, laugh at Dudley, the robotic troublemaker, in Microtoon. You'll also read some letters from other Microzine readers", "platform": "Apple II", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115106-microzine-12\n"}
