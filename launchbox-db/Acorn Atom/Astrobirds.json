{"name": "Astrobirds", "overview": "Astrobirds is a take on the classic Galaxian arcade game. <br><br>The total invasion fleet of 19 Astrobirds shift back and forth across the screen dropping bombs. The Astrobirds carry out swooping attacks, one by one, on your laser base, which can be hit three times before the game is over.  When you have successfully cleared the screen the next fleet appears. As the game goes on the Astrobirds move faster and drop more bombs until you can't cope.", "platform": "Acorn Atom", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Program Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153742"}
