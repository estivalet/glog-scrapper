{"name":"The Legend of Kage","description":"You play Kage, a skillful ninja in search of rescuing Princess Kiri from the hands of the warlord Yoshi.  Armed only with a sword and \u0027star knives\u0027, you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task.  Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle.  These levels repeat as the seasons change.  The gameplay is side scrolling.  Kage\u0027s moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken.  The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit.  2-players are supported, but must take turns.","publishedBy":"Taito Corporation","developedBy":"Taito Corporation","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Commodore 64, NES, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 4, Sharp X1, Wii, Wii U, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/legend-of-kage","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Taito Corporation","developer":"Taito Corporation","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131958-the-legend-of-kage-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131959-the-legend-of-kage-msx-screenshot-intro.png","/images/shots/l/131960-the-legend-of-kage-msx-screenshot-watch-out.png","/images/shots/l/131961-the-legend-of-kage-msx-screenshot-search-the-trees.png"],"cover":[]}
