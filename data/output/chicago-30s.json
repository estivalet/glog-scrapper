{"name":"Chicago 30\u0027s","description":"You are Eliot, on the trail of the gangsters who dominate Chicago in the 1930s. They lurk in the docks, on the streets and in an alcohol distillery, armed with guns and grenades, and must be taken out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGameplay is side-view and takes place on a number of vertical levels, with a feel similar to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/rushn-attack\"\u003eGreen Beret\u003c/a\u003e. Jump and duck to target and avoid crooks. Later you spend time inside a car, and can lean out of the window to shoot people. Watch out for enemy cars, which can only be destroyed using grenades.","publishedBy":"Topo Soft","developedBy":"Topo Soft","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/chicago-30s","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Topo Soft","developer":"Topo Soft","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/440901-chicago-30-s-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/440902-chicago-30-s-msx-screenshot-credits.png","/images/shots/l/440903-chicago-30-s-msx-screenshot-starting-location.png","/images/shots/l/440904-chicago-30-s-msx-screenshot-i-was-shot-and-lost-a-life.png"],"cover":[]}
