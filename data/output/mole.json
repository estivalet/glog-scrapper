{"name":"Mole","description":"\u003ci\u003eMole\u003c/i\u003e is a whack-a-mole type of game where the objective is to hit on the head of colored moles as they emerge from 8 holes situated in cardinal and ordinal directions from the center of the field. However, the color of the mallet changes frequently and the player has to respond to it because hitting a mole of the same color as the mallet will result in decrease of the score bar. If the player is unable to fill the score in time (indicated by a timer bar), the game is lost. There are 9 difficulty levels, with higher difficulty featuring more frequent appearance of moles of the same color as the mallet, thus requiring more attention of the player.","publishedBy":"ASCII Corporation","developedBy":"","released":"1983","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/mole","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"ASCII Corporation","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1983","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/588630-mole-msx-screenshot-the-dreadful-moles.png","/images/shots/l/588625-mole-msx-screenshot-a-fancy-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/588626-mole-msx-screenshot-instructions-and-credits.png","/images/shots/l/588627-mole-msx-screenshot-time-to-whack.png","/images/shots/l/588628-mole-msx-screenshot-got-ya.png","/images/shots/l/588629-mole-msx-screenshot-almost.png","/images/shots/l/588624-mole-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
