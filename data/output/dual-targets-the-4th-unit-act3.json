The game retains the simple sporadic turn-based battles of the predecessors. However, the core adventure gameplay has been radically simplified and modified to resemble a visual novel. There is no direct interaction with the environment; instead, the player is prompted to select emotional responses (\u0026quot;happy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;angry\u0026quot;, etc.) during dialogue, as well as alternate between \u0026quot;Rescue\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Think\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;Fight\u0026quot; commands during the storyline.
