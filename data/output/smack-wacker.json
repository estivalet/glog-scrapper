{"name":"Smack Wacker","description":"Smack Wacker puts you into the role of a pair of false teeth, stuck in a maze filled with fluour pills, and nasty mouth bacteria. So this is a \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dPac-Man\"\u003ePac-Man\u003c/a\u003e-like maze gobbler.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike the intricate mazes and smart ghosts of Pac-Man, Smack Wacker is very mechanical. The maze is made up of smaller and smaller squares inside each other, thereby forming corridors. The openings between the corridors move around the edges of the boxes, and the mouth bacteria move singlemindedly around and around in their respective corridors. You tell the false teeth to move clockwise or counter-clockwise in a corridor, or to stop and wait for the opening to the adjacent corridor to pass by. Colliding with the mouth bacteria, which mirror your own movement, doesn\u0027t instantly kill you, since you have a power bar.","publishedBy":"Eaglesoft","developedBy":"The Bytebusters","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/smack-wacker","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Eaglesoft","developer":"The Bytebusters","ported":"","country":" The Netherlands","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/245022-smack-wacker-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/245024-smack-wacker-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/245025-smack-wacker-msx-screenshot-waiting-in-the-middle-of-the-screen.png","/images/shots/l/245028-smack-wacker-msx-screenshot-eating-and-eating.png","/images/shots/l/245030-smack-wacker-msx-screenshot-eating-and-eating-and-eating.png","/images/shots/l/245026-smack-wacker-msx-screenshot-running-into-a-bacteria.png","/images/shots/l/245027-smack-wacker-msx-screenshot-killed-by-the-bacteria.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/91906-smack-wacker-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/91908-smack-wacker-msx-inside-cover.png","/images/covers/l/91907-smack-wacker-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/91909-smack-wacker-msx-media.jpg"]}
