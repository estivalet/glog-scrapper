It is Adol\u0027s task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eYs: The Vanished Omens\u003c/i\u003e is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the \u0026quot;attack\u0026quot; button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero\u0027s death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.","publishedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Apple IIgs, DOS, FM-7, NES, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1, SEGA Master System | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Bird\u0027s-eye view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/ys-the-vanished-omens","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120219-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-title-screen.gif","/images/shots/l/120213-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-starting-location.gif","/images/shots/l/120214-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-character-information.gif","/images/shots/l/120215-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-weapon-shop.gif","/images/shots/l/120216-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-armor-shop.gif","/images/shots/l/120217-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-inventory-screen.gif","/images/shots/l/120218-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-fortune-teller.gif","/images/shots/l/120212-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-drugstore.gif","/images/shots/l/120220-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-outside-the-town.gif","/images/shots/l/120221-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-some-pesky-monsters-attack.gif","/images/shots/l/120222-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-dialogue-in-the-town.gif","/images/shots/l/120223-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-in-the-bar.gif","/images/shots/l/120224-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-screenshot-be-careful-dogs.gif"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/80134-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/80135-ys-the-vanished-omens-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
