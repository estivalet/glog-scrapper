{"name":"PuzzlePanic","description":"Puzzle Panic consists of a series of small pattern-based puzzles, through which you guide Benny (a light-bulb) to the correct answers. Each level can be played individually, or in sequence as part of a larger puzzle, where each level is signified by a unique symbol, that users must discover to complete the final puzzle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome puzzles are timed challenges, such as \u0026quot;Color Climb\u0026quot;, where Benny must climb a series of coloured steps, with clues to the correct colour provided at the top of the screen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOthers are pattern based, such as \u0026quot;Triangles First\u0026quot;, where Benny must touch all triangles on the screen, followed by squares, then pentagons, etc. In these levels, Benny must also avoid being captured by a Devil-shaped enemy who is chasing him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery level requires the player to recognise some form of shape, colour, number and/or spatial pattern.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompleting each level reveals a series of gates containing different symbols, and passage through these gates will help Benny discover the relationship between the symbols and the levels. In the final level, the \u0026quot;metasequence\u0026quot;, Benny must correctly identify the symbol representing each level, and select them in the order that they were played.","publishedBy":"SystemSoft","developedBy":"Fun and Games","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, PC-88, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Side view, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/puzzlepanic","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"SystemSoft","developer":"Fun and Games","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
