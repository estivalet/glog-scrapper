{"name":"Backgammon","description":"A computer version of the classic board game Backgammon. The game board is displayed from a top down perspective. The game lets the player compete against a computer opponent. The objective of the game is to be the first player to move all fifteen of their pieces off of the board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe typical rules of Backgammon apply. Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponents pieces. Doing that will send their opponents piece back to their own home base.","publishedBy":"Philips Export B.V.","developedBy":"Electric Software Limited","released":"1984","alsoFor":"","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/backgammon_esl","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Philips Export B.V.","developer":"Electric Software Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/838845-backgammon-msx-screenshot-developer-logo.png","/images/shots/l/838846-backgammon-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/838847-backgammon-msx-screenshot-gameplay.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/328773-backgammon-msx-front-cover.png","/images/covers/l/328772-backgammon-msx-inside-cover.png"]}
