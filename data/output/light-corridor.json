{"name":"The Light Corridor","description":"The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must \u0027serve\u0027 the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.","publishedBy":"Infogrames Europe SA","developedBy":"Infogrames Europe SA","released":"1990","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Puzzle","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/light-corridor","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Infogrames Europe SA","developer":"Infogrames Europe SA","ported":"New Frontier","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/141971-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/141972-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/141973-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-play-select-and-options.png","/images/shots/l/141974-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-level-one.png","/images/shots/l/141975-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-move-to-a-start-position.png","/images/shots/l/141989-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-there-goes-the-ball.png","/images/shots/l/141990-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-catch-that-bouncing-ball.png","/images/shots/l/141991-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-high-score-screen.png","/images/shots/l/141992-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-options-screen.png","/images/shots/l/141993-the-light-corridor-msx-screenshot-player-and-music-select.png"],"cover":[]}
