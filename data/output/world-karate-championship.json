{"name":"World Karate Championship","description":"The objective of \u003ci\u003eWorld Karate Championship\u003c/i\u003e  is to get the highest possible dan (karate grade, determined by belt colour) and become the world champion - and of course, to get the highest score. Karate fighters compete against each other on side-view screens, the scenery representing real world locations (New York, Egypt, Japan, etc.). In between the fighting stages, there are short action sequences, during which the player can gather bonus points. These include deflecting bouncing balls, breaking wooden planks, and others.","publishedBy":"Endurance Games Ltd.","developedBy":"System 3 Software Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, DOS, PC Booter, Wii, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Sports","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/world-karate-championship","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Endurance Games Ltd.","developer":"System 3 Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":" France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 014293 007504","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131355-world-karate-championship-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131356-world-karate-championship-msx-screenshot-new-york.png","/images/shots/l/131357-world-karate-championship-msx-screenshot-full-point.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/82244-world-karate-championship-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/82245-world-karate-championship-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/82246-world-karate-championship-msx-media.jpg"]}
