The player leads a party of four characters (with the option to either define your own characters or take a  predefined group) through the land to eventually challenge, confront and defeat Yarod-Nor in his own castle. Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to trade, and develop your characters skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe four predefined characters are:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSyrela: a human female minstrel,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodus: a male dwarf thief,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGelth: a male elf wizard, and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTorlin: a male mi-orc ranger\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eEach character has values for the following attributes, constitution, strength, knowledge, wisdom, dexterity, and appearance.
