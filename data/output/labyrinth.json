{"name":"Labyrinth","description":"The player starts this game off controlling the actions of an ordinary citizen on their way to a movie theater. In the south cinema, the player chats with two teenagers about the actual movie at which point a hush descends upon the room and the in-game film begins...where the player learns that they have been chosen to be the thrall of Jareth the Goblin King, who must be overcome to finish the game. A clock ticks down 13 meager hours to complete this task, lest the player\u0027s character end up lost in the labyrinth forever.","publishedBy":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","developedBy":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Apple II, Commodore 64, PC-88 | Combined View","genre":"Action, Adventure","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/labyrinth","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","developer":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","ported":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/139811-labyrinth-msx-screenshot-credit-screen.png","/images/shots/l/139839-labyrinth-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/139840-labyrinth-msx-screenshot-jareth-played-by-david-bowie-in-the.png","/images/shots/l/139841-labyrinth-msx-screenshot-the-beginning-of-the-game.png","/images/shots/l/139842-labyrinth-msx-screenshot-a-piece-of-lumber.png","/images/shots/l/139843-labyrinth-msx-screenshot-talk-to-hoggle.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/382870-labyrinth-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/382871-labyrinth-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/382872-labyrinth-msx-spine-sides.jpg"]}
