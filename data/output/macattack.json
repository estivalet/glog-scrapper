{"name":"MacAttack","description":"This game is a ripoff of the classic arcade game \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/burgertime\"\u003eBurgertime\u003c/a\u003e. You are a hamburger chef and you\u0027re out to build delicious hamburgers. As you run through the colorful maze assembling the ingredients, there is nothing that can stop you. Except maybe the menacing egg, hot dog and pickles that are out to ruin the meal! You can bury them under beef patties, lettuce and buns. Or, knock them out with pepper. To complete a level you have to build four burgers.","publishedBy":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developedBy":"Aackosoft International B.V.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/macattack","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developer":"Aackosoft International B.V.","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131535-macattack-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131536-macattack-msx-screenshot-title-screen-2.png","/images/shots/l/131537-macattack-msx-screenshot-walk-through-the-maze-and-make-some.png","/images/shots/l/131538-macattack-msx-screenshot-chased-by-a-hot-dog-and-an-egg.png","/images/shots/l/131539-macattack-msx-screenshot-catch-the-bottle-before-it-disappears.png","/images/shots/l/139184-macattack-msx-screenshot-alternate-title-screen.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/183689-macattack-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/183688-macattack-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/183690-macattack-msx-media.jpg"]}
