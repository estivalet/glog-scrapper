{"name":"Pink Sox 3","description":"\u003ci\u003ePink Sox 3\u003c/i\u003e is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi Japanese-style adventure \u003ci\u003eWho Is There?\u003c/i\u003e, focusing primarily on lesbian relationships of the characters. The quiz game returns in a simplified form, with the tile-matching puzzle portions completely removed; the player simply has to answer several global knowledge questions correctly to unravel an erotic picture. New to this volume is a card game played with a special deck, in which players try to assemble pairs and other combinations in order to beat the partner.","publishedBy":"Wendy Magazine","developedBy":"Wendy Magazine","released":"Jul 17, 1990","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Compilation","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pink-sox-3","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Wendy Magazine","developer":"Wendy Magazine","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Jul 17, 1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
