{"name":"Snake It","description":"You maneuver a snake across the screen eating clovers that make it grow. At the the same time you have to avoid obstacles like it\u0027s own tail, poisoned mushrooms and the screen edge. For each object you eat a round object will appear, which you also have to eat but it won\u0027t make your tail grow. Hearts may move around the screen and can be eaten for bonuses. You \u0027ll enter the next round when all objects are cleared.","publishedBy":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developedBy":"Eaglesoft","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/snake-it","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developer":"Eaglesoft","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","developer":"Eaglesoft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Al Alamiah","developer":"Eaglesoft","ported":"","country":" Other","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/133112-snake-it-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/445085-snake-it-msx-screenshot-title-screen-aackosoft-release-the.png","/images/shots/l/133113-snake-it-msx-screenshot-eat-the-hearts-for-bonuses.png","/images/shots/l/133114-snake-it-msx-screenshot-a-new-round.png","/images/shots/l/133115-snake-it-msx-screenshot-don-t-eat-the-poisoned-mushroom-that.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118626-snake-it-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118625-snake-it-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120716-snake-it-msx-media.jpg"]}
