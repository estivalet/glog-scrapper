{"name":"Daedalian Opus","description":"In this game you play as Daedaleanopus.  Your mission is to solve puzzles.  These puzzles consist of placing shaped pieces into a space and completely filling the area with all the pieces- sort of like Tetris except you try to fill up all the space on the board.  Each puzzle is timed and after every puzzle you get a password so you can continue your game later.","publishedBy":"Karoshi Corporation","developedBy":"Vic Tokai Corporation","released":"Dec 31, 2006","alsoFor":"Game Boy | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/daedalian-opus","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Karoshi Corporation","developer":"Vic Tokai Corporation","ported":"Karoshi Corporation","country":" Worldwide","releaseDate":"Dec 31, 2006","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/204746-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-another-karoshi-port.png","/images/shots/l/204747-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/204748-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-instructions.png","/images/shots/l/204749-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-dr-p-introduces-you-to-the-world.png","/images/shots/l/204750-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-entering-room-1.png","/images/shots/l/204751-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-a-simple-one.png","/images/shots/l/204752-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-after-completion-you-receive.png","/images/shots/l/204753-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-pick-up-mirror-and-rotate-the.png","/images/shots/l/204754-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-another-one-solved.png","/images/shots/l/204756-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-sometimes-not-all-blocks-fit.png","/images/shots/l/204757-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-a-diificult-one.png","/images/shots/l/204758-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-between-rooms-you-receive-new.png","/images/shots/l/204759-daedalian-opus-msx-screenshot-i-give-up.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/77968-daedalian-opus-msx-front-cover.png"]}
