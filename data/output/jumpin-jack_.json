As usual, your goal is to safely guide the frog across the road, avoiding the cars, jumping on the turtles and tree trunks across the river and land safely in one of the five slots on the other shore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe C64 and MSX versions add a pseudo-isometric effect to the graphics, as well as a female frog and an insect to be eaten for bonus points. After all five slots are filled up, the gameplay repeats, but faster.","publishedBy":"LiveWire Software UK","developedBy":"","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Commodore 64, VIC-20 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/jumpin-jack_","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"LiveWire Software UK","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/656281-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/656282-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/656283-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-jumping.png","/images/shots/l/656284-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-taking-a-ride-on-a-turtle.png","/images/shots/l/656285-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-the-frog-dies-if-it-goes-off-screen.png","/images/shots/l/656286-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-run-over-by-a-car.png","/images/shots/l/656287-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-the-frog-has-eaten-a-white-thing.png","/images/shots/l/656288-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-aiming-for-the-insect.png","/images/shots/l/656289-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-one-happy-frog.png","/images/shots/l/656290-jumpin-jack-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
