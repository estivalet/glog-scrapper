Players control a World War I plane and need to take out other planes in the air in different waves. After the first level the game moves to other wars and presents more difficult enemies to shoot at. In each level the player has to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible to continue to the next level. New levels offer better weapons but more enemies need to be taken out. After a few levels an animated sequence is shown before moving on to a new war.","publishedBy":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developedBy":"","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/time-curb","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" France, Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Eurosoft","developer":"","ported":"","country":" France, Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":"Re-release"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/445536-time-curb-msx-screenshot-title-screen-as-time-rider.png","/images/shots/l/445537-time-curb-msx-screenshot-beginning-in-world-war-i.png","/images/shots/l/445538-time-curb-msx-screenshot-shooting-at-the-enemy.png","/images/shots/l/445539-time-curb-msx-screenshot-they-got-me.png","/images/shots/l/445540-time-curb-msx-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-lives-game-over-i-can.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/119826-time-curb-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/119825-time-curb-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169685-time-curb-msx-media.jpg"]}
