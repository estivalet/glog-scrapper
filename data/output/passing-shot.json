The player travels from France, to Australia, to the US and end up in England and get to listen to the national anthem of each country. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are four difficulty levels to select the skill of the computer controlled player. One or two players may play but always against the computer. In a two player game, both players play as a doubles team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game starts off looking behind the player as the style of serve is chosen (top spin, curve, etc) and then it switches to a top down view for the rally.","publishedBy":"Image Works","developedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Sports","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Tennis","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/passing-shot","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Image Works","developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","ported":"Teque Software Development Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"5 012342 999619","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/213870-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/213871-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-main-setup.png","/images/shots/l/213872-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-choose-a-level.png","/images/shots/l/213873-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-ready-for-a-match.png","/images/shots/l/213874-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-serving.png","/images/shots/l/213875-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-double-fault.png","/images/shots/l/213876-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-after-the-serve-the-game-changes.png","/images/shots/l/213877-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-he-got-me.png","/images/shots/l/213878-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-that-s-a-high-ball.png","/images/shots/l/213879-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-the-yellow-faceball-taunts-you.png","/images/shots/l/213880-passing-shot-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/126082-passing-shot-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/126081-passing-shot-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/126080-passing-shot-msx-media.jpg"]}
