{"name":"Sport Racer","description":"\u003cem\u003eSport Racer\u003c/em\u003e owes much to Konami\u0027s MSX classic \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/road-fighter\"\u003eRoad Fighter\u003c/a\u003e, but does away with all the fancy curves and artificial intelligence on behalf of the other drivers in order to fit within 8 kilobytes, which places it within the same category as some of the very earliest racing games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe player\u0027s task is simply to drive his car on a straight road filled with heavy traffic. Use the space key to accelerate; the car will decelerate once released. In order to keep up with the traffic, players will often find themselves \u0026quot;pumping\u0026quot; the accelerator to keep the speed at a balanced level during takeovers and other sticky situations. Otherwise they risk running into either the car in front or the one behind. Players have five \u0026quot;lives\u0026quot;, and losing a life also means losing speed and precious seconds. A red gauge on the side of the screen displays the player\u0027s position on the track; a green one counts down the seconds in which they have to complete the race. The game has two levels with five races each. Each race has a different locale and time of day.","publishedBy":"","developedBy":"","released":"Aug 27, 2006","alsoFor":"","genre":"Racing / Driving","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/sport-racer","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/184661-sport-racer-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/184662-sport-racer-msx-screenshot-the-first-race-starts.png","/images/shots/l/184666-sport-racer-msx-screenshot-if-i-just-hurry-up-i-might-make.png","/images/shots/l/184664-sport-racer-msx-screenshot-the-race-is-over.png","/images/shots/l/184665-sport-racer-msx-screenshot-second-race.png","/images/shots/l/184668-sport-racer-msx-screenshot-argh.png"],"cover":[]}
