{"name":"Konami\u0027s Boxing","description":"A boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.Each punch weakens your opponent\u0027s strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option.","publishedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"1985","alsoFor":"","genre":"Sports","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED], Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Boxing","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/konamis-boxing","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Konami Industry Co.
