{"name":"Saurusland","description":"\u003ci\u003eSaurusland\u003c/i\u003e is an early simulator of life in the paleolithic age, putting you as a blocky-pixeled caveman in a (non-scrolling) landscape filled with volatile volcanos, moles, mammoths and tyrannosaurs. Dodge the animals, or use your club to kill them for points. After a minute of play, the volcanos erupt, and you must dodge the falling lava.","publishedBy":"Colpax","developedBy":"","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Tomy Tutor | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/saurusland","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Colpax","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/718674-saurusland-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/718676-saurusland-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/718677-saurusland-msx-screenshot-attacked-from-two-directions-at.png","/images/shots/l/718678-saurusland-msx-screenshot-a-mole-pops-its-head-up.png","/images/shots/l/718679-saurusland-msx-screenshot-the-volcano-erupts.png","/images/shots/l/718680-saurusland-msx-screenshot-watch-out-for-falling-lava-rocks.png","/images/shots/l/718682-saurusland-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
