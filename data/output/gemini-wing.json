{"name":"Gemini Wing","description":"Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred towards aliens. They respond by invading the planet, and it\u0027s down to the protagonist to clear up a situation scarily similar to reality in this arcade conversion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eGemini Wing\u003c/i\u003e is a vertically-scrolling shoot \u0027em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.","publishedBy":"Virgin Mastertronic Ltd.","developedBy":"Tecmo, Ltd.","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sharp X68000, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/gemini-wing","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Virgin Mastertronic Ltd.","developer":"Tecmo, Ltd.","ported":"Imagitec Design Ltd.","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/430301-gemini-wing-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/430302-gemini-wing-msx-screenshot-high-scores.png","/images/shots/l/430303-gemini-wing-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/430304-gemini-wing-msx-screenshot-firing-on-the-enemy.png","/images/shots/l/430305-gemini-wing-msx-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-lives-game-over.png","/images/shots/l/430306-gemini-wing-msx-screenshot-i-can-input-my-name-for-a-new-high.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/168663-gemini-wing-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/168662-gemini-wing-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/168664-gemini-wing-msx-media.jpg"]}
