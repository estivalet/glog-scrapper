{"name":"Rambo III","description":"Rambo\u0027s mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won\u0027t mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you\u0027ve gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSection two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/operation-wolf\"\u003eOperation Wolf\u003c/a\u003e-style shoot \u0027em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.","publishedBy":"Ocean Software Ltd.","developedBy":"Ocean Software Ltd.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/rambo-iii","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","developer":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Italy, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"5 013156 012815","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/150591-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/150592-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-options-and-credits.png","/images/shots/l/150593-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-the-first-part-of-your-mission.png","/images/shots/l/150594-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-starting-out-in-the-fort.png","/images/shots/l/150595-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-the-soldiers-just-walk-back-and-forth.png","/images/shots/l/150596-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-a-crowded-room.png","/images/shots/l/150597-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-rambo-s-head-turns-into-a-cranium.png","/images/shots/l/150598-rambo-iii-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118577-rambo-iii-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118579-rambo-iii-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118576-rambo-iii-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
