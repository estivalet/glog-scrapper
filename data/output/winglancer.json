{"name":"Winglancer","description":"\u003cem\u003eWinglancer\u003c/em\u003e is an attempt to create a so-called \u0026quot;mania shooting game\u0026quot; for the MSX2 (and subsequently Windows). Mania shooters have been popularised by \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?company\u003dCAVE+Co%2e%2c+Ltd%2e\"\u003eCave\u003c/a\u003e and can be characterized as vertically scrolling shooters with an emphasis on putting as many bullets on screen as possible. In order to make a game where the screen is often covered with bullets playable, your \u0026quot;hit box\u0026quot; is not your entire ship, as in the shoot\u0027em\u0027ups of the eighties and early nineties. Instead, only a small box one or a few pixels in size is your sensitive area, and bullets may otherwise pass right through you, as long as they don\u0027t pass your sweet spot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite its modern play mechanics, \u003cem\u003eWinglancer\u003c/em\u003e has a consciously retro look, similar to the classics such as \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/galaga\"\u003eGalaga\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dGalaxian\"\u003eGalaxian\u003c/a\u003e, including a score panel occupying a large part of the screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWinglancer\u003c/em\u003e has five stages, three ships with various weaponry and speed, four difficulty levels ranging from \u0026quot;easy\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;god\u0026quot; and two rounds in which to clear the game. It also has a boss mode, where you only train yourself against the game\u0027s bosses, one after one. Apart from your ship\u0027s main weapon (choose from power, wave or laser), you have three smart bombs per life. From time to time, you will find bonus bombs coming down the screen. When enemies are shot, they will sometimes release a star. When picked up, the star will render you invincible for less than a second â?? enough time to move through a particularly tricky bullet pattern.","publishedBy":"","developedBy":"","released":"Aug 30, 2002","alsoFor":"Windows | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/winglancer","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/185339-winglancer-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/185340-winglancer-msx-screenshot-select-fighter.png","/images/shots/l/185341-winglancer-msx-screenshot-the-wave-weapon-can-be-directed.png","/images/shots/l/185344-winglancer-msx-screenshot-approaching-a-boss.png","/images/shots/l/185345-winglancer-msx-screenshot-shoot-the-drones-to-get-a-star.png","/images/shots/l/185346-winglancer-msx-screenshot-killed-the-boss.png","/images/shots/l/185347-winglancer-msx-screenshot-results-for-this-round.png","/images/shots/l/185348-winglancer-msx-screenshot-a-middle-boss-with-double-weapons.png","/images/shots/l/185350-winglancer-msx-screenshot-take-the-star-for-momentary-invincibility.png","/images/shots/l/185351-winglancer-msx-screenshot-boss-1-2.png","/images/shots/l/185353-winglancer-msx-screenshot-very-pretty-bullet-pattern.png","/images/shots/l/185354-winglancer-msx-screenshot-the-red-ship-has-a-powerful-weapon.png","/images/shots/l/185355-winglancer-msx-screenshot-playing-boss-mode.png","/images/shots/l/185356-winglancer-msx-screenshot-a-bonus-bomb-comes-for-you-to-catch.png","/images/shots/l/185357-winglancer-msx-screenshot-the-blue-ship-has-a-weak-laser-but.png","/images/shots/l/185349-winglancer-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
