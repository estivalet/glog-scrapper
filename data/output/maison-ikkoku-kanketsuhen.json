It centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot line. The game\u0027s story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the conclusion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is a \u0026quot;puzzle-less\u0026quot; adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual \u0026quot;Look\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Talk\u0026quot;, and Move\u0026quot; typical for Japanese adventures (no \u0026quot;Think\u0026quot; command), but also context-sensitive commands \u0026quot;Eat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Drink\u0026quot;, etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.","publishedBy":"Micro Cabin Corp.","developedBy":"Micro Cabin Corp.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/maison-ikkoku-kanketsuhen","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/433916-maison-ikkoku-kanketsuhen-msx-screenshot-opening-intro.png","/images/shots/l/433917-maison-ikkoku-kanketsuhen-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/433918-maison-ikkoku-kanketsuhen-msx-screenshot-opening-story-and.png","/images/shots/l/433919-maison-ikkoku-kanketsuhen-msx-screenshot-we-are-in-a-room.png"],"cover":[]}
