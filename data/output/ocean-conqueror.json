{"name":"Ocean Conqueror","description":"As a submarine pilot within a war, your task is to destroy enemy munitions convoys in your sector. There are eight destroyers and four transports to destroy, within a time limit of 18 hours. You are armed with torpedos and guided missiles (upon firing one, control inputs are applied to the missile, rather than the ship). You also have a long range radar and a static map with co-ordinates. Controls are complex, with the periscope and rudder coming under your direct control.","publishedBy":"Hewson Consultants Ltd.","developedBy":"","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Simulation","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/ocean-conqueror","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Hewson Consultants Ltd.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012635 090016","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/445004-ocean-conqueror-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/445005-ocean-conqueror-msx-screenshot-starting-out-at-the-dock.png","/images/shots/l/445006-ocean-conqueror-msx-screenshot-firing-a-torpedo.png","/images/shots/l/445007-ocean-conqueror-msx-screenshot-boom-i-hit.png","/images/shots/l/445008-ocean-conqueror-msx-screenshot-the-map.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/169928-ocean-conqueror-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169927-ocean-conqueror-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169929-ocean-conqueror-msx-media.jpg"]}
