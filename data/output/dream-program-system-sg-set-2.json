At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are \u0026quot;neutral\u0026quot;, having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered \u0026quot;bad\u0026quot; by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.","publishedBy":"Alice Soft","developedBy":"Alice Soft","released":"May 15, 1991","alsoFor":"FM Towns, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dream-program-system-sg-set-2","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Alice Soft","developer":"Alice Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"May 15, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
