{"name":"Uchi Mata","description":"\u003cem\u003eUchi Mata\u003c/em\u003e is a unique tournament-based Judo fighting game in which you play as a judoka in the ultimate tournament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is played from a non-scrolling side view. You control your fighter and attempt to get within striking distance of your opponent, however you don\u0027t attack directly with your attack button. Instead, your attack command puts you in a fighting stance that allows you to input a series of directional moves. That, combined with the correct feet placement of both fighters (which can be seen in a helpful window) allows you to unleash specific throws and offensive maneuvers that form the basis of the combat in the game. A stamina and health bar also keep your attacks in check, as you may need to rest and build up your strength in order to perform effective attacks.","publishedBy":"Martech Games Ltd.","developedBy":"Martech Games Ltd.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/uchi-mata","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Martech Games Ltd.","developer":"Martech Games Ltd.","ported":"Beechnut Creative Software Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012753 000805","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/445050-uchi-mata-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/445051-uchi-mata-msx-screenshot-setting-up-for-a-throw.png","/images/shots/l/445052-uchi-mata-msx-screenshot-hi-ya.png","/images/shots/l/445053-uchi-mata-msx-screenshot-and-he-is-down.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118697-uchi-mata-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118698-uchi-mata-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118696-uchi-mata-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120736-uchi-mata-msx-media.jpg"]}
