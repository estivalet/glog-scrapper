Fray can only use her staff, which works as a ranged weapon, casting projectiles. By pressing down the action button, it is possible to increase the size and the power of the projected missile.

Fray visits towns on the way, where she can buy weapons, armor, potions, and magical spells.","publishedBy":"Micro Cabin Corp.","developedBy":"Micro Cabin Corp.","released":"1990","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/fray-in-magical-adventure","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"","comments":"MSX TurboR version"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/838369-fray-in-magical-adventure-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/838370-fray-in-magical-adventure-msx-screenshot-starting-the-game.png","/images/shots/l/838371-fray-in-magical-adventure-msx-screenshot-walking-around.png","/images/shots/l/838372-fray-in-magical-adventure-msx-screenshot-inside-a-church.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/307004-fray-in-magical-adventure-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/307005-fray-in-magical-adventure-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/307006-fray-in-magical-adventure-msx-other.jpg"]}
