{"name":"Toobin\u0027","description":"Toobin\u0027 involves Biff and Jet racing their way down the rapids of a river, riding on tires. You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there\u0027s a kickin\u0027 party at the end if you succeed.","publishedBy":"Domark Ltd.","developedBy":"Atari Games Corporation","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, Game Boy Color, NES, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/toobin","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Domark Ltd.","developer":"Atari Games Corporation","ported":"Teque Software Development Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/181965-toobin-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/181967-toobin-msx-screenshot-setup-screen.png","/images/shots/l/181968-toobin-msx-screenshot-waiting-for-players-to-join.png","/images/shots/l/181969-toobin-msx-screenshot-bif-is-ready.png","/images/shots/l/181970-toobin-msx-screenshot-pick-up-some-treasure.png","/images/shots/l/181971-toobin-msx-screenshot-gaining-speed-in-the-waterfall.png","/images/shots/l/181972-toobin-msx-screenshot-hunted-by-a-crocodile.png","/images/shots/l/181973-toobin-msx-screenshot-try-to-pass-through-the-gates-for-bonus.png","/images/shots/l/181974-toobin-msx-screenshot-getting-more-dangerous.png","/images/shots/l/181975-toobin-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
