{"name":"Congo Bongo","description":"\u003ci\u003eCongo Bongo\u003c/i\u003e is an arcade platform game similar in many ways to \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dDonkey+Kong\"\u003eDonkey Kong\u003c/a\u003e, but with an isometric perspective. The player takes control of a safari hunter who is searching for an ape named Bongo, determined to punish him for setting the hunter\u0027s tent on fire. The game consists of four one-screen stages, each with an objective to jump on platforms and reach the top. Various animals will try to stop the protagonist: for example, in the first level a large gorilla throws coconuts at him. The hero has no offensive abilities and must jump or otherwise avoid enemy attacks. Stages may contain obstacles or hazardous spots that would kill off the main character.","publishedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","developedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","released":"1983","alsoFor":"Apple II, Arcade, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, Intellivision, PC Booter, SG-1000, TI-99/4A, VIC-20 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Bird\u0027s-eye view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/congo-bongo","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1983","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/130880-congo-bongo-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/130881-congo-bongo-msx-screenshot-climb-the-stairs.png","/images/shots/l/130882-congo-bongo-msx-screenshot-high-scores-enter-your-name.png"],"cover":[]}
