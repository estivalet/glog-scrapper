{"name":"Beepertron","description":"Beepertron is a little musical game, reminiscent of the old electronic toy, Simon Says. The computer plays a short melody, up to 10 notes, on the on-screen piano, and then the player must play the same melody using the computer keyboard. After 7 false notes, the game is over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe subtitle \u0026quot;1 bit music game\u0026quot; is due to the fact that the standard MSX sound generator isn\u0027t used, instead all tones are generated with the small keyclick circuit.","publishedBy":"","developedBy":"","released":"Dec 20, 2006","alsoFor":"","genre":"Educational","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/beepertron","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/206231-beepertron-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/206232-beepertron-msx-screenshot-select-level-of-difficulty.png","/images/shots/l/206233-beepertron-msx-screenshot-the-computer-plays.png","/images/shots/l/206234-beepertron-msx-screenshot-you-play.png","/images/shots/l/206235-beepertron-msx-screenshot-wrong-note.png","/images/shots/l/206236-beepertron-msx-screenshot-too-many-errors-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/78570-beepertron-msx-front-cover.png"]}
