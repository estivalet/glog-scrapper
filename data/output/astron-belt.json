{"name":"Astron Belt","description":"\u003ci\u003eAstron Belt\u003c/i\u003e is an early laserdisc video game and third-person space combat rail shooter, released in 1983 by Sega in Japan and licensed to Bally Midway for release in the United States. Developed in 1982, it is commonly cited as the first laserdisc game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAstron Belt is basically an enhanced version of the simple space-shooters that were popular at the time. The player controls a lone spacecraft on a mission to singlehandedly take down the entire enemy armada. Enemy fighters and ships shoot at the player, and there are mines and other objects that must be shot or avoided.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is divided into waves. At the end of each wave is a command ship that must be destroyed. In later waves the enemy fighters move and shoot more aggressively, and their shots are more accurate. Some waves take place in open space, while others require the player to battle enemies while flying through narrow trenches and tunnels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe player is on a timer at the beginning of the game, with an unlimited number of lives available. The length of the timer can be adjusted by the machine operator, but is normally 60 seconds. After the timer expires, the player is given a limited number of additional lives. When all of those lives are lost, the game ends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAstron Belt came in both upright and cockpit cabinets. The cockpit version featured illuminated buttons on the control panel, a larger 25\u0026quot; monitor (the upright used a standard 19\u0026quot;), and a vibrating seat.","publishedBy":"Laser Disc Corporation","developedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","released":"Apr, 1984","alsoFor":"Arcade | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/astron-belt","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Laser Disc Corporation","developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Apr, 1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
