{"name":"Steve Davis Snooker","description":"Mike Lamb recreated the basic rules of the popular English game of snooker in this simulation, which can be played by one or two players, but has no computer opponent as such, unlike \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/steve-davis-world-snooker\"\u003ethe later 16-bit remake\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead, you are scored based not only on how many points you score legitimately, but also on how many points you concede through foul shots, and how many shots you take in total. You always take the next shot, even if you\u0027ve missed or fouled, so in a one player game the break-building strategies can be slightly more aggressive than in a real match, as there\u0027s no risk of leaving an opponent a chance\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs in the real game you start off by trying to pot a red (there are 10 or the real 15, depending on which mode you choose), and if successful choosing one of the 6 colours (by pressing the number corresponding to its points value). Once you\u0027ve lined up the direction of the shot, you will have to set the speed, and then the spin.
