{"name":"Randar no B?ken III: Yami ni Miserareta Majutsushi","description":"In this game, you don\u0027t play the cute little round creature Randar any more, but a human hero (whom you can name yourself), who lives with his parents in a medieval world. One day, his father send him to a nearby cave which is plagued by orcs, to defeat King Orc. Thus begins the journey of a young man who soon finds himself confronting the evil plans of the magician Nebiroth, who intends to resurrect the demon Varu and to draw from him the ultimate power he needs to control the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eRandar III\u003c/i\u003e is a Japanese-style RPG. You navigate your hero over world map and through dungeons from a top-down view, fighting enemies in turn-based combat. Combat and navigation in towns are done from first-person perspective. The enemies appear randomly on each screen, one after another, become visible and attack the hero if he doesn\u0027t move. If you leave the screen, the enemies will disappear, but re-spawn quickly when you return. It is possible to avoid combat by continuously walking, although in narrow areas you\u0027ll often find yourself trapped by enemies.","publishedBy":"Compile","developedBy":"Compile","released":"1990","alsoFor":"","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"1st-person, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/randar-no-bken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Compile","developer":"Compile","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120577-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120575-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120576-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120574-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120578-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120579-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120580-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120581-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120582-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120583-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120584-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120585-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120586-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120587-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120588-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120589-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120590-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120591-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120592-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120593-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120594-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120595-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif","/images/shots/l/120596-randar-no-boken-iii-yami-ni-miserareta-majutsushi-msx-screenshot.gif"],"cover":[]}
