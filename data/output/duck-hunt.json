{"name":"Duck Hunt","description":"\u003ci\u003eDuck Hunt\u003c/i\u003e is a shooting simulation where the player goes out with his faithful dogs to hunt ducks. It requires the use of the \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?attribute\u003dZapper\"\u003eZapper light gun\u003c/a\u003e. In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a first-person perspective. The dog scares the ducks out of the swamp, one at a time in mode A or two at a time in mode B. The ducks go flying around in the air and the player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are allowed. In game mode A, a second player can control the movement of the duck using a controller plugged into port 2.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.","publishedBy":"Karoshi Corporation","developedBy":"Nintendo R\u0026amp;D1","released":"Aug 11, 2004","alsoFor":"Arcade, NES, Wii U | Combined View","genre":"Action, Sports","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/duck-hunt","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Karoshi Corporation","developer":"Nintendo R\u0026amp;D1","ported":"Karoshi Corporation","country":" Worldwide","releaseDate":"Aug 11, 2004","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/185365-duck-hunt-msx-screenshot-another-karoshi-conversion.png","/images/shots/l/185366-duck-hunt-msx-screenshot-real-nintendo-style-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/185367-duck-hunt-msx-screenshot-your-dog-has-found-something.png","/images/shots/l/185368-duck-hunt-msx-screenshot-a-blue-duck.png","/images/shots/l/185369-duck-hunt-msx-screenshot-oh-i-missed-it.png","/images/shots/l/185370-duck-hunt-msx-screenshot-don-t-laugh-at-your-master.png","/images/shots/l/185371-duck-hunt-msx-screenshot-a-pretty-black-duck.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/69562-duck-hunt-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/69563-duck-hunt-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/69564-duck-hunt-msx-media.jpg"]}
