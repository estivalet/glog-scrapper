{"name":"Ogre","description":"\u003ci\u003eOgre\u003c/i\u003e is a 2D turn-based strategy game, and a direct computer conversion of Steve Jackson\u0027s board game of supertanks going against conventional infantry with howitzers. It plays exactly like the board game - on a hex-based board one player controls ordinary military units (soldiers, tanks etc.), and defends against the second player, who controls a supertank named \u0026quot;Ogre\u0026quot; - Ogre is very powerful, and can easily destroy normal weaponry and ground forces.","publishedBy":"SystemSoft","developedBy":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amiga, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, Macintosh, PC-88, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/ogre","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"SystemSoft","developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","ported":"SystemSoft","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/137520-ogre-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/137521-ogre-msx-screenshot-the-board-game.png","/images/shots/l/137522-ogre-msx-screenshot-place-tanks-howitzers-etc-on-the-board.png","/images/shots/l/137523-ogre-msx-screenshot-defend-your-ruler.png"],"cover":[]}
