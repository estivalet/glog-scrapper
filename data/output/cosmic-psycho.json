{"name":"Cosmic Psycho","description":"Kazuyuki is just an ordinary Japanese high-school student... or so he was before he saw a strange dream. In that dream, a girl was calling him from the outer space, imploring him to help her... The next day, Kazuyuki receives a strange phone call, after which he finds himself on board of a space ship! The girl from his dream appears and introduces herself: she is Marin, one of the members of a special squad that fights mysterious alien beings known as EX. Apparently, her message through time went to the wrong recipient, and now Kazuyuki is \u0026quot;stuck\u0026quot; in the end of the twenty-third century, reluctantly helping the beautiful ladies of the assault team to fight aliens - and perhaps engage in other, more pleasant activities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eCosmic Psycho\u003c/i\u003e plays predominantly like a typical Japanese adventure, with verb/object commands that must be chosen from a menu repeatedly to trigger the next scene. However, at certain points the game turns into a side-scrolling shooter. Clad in a flying robotic suit, Kazuyuki must blast his way through a (usually very short) stage filled with regular enemies and bosses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game contains scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.","publishedBy":"Cocktail Soft","developedBy":"Cocktail Soft","released":"Sep 14, 1991","alsoFor":"PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Action, Adventure","perspective":"1st-person, Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/cosmic-psycho","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Cocktail Soft","developer":"Cocktail Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Sep 14, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":["/images/covers/l/307052-cosmic-psycho-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/307053-cosmic-psycho-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
