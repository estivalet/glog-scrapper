{"name":"SuperStar Soccer","description":"Much of the design and programming of \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/superstar-ice-hockey\"\u003eSuperstar Ice Hockey\u003c/a\u003e (by many of the same programmers) is revised to provide a six-a-side soccer game. You can control any combination of centre-forward, goalkeeper (on the C64) and manager. For much of the game you are merely the centre-forward as the action unfolds around you - don\u0027t be afraid to track back and help out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ball sticks closely to a player, who can pass, shoot, head or bicycle-kick it. Goalkeepers are penalised for retaining possession for too long (a rule later adapted for use in real-life football). Match length can be between 6 and 90 minutes, by toggling the speed at which time moves. Fouls are fully implemented.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSingle matches can be played in the cassette version, but the disk version adds a full-season structure. 64 English teams are split into 4 divisions of 16, with a season consisting of either 7 or 15 matches.","publishedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Sports","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Football (European) / Soccer","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/superstar-soccer","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 013658 050032","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/454919-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/454920-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/454921-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-the-settings-for-a-league.png","/images/shots/l/454922-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-do-you-want-to-watch.png","/images/shots/l/454923-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-the-players-take-the-field.png","/images/shots/l/454924-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-running-down-the-field-with.png","/images/shots/l/454925-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-it-went-out-of-bounds-beside.png","/images/shots/l/454926-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-it-went-out-of-bounds-on-the.png","/images/shots/l/454927-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-being-thrown-in.png","/images/shots/l/454928-superstar-soccer-msx-screenshot-goooooal.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/169918-superstar-soccer-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169917-superstar-soccer-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169919-superstar-soccer-msx-media.jpg"]}
