{"name":"WEC Le Mans","description":"Recreating the famous Le Mans 24 race, although fortunately not in real-time. Although you\u0027re racing against the other cars, you must make each checkpoint in the required amount of time in order to complete the game. The lap is split into three sections, so the fourth section is identical to the first, the fifth to the second, and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the game goes on, the bonus time offered for each section drops, so you have to drive better as the game goes on to stay in. Night is represented as well, with everything darkened and the need for headlights. The circuit features barriers and trackside trees, so avoid contact with these, and try not to stray onto the grass as this slows you down.
