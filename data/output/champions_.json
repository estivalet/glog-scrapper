{"name":"Champions!","description":"Take control of a football team in a division below the top one, and try to lead them to glory in both league and European competition. You start with a squad of 12 players, whose names can be changed, but have room for 15 players in total, with chances to buy and sell players. You can take out a bank loan, the level of which depends on your division.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe team\u0027s formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, you can customise the team\u0027s strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division\u0027s other results. Finances change after each match to to wages, gate receipts, and possible incidents such as riots and illegal player approaches.","publishedBy":"Peaksoft","developedBy":"Peaksoft","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, Electron, Oric, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Sports, Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Football (European) / Soccer","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/champions_","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Peaksoft","developer":"Peaksoft","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Alternative Software Ltd.","developer":"Peaksoft","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 015103 860098","comments":"Budget re-release (As \u0027Soccer Boss\u0027)"}]}],"shot":[],"cover":["/images/covers/l/422615-champions-amstrad-cpc-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/422616-champions-amstrad-cpc-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/422617-champions-amstrad-cpc-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/422618-champions-amstrad-cpc-spine-sides.jpg","/images/covers/l/118675-champions-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118676-champions-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118674-champions-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120664-champions-msx-media.jpg","/images/covers/l/118909-champions-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118910-champions-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118908-champions-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120665-champions-msx-media.jpg"]}
