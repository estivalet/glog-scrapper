This time, your initial investigation of a dead body found floating in Tokyo Bay quickly leads you to follow the trail of clues to Hokkaido.  There, assisted by local police officer Shunsuke \u0026quot;Shun\u0026quot; Saruwatari, you will visit numerous popular real-life tourist attractions as you attempt to puzzle out the truth behind an ever-expanding series of murders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile maintaining the same first-person adventure format, this game drops the parser-driven interface used in earlier versions of the preceding title, instead introducing the menu system which was to become typical of Japanese adventure games.  The player selects from a number of simple commands (Go, Ask, Take, Show, Photograph, etc.) to find new evidence and advance the plot; also, the \u0026quot;Examine\u0026quot; command can (and sometimes must) be used to point at and examine specific spots in the scene pictured, so that the interface is not solely text-based.","publishedBy":"Login Soft","developedBy":"Armor Project","released":"Oct 18, 1985","alsoFor":"FM-7, NES, PC-88, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/hokkaid-rensa-satsujin-okhotsk-ni-kiyu","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Login Soft","developer":"Armor Project","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Oct 18, 1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
