{"name":"Romancia: Dragon Slayer Jr.","description":"In \u003ci\u003eRomancia: Dragon Slayer Jr.\u003c/i\u003e, you are a young warrior whom the king sends on a mission to rescue a lost princess. You must leave the town and enter the dreadful monster-infested catacombs in order to complete your quest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is a departure from \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/dragon-slayer\"\u003eDragon Slayer\u003c/a\u003e RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.","publishedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"NES, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/romancia-dragon-slayer-jr","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":"MSX1 version"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120438-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-title-screen-part.gif","/images/shots/l/136304-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-msx1-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/136305-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-msx2-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/120457-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-title-screen-part.gif","/images/shots/l/120439-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-outside-the-castle.gif","/images/shots/l/120440-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-i-suppose-you-couldn.gif","/images/shots/l/120441-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-that-s-a-hospital.gif","/images/shots/l/120442-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-gimme-the-best-room.gif","/images/shots/l/120443-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-heroes-also-need.gif","/images/shots/l/120444-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-what-the-hell-are.gif","/images/shots/l/120445-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-no-time-now-talk.gif","/images/shots/l/120446-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-it-was-a-wonderful.gif","/images/shots/l/120447-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-this-is-a-perfect.gif","/images/shots/l/120448-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-oh-no-water.gif","/images/shots/l/120449-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-i-think-i-m-guybrush.gif","/images/shots/l/120450-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-people-leave-in-dungeons.gif","/images/shots/l/120451-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-hi-there-my-new-friend.gif","/images/shots/l/120452-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-how-does-he-do-it.gif","/images/shots/l/120453-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-entering-a-dangerous.gif","/images/shots/l/120454-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-jumping-is-the-only.gif","/images/shots/l/120455-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-a-battle-in-an-appartment.gif","/images/shots/l/120456-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-battle-on-the-roof.gif","/images/shots/l/120437-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-screenshot-game-over.gif"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/285728-romancia-dragon-slayer-jr-msx-media.jpg"]}
