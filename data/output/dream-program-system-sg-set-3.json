{"name":"Dream Program System SG set 3","description":"\u003ci\u003eD.P.S. SG Set 3\u003c/i\u003e is the fourth entry in the \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dD%2eP%2eS%2e\"\u003e D.P.S./Dream Program System series\u003c/a\u003e. Like the other \u003ci\u003eD.P.S.\u003c/i\u003e games, it is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named \u003ci\u003eDream Program System\u003c/i\u003e. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe scenarios in this game include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003eA rather mundane depiction of a young couple\u0027s day directly after their wedding. The two return home and prepare for the \u0026quot;big event\u0026quot; in the night. The player can choose to control either the husband or the wife.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003eA story entitled \u003ci\u003eGraduation\u003c/i\u003e, which begins with a rather standard premise of a shy high school boy trying to express his love to a pretty school mate. However, the events take an unexpected turn when a dragon appears and the girl is hurt. The player can determine the personality of the hero before the start of the episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003eA bizarre fantasy tale with the title \u003ci\u003eRabbit P4P\u003c/i\u003e. The protagonist follows a mysterious \u0026quot;bunny girl\u0026quot; into a fairy tale-like realm, where he has to figure out what to do in order to win the graces of magical creatures, which look like young and pretty women. The personality choice influences the hero\u0027s attitude in this episode as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay is the same as in other \u003ci\u003eD.P.S.\u003c/i\u003e games. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are \u0026quot;neutral\u0026quot;, having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered \u0026quot;bad\u0026quot; by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.","publishedBy":"Alice Soft","developedBy":"Alice Soft","released":"1991","alsoFor":"FM Towns, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dream-program-system-sg-set-3","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Alice Soft","developer":"Alice Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":["/images/covers/l/260776-dream-program-system-sg-set-3-msx-front-cover.jpg"]}
