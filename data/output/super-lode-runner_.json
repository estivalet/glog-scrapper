{"name":"Super Lode Runner","description":"Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different \u003ci\u003eLode Runner\u003c/i\u003e arcade games in Japan, following the original arcade games release. Stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into \u003ci\u003eSuper Lode Runner\u003c/i\u003e for the MSX. The game also kept the two-player mode from the arcade version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game keeps the typical gameplay of the \u003ci\u003eLode Runner\u003c/i\u003e series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(This game shouldn\u0027t be confused with the NES game of the same title - it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.)","publishedBy":"Irem Corp.","developedBy":"Irem Corp.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/super-lode-runner_","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Irem Corp.","developer":"Irem Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/842394-super-lode-runner-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/842395-super-lode-runner-msx-screenshot-player-select.png","/images/shots/l/842396-super-lode-runner-msx-screenshot-first-level.png","/images/shots/l/842397-super-lode-runner-msx-screenshot-caught.png"],"cover":[]}
