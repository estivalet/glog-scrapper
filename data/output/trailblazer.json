{"name":"Trailblazer","description":"An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft\u0027s speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump and thus avoid these holes, although you have a limited number of them for each level, and it\u0027s possible to  adjust the speed through joystick or keyboard control. You also face a time limit on each of the levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one.","publishedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developedBy":"Mr Chip Software","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Behind view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/trailblazer","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developer":"Mr Chip Software","ported":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 013658 013105","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/181976-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/181977-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/181978-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-setup-menu.png","/images/shots/l/181979-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-entering-trail-zone-a.png","/images/shots/l/181980-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-yellow-speeds-you-up.png","/images/shots/l/181982-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-trail-zone-b.png","/images/shots/l/181983-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-disqualified.png","/images/shots/l/181985-trailblazer-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118593-trailblazer-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/119054-trailblazer-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120744-trailblazer-msx-media.jpg"]}
