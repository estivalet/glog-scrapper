Beside changing the battle system, the game\u0027s perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now.  New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.","publishedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","released":"1990","alsoFor":"Genesis, NES, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000, SNES, TurboGrafx CD | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"4 956027 050534","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120242-ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys-msx-screenshot-intro.gif"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/84392-ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/84393-ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/137552-ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys-msx-media.jpg","/images/covers/l/383121-ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys-msx-extras.jpg"]}
