{"name":"The Pro Yaky? Gekitotsu: Pennant Race","description":"\u003ci\u003eThe Pro YakyÅ« Gekitotsu: Pennant Race\u003c/i\u003e is a typical late 80-s baseball game. Just pick one of the fictional teams and  beat the opponent. Game modes include 1-player single match, 2-player game, and pennant mode (play the whole season). The player can edit stats of teams and save the resulting teams for later use on floppy disc. There\u0027s also an option to watch two CPU-controlled teams play versus each other. A notable feature is the lack of smooth scrolling, so the screen switches every time the ball reaches the edge of the screen.","publishedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action, Sports","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Baseball","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pro-yaky-gekitotsu-pennant-race","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Konami Industry Co.
