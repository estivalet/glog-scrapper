{"name":"Capit·n Sevilla","description":"Mariano Lopez, humble moustachioed vendor of \u003ci\u003emorcilla\u003c/i\u003e sausages, is subjected to the effects of a nuclear blast.  Unconscious, his rotund body lays on the road near his \u003ci\u003emorcillas\u003c/i\u003e and the scattered remains of his truck. Hours later he awakes, hungry, and ingests one of his radiation-imbued \u003ci\u003emorcillas\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what is this?! Mariano transforms: his muscles swell; his stature increases; his vulgar face re-arranges to present the visage of a handsome, dashing super-hero -- ready to fight the evil Professor Torrebruno!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the transformation of the hero, gameplay is as per the standard for side-scrolling platformers. The \u003ci\u003emorcilla\u003c/i\u003e sausages that trigger his transformation are scattered around the level, making Mariano (now the bold Capit√°n Sevilla!) impervious to damage until the sausage is fully consumed, leaving the player back in control of the vulnerable (and hungry!) Mariano.","publishedBy":"Dinamic†Software","developedBy":"Hi-Score","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum | Combined†View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person†[DEPRECATED], Side†view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/capitn-sevilla","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Dinamic Software","developer":"Hi-Score","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/135003-capitan-sevilla-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135004-capitan-sevilla-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135005-capitan-sevilla-msx-screenshot-watch-out-for-falling-objects.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118813-capitan-sevilla-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118814-capitan-sevilla-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118815-capitan-sevilla-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118812-capitan-sevilla-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120663-capitan-sevilla-msx-media.jpg"]}
