{"name":"Kick It!","description":"You are a pair of trousers. The screen is filled with a board game that has been subdivided into blue tiles. You can walk over them, but only once! The will disappear when you\u0027ve walked over them. Remember that! You have to collect them all... and don\u0027t get stuck! The randomly placed green rolling dam stones-like objects are also to be collected. But that\u0027s not all. The board contains three types of hazards. The first ones are the purple monsters, don\u0027t step on them or you \u0027ll get killed. The second hazard is the Man With The Hat, who is moving around the board. Don\u0027t let him catch you! The third danger are the randomly placed bombs on the board. You have thirty seconds to disarm them by grabbing them. If all tiles have been collected and you didn\u0027t get stuck: congratulations! Your off to the next level! The game contains digitized speech, which you will hear when the game starts, when your walked into an hazard and at Game Over.","publishedBy":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","developedBy":"Aackosoft International B.V.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action, Puzzle","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/kick-it","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developer":"Aackosoft International B.V.","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","developer":"Aackosoft International B.V.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Al Alamiah","developer":"Aackosoft International B.V.","ported":"","country":" Other","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131540-kick-it-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131541-kick-it-msx-screenshot-collect-the-blue-tiles-and-the-green.png","/images/shots/l/131542-kick-it-msx-screenshot-the-blue-tiles-disappear-you-can-t.png","/images/shots/l/131543-kick-it-msx-screenshot-watch-out-for-the-monsters.png","/images/shots/l/131544-kick-it-msx-screenshot-catch-the-bomb-before-time-runs-out.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118750-kick-it-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118749-kick-it-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120715-kick-it-msx-media.jpg"]}
