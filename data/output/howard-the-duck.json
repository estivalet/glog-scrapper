As Howard the Duck, master of Quack Fu, you need to make your way through the maze-like landscapes, and jump or fight the many obstacles blocking the path using kicks and punches. Water must be navigated around, because this \u0027superhero\u0027 duck can\u0027t swim. Or fly without the parachute you regularly use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuicksand, enemy mutants and more will all get in your way before you can finally parachute into the volcano and defeat the dark overlord!
