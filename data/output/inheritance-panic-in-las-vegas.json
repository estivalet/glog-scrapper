With the included airplane ticket he must travel to meet the notary and arrange the details of the inheritance.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas\u003c/b\u003e is a French adventure game, an early entry in the point-and-click sub-genre. The player moves a cursor in the screen with the \u003cb\u003eARROW KEYS\u003c/b\u003e, and interacts with objects by pressing the \u003cb\u003eSPACE\u003c/b\u003e bar. A handbag in the right side serves as the inventory and can be minimized to an icon at the bottom. The game is divided in three loads. At the end of each load, the player receives a password for the next one:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eâ?ºThe first load is entitled \u0026quot;\u003ci\u003eIn the building\u003c/i\u003e\u0026quot;, where the player must leave his apartment and go to the airport. The airplane leaves at 11:20, and this game section starts at 11:10. Besides this time limit, progress is further hindered by the other tenants that appear at each floor. They demand the return of borrowed goods. The player can search other apartments, steal money and threaten the other residents with weapons (this last option can lead to an instantaneous death).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eâ?º\u0026quot;\u003ci\u003eAt the airport\u003c/i\u003e\u0026quot; is the second load, where the player must embark on the airplane to Las Vegas.
