Along the way, the Capit√°n will have to face giant spiders, skeleton soldiers, enormous rats and a plethora of imaginative creatures such as the Abbot transformed into a demonic goat. The Capit√°n strives to triumph over all these opponents with the assistance of his friends sturdy Goliath, who though immobile can lash out with meaty fists and jump in place to cause earthquakes, and nimble Crisp√≠n, a man who can shimmy up a rope of any length.","publishedBy":"Dinamic†Software","developedBy":"Dinamic†Software","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined†View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person†[DEPRECATED], Side†view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/el-capitn-trueno","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Dinamic Software","developer":"Dinamic Software","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/432538-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-choose-part-one-or-part-two.png","/images/shots/l/432539-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/432540-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-main-menu-for-part-one.png","/images/shots/l/432541-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-starting-out-the-little-guy.png","/images/shots/l/432542-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-outside-the-castle.png","/images/shots/l/432543-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-i-found-a-switch-that-lowered.png","/images/shots/l/432544-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-energy-and.png","/images/shots/l/432545-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-when-you-kill-enemies-you.png","/images/shots/l/432549-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-main-menu-for-part-two.png","/images/shots/l/432546-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-starting-out-in-the-caves.png","/images/shots/l/432547-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-and-i-can-change-characters.png","/images/shots/l/432548-el-capitan-trueno-msx-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-energy-and.png"],"cover":[]}
