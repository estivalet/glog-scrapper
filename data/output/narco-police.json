{"name":"Narco Police","description":"In the 21st century, the world is virtually ruled by the drug barons. Your mission is to equip and position three squads of elite cops on the perimeter, and guide them through the enemy\u0027s network of tunnels. Once through you must level the factory with explosives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe loadout and starting positions are predefined, but you can change the loadout, choosing from two types of ammo, three types of rockets, explosives, first aid kits, transporters, and armor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.","publishedBy":"Dinamic Software","developedBy":"Dinamic Software","released":"1990","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, PC Booter, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"Behind view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/narco-police","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Dinamic Software","developer":"Dinamic Software","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/135362-narco-police-msx-screenshot-the-menu.png","/images/shots/l/135363-narco-police-msx-screenshot-the-weapons.png","/images/shots/l/135364-narco-police-msx-screenshot-the-map.png","/images/shots/l/135365-narco-police-msx-screenshot-enter-the-tunnel.png","/images/shots/l/135366-narco-police-msx-screenshot-enemies.png","/images/shots/l/135367-narco-police-msx-screenshot-shoot-the-bad-guys.png"],"cover":[]}
