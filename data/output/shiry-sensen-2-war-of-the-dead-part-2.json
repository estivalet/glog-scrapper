{"name":"Shiry? Sensen 2 - War of the Dead Part 2","description":"After the special agent Laila used her psychic powers to prevent a portal to hell from opening, the supernatural forces seem to have all but disappeared. However, a new threat has emerged instead. A nuclear power plant in the industrial city of Sun Dorado has been taken over by terrorists. Laila is entrusted with the task of dealing with them. Being a part of the S-SWAT organization, whose goal is to fight otherworldly creatures, Laila realizes that there must be a hellish force behind the terrorists. Indeed, it appears that monsters from Hades have somehow crossed over to our world. Will Laila be able to avert the grave threat one more time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eShiry≈? Sensen 2 - War of the Dead Part 2\u003c/i\u003e is a sequel to \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dShiry%c5%8d+Sensen+-+War+of+the+Dead\"\u003e Shiry≈? Sensen - War of the Dead\u003c/a\u003e. Gameplay-wise, it is quite different from its predecessor. RPG elements such as a \u0026quot;world map\u0026quot;, random encounters, heavy weapon and item management, etc. have been completely removed. The game is played entirely from top-down perspective, taking place in various districts of the large city. The gameplay can be described as a mixture of adventure and action elements. Laila has to explore the city, talk to characters, and sometimes procure items necessary to unlock a new location and advance the story. Combat is rather sparse, and is restricted to one enemy at a time. Battle mechanics are much simpler than in the first game, with Laila having only one gun, unlimited ammunition, and no jumping or ducking abilities.","publishedBy":"Victor†Musical†Industries,†Inc.","developedBy":"Fun†Project,†Inc.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"PC-88 | Combined†View","genre":"Action, Adventure","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/shiry-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Victor Musical Industries, Inc.","developer":"Fun Project, Inc.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/509405-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-title.png","/images/shots/l/509401-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-intro.png","/images/shots/l/509402-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-we-have.png","/images/shots/l/509403-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-laila.png","/images/shots/l/509404-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-buffy.png","/images/shots/l/509406-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-headquarters.png","/images/shots/l/509407-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-the.png","/images/shots/l/509408-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-central.png","/images/shots/l/509409-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-die.png","/images/shots/l/509410-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-oh-wow.png","/images/shots/l/509411-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-why.png","/images/shots/l/509412-shiryo-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2-msx-screenshot-ooookay.png"],"cover":[]}
