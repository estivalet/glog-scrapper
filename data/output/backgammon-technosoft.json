{"name":"Backgammon","description":"The classic board game of Backgammon. The game board is displayed from a top down perspective and is laid out horizontally. The game can be played in one or two player mode. In single player mode the player competes against a computer opponent. The objective of the game is to be the first player to move all fifteen of their pieces off of the board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe typical rules of Backgammon apply. Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponents pieces. Doing that will send their opponents piece back to their own home base. While it\u0027s a players turn, they can take back a move they made.","publishedBy":"Sony Computer Entertainment Japan","developedBy":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","released":"1984","alsoFor":"","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/backgammon-technosoft","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment Japan","developer":"Technosoft Co., Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/838842-backgammon-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/838843-backgammon-msx-screenshot-gameplay.png","/images/shots/l/838844-backgammon-msx-screenshot-player2-is-stuck.png"],"cover":[]}
