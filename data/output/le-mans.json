{"name":"Le Mans","description":"An early first-person-view racing game, \u003ci\u003eLe Mans\u003c/i\u003e purports to take you to the famous French race track, but not to a real-time recreation of the famous 24 hours race â?? instead, it\u0027s the \u0026quot;vingt-quatre minutes du Mans\u0026quot;. The game uses the usual \u0026quot;striped grass\u0026quot; effect to simulate speed. Push up on the joystick to accelerate, but don\u0027t drive too fast in the curves, or you will drive off the road and the car will flip over.","publishedBy":"Electric Software Limited","developedBy":"Electric Software Limited","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Tatung Einstein | Combined View","genre":"Racing / Driving","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/le-mans","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Electric Software Limited","developer":"Electric Software Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":"Cassette tape"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/717140-le-mans-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/717141-le-mans-msx-screenshot-starting-line.png","/images/shots/l/717144-le-mans-msx-screenshot-the-blue-cars-get-a-head-start.png","/images/shots/l/717145-le-mans-msx-screenshot-alone-on-the-starting-field.png","/images/shots/l/717148-le-mans-msx-screenshot-overtaking-a-blue-car.png","/images/shots/l/717149-le-mans-msx-screenshot-trying-to-take-a-curve.png","/images/shots/l/717153-le-mans-msx-screenshot-a-straight-section-here-you-can-give.png","/images/shots/l/717154-le-mans-msx-screenshot-a-tricky-curve.png","/images/shots/l/717155-le-mans-msx-screenshot-this-doesn-t-look-good.png","/images/shots/l/717156-le-mans-msx-screenshot-the-car-flipped.png"],"cover":[]}
