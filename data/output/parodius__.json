{"name":"Parodius","description":"\u003ci\u003eParodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth\u003c/i\u003e is the first game in the \u003ci\u003eParodius\u003c/i\u003e series, although this position is often confused with the better-known second game. \u0026quot;Parodius\u0026quot; is a portmanteau of \u0026quot;Gradius\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Parody,\u0026quot; and \u003ci\u003eParodius\u003c/i\u003e is a parody of \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/gradius\"\u003eGradius\u003c/a\u003e. Gameplay is similar to \u003ci\u003eGradius\u003c/i\u003e, a horizontal scrolling shooter, but you play as silly characters from Konami games and Japanese pop culture, such as Takosuke the octopus and the Penguin from \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/antarctic-adventure\"\u003eAntarctic Adventure\u003c/a\u003e. There are six stages with various obstacles and enemies, and it uses a similar selection-bar based power-up system to \u003ci\u003eGradius\u003c/i\u003e.","publishedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Wii, Wii U | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/parodius__","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Konami Industry Co.
