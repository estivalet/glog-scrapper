{"name":"Rush\u0027n Attack","description":"Depending on which title you use, and how you interpret it, this game is about a guy who a) rushes in before attacking b) attacks Russians (this was the mid-80s, when the US helped bin Laden do the same), or c) wears a rather goofy hat. One way or another, this arcade game arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.","publishedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Atari 8-bit, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, DOS, NES, Thomson MO, Thomson TO, Xbox 360, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/rushn-attack","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Konami Industry Co.
