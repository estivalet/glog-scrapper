Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes,  tanks and ground targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can\u0027t use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.","publishedBy":"Grandslam Entertainments Ltd.","developedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","released":"1990","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Atari ST, Commodore 64, SEGA Master System, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/scramble-spirits","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Grandslam Entertainments Ltd.","developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","ported":"Teque Software Development Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"5 013248 003080","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/200241-scramble-spirits-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/200242-scramble-spirits-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png"],"cover":[]}
