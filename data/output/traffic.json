{"name":"Traffic","description":"\u003ci\u003eTraffic\u003c/i\u003e is a simple game where the player has to guide cars, motorbikes and buses through busy London streets by changing the traffic lights from red to green. The objective in order to advance to the next level is to get a preset number of vehicles through the screen, although it does not matter which exit you direct them through. Cars continue to queue off the edges of the screen (with numbers next to them if there are queued cars beyond your vision) and if the queue reach more than five cars, it\u0027s game over. A warning sound is given when five cars are queued; you must hope there are not also queues on surrounding roads. Cars always stay on their side of the road, and collisions are not possible.","publishedBy":"Sony Corporation","developedBy":"Andromeda Software","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/traffic","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sony Corporation","developer":"Andromeda Software","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/445531-traffic-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/445532-traffic-msx-screenshot-ready-to-start-map-1.png","/images/shots/l/445533-traffic-msx-screenshot-i-ve-got-the-traffic-flowing-so-far.png","/images/shots/l/445534-traffic-msx-screenshot-top-right-more-than-5-queued-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
