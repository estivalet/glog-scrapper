The player must construct and destroy blocks in order to access the key that opens the door to the next stage. As opposed to \u003ci\u003eSolomon\u0027s Key\u003c/i\u003e, blocks can only be built diagonally upwards, like stairs. Deleted blocks can be used to trap wandering enemies. The protagonist can also wear armor that protects him from projectile attacks.
