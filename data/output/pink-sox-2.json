It includes the continuation of the sci-fi Japanese-style adventure (entitled \u003ci\u003eWho Is There?\u003c/i\u003e) from the \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/pink-sox\"\u003eprevious game\u003c/a\u003e; another scenario in the mini-adventure \u003ci\u003eHalftime Lover\u003c/i\u003e; a simple card game of a slightly different variety (the goal is to run out of cards by selecting those of a higher value than the opponent\u0027s); and a mini-game that combines elements of quiz with tile-matching puzzle, leading to an erotic image different from the one in the first game.","publishedBy":"Wendy Magazine","developedBy":"Wendy Magazine","released":"Mar 03, 1990","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Compilation","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pink-sox-2","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Wendy Magazine","developer":"Wendy Magazine","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Mar 03, 1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
