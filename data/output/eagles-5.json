{"name":"Eagles 5","description":"\u003ci\u003eEagles 5\u003c/i\u003e is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up loosely based on the Japanese anime series \u003ci\u003eGatchaman\u003c/i\u003e. Characters from the anime are featured on the game\u0027s cover and in the background story; however, in the game itself the player controls a spaceship flying through deep space levels with identical background. The ship is protected by a shield, which effectively grants it a HP bar. Power-ups that upgrade the ship\u0027s weaponry can be found in the stages. However, the weapon reverts to its default shape when the ship is hit by the enemy. There are no continues in the game: when the ship\u0027s hit points are depleted, the game must be restarted from the beginning.","publishedBy":"Zemina Co.","developedBy":"","released":"Jul, 1990","alsoFor":"SEGA Master System | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/eagles-5","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Zemina Co.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" South Korea","releaseDate":"Jul, 1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
