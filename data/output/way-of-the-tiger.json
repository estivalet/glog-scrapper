{"name":"The Way of the Tiger","description":"Three distinct side-scrolling beat \u0027em up game sections await in this title, licensed from a series of Fighting Fantasy-style books. As Avenger, you must clear the world of evil so as to protect the innocent, using your superior strength. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe combat is split into Hand-to-Hand, Pole Fighting and Samurai Sword fighting, each of which are loaded separately from across 2 cassettes - a novelty at the time. In each mode there are 16 moves available, varying depending on whether fire (or the space bar in keyboard mode) is pressed. The moves are arranged logically, and reverse depending on the character\u0027s facing direction, similarly to the Exploding Fist games.","publishedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, Thomson MO, Thomson TO, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/way-of-the-tiger","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 013658 013037","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/445120-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main.png","/images/shots/l/445121-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-starting-the-unarmed-combat.png","/images/shots/l/445122-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-hi-ya.png","/images/shots/l/445123-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-he-s-down-for-the-count.png","/images/shots/l/445124-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-this-goblin-is-my-next.png","/images/shots/l/445125-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-the-goblin-turns-into.png","/images/shots/l/445126-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-hmm-has-he-prepared-a.png","/images/shots/l/445127-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-my-third-opponent-looks.png","/images/shots/l/445128-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-my-first-opponent-for.png","/images/shots/l/445129-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-i-went-splash.png","/images/shots/l/445130-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-my-second-bojutsu-opponent.png","/images/shots/l/445131-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-ready-for-kendo.png","/images/shots/l/445132-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-my-first-kendo-opponent.png","/images/shots/l/445133-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-screenshot-my-second-kendo-opponent.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118584-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118583-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120748-the-way-of-the-tiger-msx-media.jpg"]}
