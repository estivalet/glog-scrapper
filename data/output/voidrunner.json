{"name":"Voidrunner","description":"The final conflict in the droid wars is up ahead in Jeff Minter\u0027s Voidrunner, the second sequel to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/gridrunner\"\u003eGridrunner\u003c/a\u003e. After the defeat in the \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dMatrix\"\u003eMatrix\u003c/a\u003e wars the droids are out for revenge, preparing a nuke to destroy the earth. Therefore a corps of pilots are sent to the droid home planet with the objective to eliminate every single droid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGameplay is similar to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/gridrunner\"\u003eGridrunner\u003c/a\u003e. Like in \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dCentipede\"\u003eCentipede\u003c/a\u003e, the enemies move in a pattern down the screen and the player have to shoot them before they reach the ship. There\u0027s also the zapper, a vertically moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happen, it will die.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe enemies come in many different flavours. The most common ones just explodes when hit, bouncing predictable around the screen. We also have the Gridrunner style aliens that when hit leaves a pod that needs to be destroyed. Typical for a Minter games, you\u0027ll also fight furry animals like camels and goats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew in Voidrunner is that you don\u0027t just have one ship, but four. In early levels the ships will move around in a cluster. Later in the game some of your ships will have inverted motion. Some of these formations will have the ships shooting in different directions. Handy when you have enemies coming in from behind.","publishedBy":"M.A.D.","developedBy":"Llamasoft Ltd.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED], Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/voidrunner","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"M.A.D.","developer":"Llamasoft Ltd.","ported":"Icon Design Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012967 710064","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/164430-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-control-selection.png","/images/shots/l/164422-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-enter-yak-level-first-level.png","/images/shots/l/164423-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/164424-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-and-it-has-begun.png","/images/shots/l/164421-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-being-resurrected.png","/images/shots/l/164425-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-watch-out-for-the-falling-bomb.png","/images/shots/l/164426-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-they-re-getting-close.png","/images/shots/l/164428-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-some-enemies-attack-vertically.png","/images/shots/l/164427-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-and-some-diagonally.png","/images/shots/l/164429-voidrunner-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118715-voidrunner-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118716-voidrunner-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118714-voidrunner-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120731-voidrunner-msx-media.jpg"]}
