Yuko fights and jumps her way through enemies and platform structures, acquiring various power-ups during the course of the game. Various weapons and armor can be found in the stages and equipped on a separate screen. Weapons have their own unique ranged patterns and are always attached to Yuko\u0027s default sword attack. Different types of armor may increase Yuko\u0027s hit points, offense, and defense ratings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYuko can also acquire and execute special attacks and techniques, such as for example an ability that freezes all the enemies on screen for a limited amount of time.
