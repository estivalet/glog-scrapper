{"name":"Arctic","description":"\u003ci\u003eArctic\u003c/i\u003e is an action puzzle game that describes itself as \u0026quot;active rail playing\u0026quot;. Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage\u0027s features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.","publishedBy":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","developedBy":"Artdink Corporation","released":"Jul 21, 1989","alsoFor":"FM-7, NES, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined View","genre":"Action, Puzzle","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/arctic","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","developer":"Artdink Corporation","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Jul 21, 1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
