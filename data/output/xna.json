{"name":"X?na","description":"Tetsu is a young warrior who has left his home country in order to serve human rulers in their battle against the dark elves. But one day the valiant knight was heavily wounded in battle. Unconscious, he was found by a female fighter named Mei, who brought him to her house and cured him. Grateful, Tetsu promises Mei to help her venture into the huge tower standing nearby, which was built by the princess of the country and is now overrun by monsters...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eXã?»na\u003c/i\u003e is a dungeon crawler very similar to early \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dDragon+Knight\"\u003e Dragon Knight\u003c/a\u003e games, but without erotic content. Most of the activity in the game takes place in the gigantic maze-like tower. The player has to explore it, finding the correct way to upper floors (without auto-map feature). In town, it is possible to buy weapons and rest. The player controls only Tetsu and Mei during the entire game, as they fight random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining levels. The combat system is very simple, relying on preparation and level-building. Mei can cast healing magic, which depletes magic points (MP).","publishedBy":"FairyTale","developedBy":"FairyTale","released":"1991","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/xna","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"FairyTale","developer":"FairyTale","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
