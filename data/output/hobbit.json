{"name":"The Hobbit","description":"Relive Tolkien\u0027s The Hobbit as Bilbo Baggins.  A piece of  Interactive fiction (with graphics to illustrate locations), you follow the plot of Tolkien\u0027s book (before the Lord of the Rings trilogy), starting with an encounter with Gandalf and Thorin.  The other characters can make their own moves independently of the player and their actions can sometimes result in a situation where it is not possible to complete the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe implementation is rich enough that you can play entirely without pictures if you wish.  Also, gameplay happens in realtime, uncommon for interactive fiction.  The game\u0027s parser, called Inglish took as long to develop as the rest of the game.","publishedBy":"Melbourne House","developedBy":"Beam Software Pty., Ltd.","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Apple II, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Macintosh, Oric, PC Booter, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/hobbit","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Melbourne House","developer":"Beam Software Pty., Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"9 780861 616930","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131247-the-hobbit-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131248-the-hobbit-msx-screenshot-gandalph-gives-you.png","/images/shots/l/131249-the-hobbit-msx-screenshot-talk.png","/images/shots/l/510512-the-hobbit-msx-screenshot-trolls-clearing.png","/images/shots/l/510514-the-hobbit-msx-screenshot-trolls-cave.png","/images/shots/l/510515-the-hobbit-msx-screenshot-at-the-gate-of-mirkwood.png","/images/shots/l/510516-the-hobbit-msx-screenshot-trees-that-look-like-they-re-in.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/167090-the-hobbit-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120732-the-hobbit-msx-media.jpg"]}
