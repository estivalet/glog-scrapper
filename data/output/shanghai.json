The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.","publishedBy":"SystemSoft","developedBy":"Activision, Inc.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Apple IIgs, Arcade, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, FM Towns, Lynx, Macintosh, NES, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1, SEGA Master System, Sharp X68000, TurboGrafx-16, TRS-80 CoCo, Wii | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/shanghai","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"SystemSoft","developer":"Activision, Inc.","ported":"SystemSoft","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/214535-shanghai-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/214536-shanghai-msx-screenshot-click-on-a-tile.png","/images/shots/l/214537-shanghai-msx-screenshot-no-match.png","/images/shots/l/214538-shanghai-msx-screenshot-game-options.png"],"cover":[]}
