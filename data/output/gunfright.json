The objective is to collect a bounty by finding and eliminating wanted criminals that are harassing the town. Innocent bystanders will point to the direction of the criminal, shooting them will result in a fine reducing your score. A horse can be obtained to speed up the chase. Once the wanted criminal is encountered, the game again switches to a first person cross hair view, where the first to draw will be the winner. Taking out the criminal will give you a reward that helps you with future expenditures as the cost of ammo and horses changes as the game goes along. Your final tally will become your score at the game\u0027s end.","publishedBy":"Ultimate - Play the Game","developedBy":"Ultimate - Play the Game","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Bird\u0027s-eye view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/gunfright","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Ultimate - Play the Game","developer":"Ultimate - Play the Game","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/793109-gunfright-msx-screenshot-gameplay-in-the-isometric-environment.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/330300-gunfright-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/330301-gunfright-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
