{"name":"The Day II","description":"The android terrorist organization Metalabor stole the highly valuable Mega Plutonium K element, intending to use it for military purposes. Their biggest mistake, however, was kidnapping the sister of the pilot Captain Lee in order to force their father, a famous scientist, to aid them in their nefarious plans. Captain Lee decides to rescue his sister alone, and perhaps find a way to stop Metalabor altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Day II\u003c/i\u003e is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up and (notwithstanding its title) the first entry in the Korean-made series. The player controls a different spaceship in every mission, though they play nearly identically (with the exception of the range of the smart bombs). Different weapons and power-ups (such as a life-adding item) can be collected throughout the stages. Each mission ends with a boss battle. The game features three selectable difficulty levels.","publishedBy":"Man c.c.","developedBy":"Mirinae Software Inc.","released":"1991","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/day-ii","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Man c.c.","developer":"Mirinae Software Inc.","ported":"","country":" South Korea","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
