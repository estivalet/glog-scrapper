Each fruit if collected is collected in order and you are told which fruit is next and when you want to leave the screen then a key must be collected before leaving by a locked door. Also on the screen are various creatures and monsters and these can be avoided or shot with your laser but you can only fire left or right. If you touch a creature or allow a timer to reach zero then you lose one of three lives.","publishedBy":"Mind Games Espa\u0026Atilde;\u0026plusmn;a S.A.","developedBy":"Krypton Force ","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Commodore 64 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/forbidden-fruit","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Mind Games Espa\u0026Atilde;\u0026plusmn;a S.A.","developer":"Krypton Force ","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/842540-forbidden-fruit-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/842541-forbidden-fruit-msx-screenshot-first-level.png","/images/shots/l/842542-forbidden-fruit-msx-screenshot-second-level.png","/images/shots/l/842543-forbidden-fruit-msx-screenshot-third-level.png"],"cover":[]}
