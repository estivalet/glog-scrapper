{"name":"Blagger","description":"In this game, players control Rodger the Dodger (aka: Blagger), a burglar whose task is to collect a series of keys in a certain location, then use them to open the safe. There are 30 levels to be completed. Blagger must perform these tasks under a time limit while avoiding hazards such as cacti, cars, aliens, mad hatters, giant mouths, and chinamen. Blagger has no weapon to shoot these, but must rely on his jumping skills. He loses a life if he comes into contact with a hazard or falls long distances, or if he runs out of time. As usual, the game ends when all lives are lost. If Blagger successfully grabs the keys and makes his way to the safe, he proceeds to the next location.","publishedBy":"Alligata Software Ltd.","developedBy":"Alligata Software Ltd.","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, Electron | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/blagger","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Alligata Software Ltd.","developer":"Alligata Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","developer":"Alligata Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":"Cartridge"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/291024-blagger-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/291025-blagger-msx-screenshot-start-screen.png","/images/shots/l/291026-blagger-msx-screenshot-the-bank.png","/images/shots/l/291027-blagger-msx-screenshot-sweet-shop.png","/images/shots/l/291028-blagger-msx-screenshot-reactor.png","/images/shots/l/291029-blagger-msx-screenshot-invaders-from-space.png","/images/shots/l/291030-blagger-msx-screenshot-the-vaults.png","/images/shots/l/291031-blagger-msx-screenshot-our-logo.png","/images/shots/l/291032-blagger-msx-screenshot-the-cobblers.png","/images/shots/l/291033-blagger-msx-screenshot-candy-from-a-baby.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/117716-blagger-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117715-blagger-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120742-blagger-msx-media.jpg"]}
