On the graveyard, near your mother\u0027s grave, you hear a mysterious voice urging you to enter the flooded Greek temple. Naturally, these turn out to be typical \u003ci\u003eBomberman\u003c/i\u003e arenas, filled with destructible square terrain, wandering monsters of different kinds, and power-ups as well as power-downs. In order to progress in your quest, you must bomb your way through these arenas, picking up items that will open the door to the next level. There are several worlds to progress through in this adventure mode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the multiplayer mode, up to four players can play at once, on joysticks and keyboard, in a tournament where the last one standing wins the match, and the tournament is won by the one with most victories. If the match goes on for too long, the walls of the arena start to close in, forcing the contestants closer together or swallowing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game features many bells and whistles, such as a jukebox in the disco in the village, a map editor and support for modern hardware such as the Moonsound sound module, hard disk support and sampled sound effects.","publishedBy":"Sunrise for MSX","developedBy":"Team Bomba","released":"Jan 17, 2004","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/bombaman","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sunrise for MSX","developer":"Team Bomba","ported":"","country":" The Netherlands","releaseDate":"Jan 17, 2004","ean13":"","comments":"Released on MSX fair in Oss"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/719255-bombaman-msx-screenshot-the-intro.png","/images/shots/l/719257-bombaman-msx-screenshot-iko-iko-island-where-the-protagonist.png","/images/shots/l/719258-bombaman-msx-screenshot-the-protagonist-is-an-orphan.png","/images/shots/l/719263-bombaman-msx-screenshot-the-game-starts-out-as-a-typical-top.png","/images/shots/l/719265-bombaman-msx-screenshot-i-wonder-if-it-s-even-possible-to.png","/images/shots/l/719266-bombaman-msx-screenshot-indeed.png","/images/shots/l/719270-bombaman-msx-screenshot-a-mysterious-voice-in-the-grave-yard.png","/images/shots/l/719271-bombaman-msx-screenshot-entering-the-first-world.png","/images/shots/l/719273-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-1.png","/images/shots/l/719275-bombaman-msx-screenshot-found-the-exit.png","/images/shots/l/719276-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-02.png","/images/shots/l/719278-bombaman-msx-screenshot-blowing-up-an-enemy.png","/images/shots/l/719280-bombaman-msx-screenshot-blowing-up-yourself.png","/images/shots/l/719282-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-3.png","/images/shots/l/719283-bombaman-msx-screenshot-found-an-extra-life.png","/images/shots/l/719288-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-4.png","/images/shots/l/719290-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-5.png","/images/shots/l/719292-bombaman-msx-screenshot-passwords-are-granted-at-intervals.png","/images/shots/l/719294-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-6.png","/images/shots/l/719295-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-6.png","/images/shots/l/719298-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-7.png","/images/shots/l/719299-bombaman-msx-screenshot-continue.png","/images/shots/l/719300-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-8.png","/images/shots/l/719301-bombaman-msx-screenshot-level-1-9.png","/images/shots/l/719302-bombaman-msx-screenshot-after-one-minute-all-the-plants-are.png","/images/shots/l/719303-bombaman-msx-screenshot-lots-of-bonuses-here.png","/images/shots/l/719285-bombaman-msx-screenshot-game-over.png","/images/shots/l/719304-bombaman-msx-screenshot-setting-up-a-multiplayer-game.png","/images/shots/l/719305-bombaman-msx-screenshot-ready.png","/images/shots/l/719306-bombaman-msx-screenshot-only-two-opponents-remain.png","/images/shots/l/719309-bombaman-msx-screenshot-the-screen-starts-shrinking.png","/images/shots/l/719310-bombaman-msx-screenshot-very-close-now.png","/images/shots/l/719311-bombaman-msx-screenshot-red-wins.png","/images/shots/l/719312-bombaman-msx-screenshot-another-close-call.png","/images/shots/l/719313-bombaman-msx-screenshot-it-s-a-draw.png","/images/shots/l/719314-bombaman-msx-screenshot-the-odds-are-even.png","/images/shots/l/719315-bombaman-msx-screenshot-green-has-just-fallen.png","/images/shots/l/719317-bombaman-msx-screenshot-blue-wins.png","/images/shots/l/719260-bombaman-msx-screenshot-levels-can-be-made-using-an-external.png"],"cover":[]}
