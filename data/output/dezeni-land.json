{"name":"Dezeni Land","description":"\u003ci\u003eDezeni Land\u003c/i\u003e is a text adventure with graphics. The game\u0027s nameless protagonist must visit six attractions parodying well-known areas of Tokyo Disneyland of the early 1980\u0027s, find the treasures within and escape. The title itself is a pun involving Disney and a Japanese expression referring showing off one\u0027s wealth. The gameplay largely follows the standards of interactive fiction, including simple verb-noun combinations as well as directions (forward, back, left, and right) for navigation. The areas are accessed in a linear fashion; items needed to advance to the next attraction can only be founded in an earlier explored location.","publishedBy":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","developedBy":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","released":"1984","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-6001, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dezeni-land","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/839088-dezeni-land-msx-screenshot-want-to-load-a-save-file.png","/images/shots/l/839089-dezeni-land-msx-screenshot-beginning-of-game.png"],"cover":[]}
