{"name":"Can Can Bunny Superior","description":"The second game in the \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dCan+can+bunny\"\u003e Can Can Bunny\u003c/a\u003e series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. \u0026quot;Oh, if only I could get her\u0026quot;, sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi\u0027s wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompared to the first game, \u003ci\u003eCan Can Bunny Superior\u003c/i\u003e plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like \u0026quot;Look\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Move\u0026quot;, etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.","publishedBy":"Cocktail Soft","developedBy":"Cocktail Soft","released":"Apr 16, 1990","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/can-can-bunny-superior","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Cocktail Soft","developer":"Cocktail Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Apr 16, 1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/671335-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/671328-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-intro.png","/images/shots/l/671329-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-takeshi-is-watching.png","/images/shots/l/671334-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-arisu-appears-with-a.png","/images/shots/l/671337-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-starting-a-game.png","/images/shots/l/671338-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-scenario-2-takes-place.png","/images/shots/l/671339-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-met-a-girl-in-the-lobby.png","/images/shots/l/671341-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-a-shy-girl-in-the-garden.png","/images/shots/l/671342-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-the-pool-is-empty.png","/images/shots/l/671343-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-scenario-3-takes-place.png","/images/shots/l/671345-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-this-is-bob-your-personal.png","/images/shots/l/671346-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-going-for-a-ride-with.png","/images/shots/l/671356-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-bob-gives-some-advice.png","/images/shots/l/671357-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-it-worked-out.png","/images/shots/l/671358-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-where-did-the-others.png","/images/shots/l/671359-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-taking-sayuri-to-a-lonely.png","/images/shots/l/671362-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-alone-with-keiko.png","/images/shots/l/671363-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-going-for-a-ride-in.png","/images/shots/l/671353-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-where-do-you-want-to.png","/images/shots/l/671354-can-can-bunny-superior-msx-screenshot-no-comments.png"],"cover":[]}
