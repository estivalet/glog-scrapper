{"name":"Angle Ball","description":"Angleball is a variation on Pool, using a hexagonal table with 6 pockets and 6 sides. The ball can rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.","publishedBy":"M.A.D.","developedBy":"","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Sports","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Pool / Snooker","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/angle-ball","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"M.A.D.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012967 710095","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/135379-angle-ball-msx-screenshot-title-and-options-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135380-angle-ball-msx-screenshot-select-the-starting-frame.png","/images/shots/l/135381-angle-ball-msx-screenshot-determine-the-angle-of-the-ball.png","/images/shots/l/135382-angle-ball-msx-screenshot-determine-where-to-hit-the-ball.png","/images/shots/l/135383-angle-ball-msx-screenshot-determine-the-power-of-your-shot.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118672-angle-ball-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118673-angle-ball-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118671-angle-ball-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120669-angle-ball-msx-media.jpg"]}
