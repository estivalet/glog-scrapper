{"name":"Laserfight!","description":"\u003ci\u003eLaserfight!\u003c/i\u003e is a horizontally-scrolling shooter that is exceptionally similar to the classic \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/gradius\"\u003eGradius\u003c/a\u003e. The visual design and power-up system are both reminiscent of Konami\u0027s well-known title. There is a gauge along the bottom of the screen which increases when a power-up is picked up. Each level of the gauge will activate a different weapon, with the last level switching to another set of weapons. There are three weapon sets in all for a total of nine weapons, including lasers, reflect shots, and 4-way shots; each weapon set also has a \u0026quot;speed up\u0026quot; option. Gradius\u0027 trademark ship-following \u0026quot;options\u0026quot; are also present. Each stage consists of numerous obstacles and enemies which must be destroyed and maneuvered around. At the end of each stage is a large boss.","publishedBy":"Takeru","developedBy":"","released":"1989","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/laserfight","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Takeru","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
