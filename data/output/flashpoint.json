{"name":"Flashpoint","description":"\u003ci\u003eFlashpoint\u003c/i\u003e is a \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dTetris\"\u003eTetris\u003c/a\u003e variant. The various shapes of the falling blocks and their rotation are identical to the prototype. What makes the game different from a standard Tetris clone is its objective. Each stage already contains a pattern of blocks, usually arranged as symbols, characters, or other images. Among these blocks are several bombs. The goal is to make these bombs detonate by clearing out the rows they are in. Once all the bombs have been detonated, the stage \u0026quot;explodes\u0026quot;, and the player advances to the next one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe speed of the falling blocks gradually increases if it takes the player too long to complete a single stage. However, it reverts to the default with each new stage. There are 90 stages altogether. Two-player gameplay is available as well.","publishedBy":"Zemina Co.","developedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","released":"Jan, 1991","alsoFor":"Arcade, SEGA Master System | Combined View","genre":"Action, Puzzle","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/flashpoint","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Zemina Co.","developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","ported":"","country":" South Korea","releaseDate":"Jan, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
