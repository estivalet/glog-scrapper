{"name":"The Dam Busters","description":"\u003ci\u003eDam Busters\u003c/i\u003e is an early flight simulation, set in World War II. It focuses on Dam Busters who historically were used to heavily bombard strategic objectives, in this case dams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won\u0027t be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!","publishedBy":"Comptiq","developedBy":"Sydney Development Corp.","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Coleco Adam, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, DOS, PC-98, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Simulation, Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dam-busters","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Comptiq","developer":"Sydney Development Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":"Cartridge"},{"publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","developer":"Sydney Development Corp.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":"Cassette"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/130763-the-dam-busters-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/130764-the-dam-busters-msx-screenshot-control-center.png","/images/shots/l/130765-the-dam-busters-msx-screenshot-select-target.png","/images/shots/l/130766-the-dam-busters-msx-screenshot-the-file.png","/images/shots/l/130767-the-dam-busters-msx-screenshot-great-britain.png","/images/shots/l/130768-the-dam-busters-msx-screenshot-start-bombing.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/120961-the-dam-busters-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120962-the-dam-busters-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120963-the-dam-busters-msx-media.jpg"]}
