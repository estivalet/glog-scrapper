{"name":"Spelunker","description":"In this game, you are a spelunker who climbs deep down mountain caves in search for treasure. The levels consist of many platforms, connected to each other by a riding cart, ladders, ropes, etc. You\u0027ll have to time your jumping well, because a slight fall will lead to your death, and the abyss is near! You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use inventory items such as dynamite to create obstacle-destroying explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired treasure.","publishedBy":"Br\u0026Atilde;\u0026cedil;derbund Software, Inc.","developedBy":"Micro Graphic Image","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Arcade, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, NES, Nintendo 3DS, Wii, Wii U | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/spelunker","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Br\u0026Atilde;\u0026cedil;derbund Software, Inc.","developer":"Micro Graphic Image","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/130160-spelunker-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/130161-spelunker-msx-screenshot-jump-over-enemies.png","/images/shots/l/130162-spelunker-msx-screenshot-pick-up-the-items.png","/images/shots/l/130163-spelunker-msx-screenshot-use-the-elevator-to-move-up-or-down.png"],"cover":[]}
