{"name":"Thexder","description":"A platform shooter from Japan, \u003ci\u003eThexder\u003c/i\u003e offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty. You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a mech into a jet at any time. Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargeable energy; if you run out of this energy, you\u0027ll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again. Your mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.","publishedBy":"Game Arts Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"Game Arts Co., Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIgs, DOS, FM-7, Macintosh, NES, PC-8000, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp MZ-80B/2000/2500, Sharp X1, TRS-80 CoCo | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/thexder","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Eaglesoft","developer":"Game Arts Co., Ltd.","ported":"Compile","country":" The Netherlands","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Game Arts Co., Ltd.","developer":"Game Arts Co., Ltd.","ported":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/123573-thexder-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/123574-thexder-msx-screenshot-beginning-the-game.png","/images/shots/l/123575-thexder-msx-screenshot-yikes-under-attack.png","/images/shots/l/123576-thexder-msx-screenshot-hmm-lost-in-a-maze.png","/images/shots/l/123577-thexder-msx-screenshot-blasting-through-this-wall.png","/images/shots/l/123578-thexder-msx-screenshot-flying-underneath-some-trouble.png","/images/shots/l/123579-thexder-msx-screenshot-another-confusing-maze.png","/images/shots/l/123580-thexder-msx-screenshot-ahhh-homing-missiles.png","/images/shots/l/123581-thexder-msx-screenshot-shooting-some-enemies-will-replenish.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/327857-thexder-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327858-thexder-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
