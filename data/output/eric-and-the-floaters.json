{"name":"Eric and the Floaters","description":"The first title in the \u003ci\u003eBomberman\u003c/i\u003e series, released as \u003ci\u003eEric and the Floaters\u003c/i\u003e in the UK, introduces the gameplay concept the series is known for, but otherwise bears little resemblance to the later, more famous entries, with series mascot the White Bomberman nowhere in sight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game includes 20 single-screen levels. Each consists of a regular grid of indestructible walls, randomly placed destructible walls, and enemies (Floaters) moving between them. The goal of the Bomberman (or Eric in the UK version) is to kill all Floaters present in order to advance to the next stage. There is only one Floater in the first level, but their numbers rise in later stages. To destroy them, Bomberman can drop a bomb at the push of a button, which goes off after a few seconds, hopefully vanquishing an enemy and not himself. If a bomb destroys a wall, hidden items may be revealed, including a treasure chest to be collected for bonus points. The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others. When they turn red, they follow Bomberman around, which can be used to lure them into strategically placed bombs. Some levels add an extra twist by making Bomberman drop his bombs automatically instead of manually.","publishedBy":"Al Alamiah","developedBy":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","released":"1984","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-6001, PC-88, Sharp MZ-80K/700/800/1500, Sharp X1, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/eric-and-the-floaters","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Kuma Computers Ltd.","developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Al Alamiah","developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Other","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Hudson Soft Ltd.","developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/130082-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/130083-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-screenshot-blow-up-the-walls.png","/images/shots/l/130084-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-screenshot-don-t-stand-to-close.png","/images/shots/l/139172-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-screenshot-the-alternate-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/139173-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-screenshot-two-erics-left.png","/images/shots/l/139174-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-screenshot-two-enemies-in-stage.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/169863-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169862-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169864-eric-and-the-floaters-msx-media.jpg"]}
