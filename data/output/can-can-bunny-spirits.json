One night he sits at home and stares at the moon. Suddenly, the magic fairy Ariko appears in front of him and gives him... no, this time not the Magic Book, but a Magic Crescent! With the help of this crescent, the hero can turn into totally different young men - which will naturally increase his chances in impressing girls and ultimately having sex with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eCan Can Bunny Spirits\u003c/i\u003e is much less of an adventure and more of a strategy game than its predecessors. Success depends even more on the preparations before the actual decisive stage. There is also extensive customization in this game. In the beginning, the hero chooses what he wants to be like, which includes age, height, blood type, and other parameters. Then Ariko introduces several girls to him, of which he has to choose one. Afterwards, it\u0027s a matter of asking the right questions and giving the right answers, combining knowledge of the girl\u0027s preferences and of the character\u0027s statistics. Each girl has a \u0026quot;love meter that can be raised or lowered depending on the player\u0027s strategies, and once it is full, the hero can have his way with the girl.","publishedBy":"Cocktail Soft","developedBy":"Cocktail Soft","released":"1991","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/can-can-bunny-spirits","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Cocktail Soft","developer":"Cocktail Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
