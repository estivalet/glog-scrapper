{"name":"Las Vegas Video Poker","description":"With 20 coins in your hand, you approach the electronic poker machine confidently, with the aim of making a killing. There are several winning hands, with a Royal Flush paying out at 250-1, a Royal Flush at 50-1 and Four of a Kind at 20-1. Smaller winnings can be scored with multiple pairs or pairs of \u0027face cards\u0027. There are five skill levels, and four different values of money to play with. After the initial draw you can choose which cards to hold in the hope of getting the best possible combination together. There is no opponent to play, and thus no bluffing involved.","publishedBy":"Entertainment USA","developedBy":"","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/las-vegas-video-poker","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Entertainment USA","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012967 700614","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/445086-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/445087-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main.png","/images/shots/l/445088-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-select-a-coin-value.png","/images/shots/l/445089-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-press-return-to-start.png","/images/shots/l/445090-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-these-are-your-odds-payouts.png","/images/shots/l/445091-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-the-cards-are-dealt.png","/images/shots/l/445092-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-so-far-i-have-a-pair.png","/images/shots/l/445093-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-when-you-win-the-cards.png","/images/shots/l/445094-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-a-full-house-pays-21.png","/images/shots/l/445095-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-screenshot-well-that-didn-t-go-well.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/94161-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/94163-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/94164-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/94165-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/94162-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/94166-las-vegas-video-poker-msx-media.jpg"]}
