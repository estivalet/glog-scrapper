{"name":"Bank Buster","description":"The only way to break into a well-stocked bank is to head underground, and smash your way through layer after layer of earth. This makes for a game influenced by \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dBreakout\"\u003eBreakout\u003c/a\u003e, but with many subtleties of its own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have full control over the bat, able to move up and down as well as left and right. The latter can be useful as only part of the bottom of the screen actually results in the ball going out of play - a wall protects much of the floor. There are inbuilt trees which can\u0027t be played through, and dynamite sticks which can clear large sections of earthing at a time.","publishedBy":"Methodic Solutions","developedBy":"Methodic Solutions","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Atari ST | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/bank-buster","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Methodic Solutions","developer":"Methodic Solutions","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
