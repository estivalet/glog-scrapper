{"name":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes","description":"\u003ci\u003eDragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes\u003c/i\u003e tells the story of a young prince named Selios. One day his old teacher Raiyas sends him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magic weapon. When the prince returns, he finds the house attacked by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek help in the castle of a baron, whose country has always been allies with theirs for a long time. However, the baron betrays Selios\u0027 trust and imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, but without the possibility to return he has no choice but to wander through the land, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him to save his country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a traditional medieval-themed Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective (like in \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/dragon-warrior\"\u003e Dragon Warrior\u003c/a\u003e games). The enemies are semi-random: they do appear out of nowhere and attack suddenly, but they are visible on the screen, and if you flee from a battle they will still be there to pursue you.","publishedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","released":"1990","alsoFor":"FM Towns, Genesis, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000, SNES, TurboGrafx CD, Wii | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"1st-person, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"4 956027 090585","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120471-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-screenshot-title-screen.gif","/images/shots/l/120468-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-screenshot-intro.gif","/images/shots/l/120469-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-screenshot-on-the-world.gif","/images/shots/l/120470-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-screenshot-in-your.gif","/images/shots/l/120467-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-screenshot-random-battle.gif","/images/shots/l/120472-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-screenshot-it-s-dark.gif","/images/shots/l/120473-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-screenshot-underground.gif"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/382685-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/382686-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327688-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-msx-media.jpg"]}
