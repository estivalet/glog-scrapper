{"name":"Twilight Zone II: Nagisa no Yakata","description":"YÅ?ko, the protagonist\u0027s girlfriend, has disappeared. In order to find her he must venture into the dreaded mansion inhabited by sex-hungry women. Though the game has a similar setting as its \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/twilight-zone_\"\u003epredecessor\u003c/a\u003e, gameplay-wise it is entirely different, being a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG. The environment in the game consists of several floors of identically-looking maze-like pseudo-3D corridors. There is no automapping feature. Enemies would randomly pop up; all of them are young girls, and the protagonist must have sex with them instead of fighting. Different sexual positions correspond to different types of attacks in more conventional role-playing games. Items and most other RPG-related paraphernalia are also expressed through sexual terms. Experience points and currency (which can be spent on items and resting in special locations) are awarded as well.","publishedBy":"Great Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"Great Co., Ltd.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/twilight-zone-ii-nagisa-no-yakata","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Great Co., Ltd.","developer":"Great Co., Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
