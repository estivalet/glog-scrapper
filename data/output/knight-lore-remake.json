The map can be called with the SHIFT key. When used on a MSX Turbo R, the game activates the R800 CPU to prevent slowdowns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay remains the same, where the player must guide the explorer Sabreman through a castle labyrinth, collecting all the ingredients for a potion spell. The daytime cycle occurs every few minutes, turning the main character into a werewolf when the evening starts, and back to human form when the dawn breaks. The remake has a darker, colder palette for night time. The quest must be completed in 40 days, roughly an hour of real time, to win the game and cure Sabreman of lycanthropy.","publishedBy":"RetroWorks","developedBy":"RetroWorks","released":"May 30, 2009","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/knight-lore-remake","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"RetroWorks","developer":"RetroWorks","ported":"","country":" Worldwide","releaseDate":"May 30, 2009","ean13":"","comments":"Download release"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/418362-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/418363-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/418364-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-game-start.png","/images/shots/l/418365-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-werewolf-form.png","/images/shots/l/418366-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-portcullis.png","/images/shots/l/418367-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-moment-of-transformation.png","/images/shots/l/418368-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-map.png","/images/shots/l/418369-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-extra-life.png","/images/shots/l/418370-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-ghost.png","/images/shots/l/418371-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-guarded-passage.png","/images/shots/l/418372-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-guard.png","/images/shots/l/418373-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-moving-platforms.png","/images/shots/l/418374-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-spike-balls.png","/images/shots/l/418375-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-fire-trap.png","/images/shots/l/418376-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-gargoyles.png","/images/shots/l/418377-knight-lore-remake-msx-screenshot-sabreman-jumping-to-a-platform.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/176048-knight-lore-remake-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/176049-knight-lore-remake-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
