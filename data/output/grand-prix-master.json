{"name":"Grand Prix Master","description":"A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez \u0027Aspar\u0027, and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.","publishedBy":"Dinamic Software","developedBy":"Dinamic Software","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Racing / Driving","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/grand-prix-master","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Dinamic Software","developer":"Dinamic Software","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/135007-grand-prix-master-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135008-grand-prix-master-msx-screenshot-menu.png","/images/shots/l/135009-grand-prix-master-msx-screenshot-you-must-use-your-brakes.png","/images/shots/l/135010-grand-prix-master-msx-screenshot-passing-the-finish-line.png","/images/shots/l/135011-grand-prix-master-msx-screenshot-no-curves-so-go-full-speed.png","/images/shots/l/135012-grand-prix-master-msx-screenshot-passed-the-curve.png"],"cover":[]}
