{"name":"Super Boy III","description":"The third entry in Zemina\u0027s unlicensed conversions of early \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dMario\"\u003eSuper Mario Bros.\u003c/a\u003e games differs from its predecessors by having its own levels. While the two first games imported levels of their correspondent Mario counterparts, \u003ci\u003eSuper Boy III\u003c/i\u003e does not copy the stages of \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/super-mario-bros-3\"\u003eSuper Mario Bros 3.\u003c/a\u003e. Instead, it utilizes elements from previous Mario games as well as \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/super-mario-world\"\u003eSuper Mario World\u003c/a\u003e, from where some enemies and level design ingredients are borrowed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike those two games, however, \u003ci\u003eSuper Boy III\u003c/i\u003e  has completely linear levels that must be traversed in a particular order. There are no special levels such as castles, no familiar bonuses, and no power-ups besides those that were introduced in the \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/super-mario-bros\"\u003efirst Mario\u003c/a\u003e game. Mario also walks and runs significantly slower than in Nintendo games. At the end of each stage Mario has to defeat a Hammer Brother.","publishedBy":"Zemina Co.","developedBy":"Zemina Co.","released":"1991","alsoFor":"SEGA Master System | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/super-boy-iii","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Zemina Co.","developer":"Zemina Co.","ported":"","country":" South Korea","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/837261-super-boy-iii-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/837262-super-boy-iii-msx-screenshot-ready-for-round-01.png","/images/shots/l/837263-super-boy-iii-msx-screenshot-where-have-i-seen-this-character.png","/images/shots/l/837264-super-boy-iii-msx-screenshot-jumping-onto-objects.png"],"cover":[]}
