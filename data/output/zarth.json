Near the end of the century, one of such systems, Orion, triggered a devastating nuclear war. A few survivors found a shelter and went into a cryogenic sleep. A hundred years later, they wake up and go out onto the surface, to face a new, unknown world...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eZarth\u003c/i\u003e is a text adventure with graphics. Like many other Japanese games of its type, it supports text interaction as well as commands assigned to function keys (e.g. those used for navigation).
