There are 100 screens to be conquered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life).  Extra lives are also awarded when the player scores 10,000 points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!","publishedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Thomson MO, Thomson TO, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/krakout","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 013658 013167","comments":""},{"publisher":"Kixx","developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","ported":"","country":" France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"5 013442 542736","comments":"Budget re-release"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/135746-krakout-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135747-krakout-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135748-krakout-msx-screenshot-options-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135749-krakout-msx-screenshot-beginning-of-level-1.png","/images/shots/l/135750-krakout-msx-screenshot-hit-those-smiley-like-figures.png","/images/shots/l/135751-krakout-msx-screenshot-try-to-get-the-ball-behind-the-solid.png","/images/shots/l/135752-krakout-msx-screenshot-this-level-is-almost-clear.png","/images/shots/l/135754-krakout-msx-screenshot-a-fresh-new-level.png","/images/shots/l/135755-krakout-msx-screenshot-hit-the-monsters-for-bonuses.png","/images/shots/l/135757-krakout-msx-screenshot-sometimes-a-letter-appears-in-a-block.png","/images/shots/l/135758-krakout-msx-screenshot-hitting-a-block-that-contains-a-letter.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/119039-krakout-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/119040-krakout-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120745-krakout-msx-media.jpg","/images/covers/l/207895-krakout-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/207896-krakout-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/207897-krakout-msx-media.jpg"]}
