{"name":"Super Snake","description":"You maneuver a snake across the screen eating boxed objects that make it\u0027s tail grow. At the the same time you have to avoid obstacles like it\u0027s own tail, monsters and the screen edge. The screen edge will open occasionally and that gives you the opportunity to enter the screen on the opposing side.Question marks may appear on the screen and can be eaten for bonuses. You \u0027ll enter the next round when all objects are cleared.","publishedBy":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","developedBy":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","released":"1983","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED], Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/super-snake","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","developer":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1983","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/133116-super-snake-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/133117-super-snake-msx-screenshot-enter-the-screen-edge-on-the-left.png","/images/shots/l/133118-super-snake-msx-screenshot-monsters.png"],"cover":[]}
