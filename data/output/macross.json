{"name":"Macross","description":"\u003ci\u003eMacross: Countdown\u003c/i\u003e (released outside of Japan as just \u003ci\u003eMacross\u003c/i\u003e) is a side-scrolling shoot\u0027em up based on the classic anime series. Players control a Valkyrie fighter that launches from the Macross to rescue Lynn Minmay from the Zentradi. Many waves of enemies must be overcome by evading or shooting at them. A radar at the bottom of the screen displays incoming enemies and obstacles. As in the series, the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes, but cannot fire any weapons while transforming: in Fighter mode, it is fast and maneuverable. Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie\u0027s projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though.
