{"name":"Tai-Pan","description":"You wish to make your fortune in China, in this adaptation of James Clavell\u0027s book. First job is to get enough of a loan to buy a ship; once you have this, and get a crew either by paying them or simply kidnapping them, you can begin trading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game has three main stages, and a number of different gameplay elements, largely allowing you choose your own path. Initially you walk the streets trying to get the right elements and people, then you head out onto the waters to head to other trading cities. Upon approaching other ships you can board them and do battle with their inhabitants.","publishedBy":"Ocean Software Ltd.","developedBy":"Ocean Software Ltd.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Simulation","perspective":"Side view, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/tai-pan","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","developer":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/137265-tai-pan-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/137266-tai-pan-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/137267-tai-pan-msx-screenshot-the-china-mainland.png","/images/shots/l/137268-tai-pan-msx-screenshot-you-ll-have-to-trade-some-goods-before.png","/images/shots/l/137269-tai-pan-msx-screenshot-buy-stuff-in-a-shop.png","/images/shots/l/137270-tai-pan-msx-screenshot-entering-a-shop.png","/images/shots/l/137271-tai-pan-msx-screenshot-loan-some-money-at-the-bank.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/167083-tai-pan-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/167084-tai-pan-msx-media.jpg"]}
