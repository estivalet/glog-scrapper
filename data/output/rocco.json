{"name":"Rocco","description":"Our Stallone-inspired hero has four fights to win before becoming champion boxer in this sports game. Cimbel Lin, Ted Matare, Jansen Sino and Fighter Bull must be dealt with in order, with fights getting tougher as you progress.The action is viewed in 3D, from behind your boxer and with a full view of your opponent. A health bar is provided for each player, going from green to red as hits are scored. When the strength goes down to zero, a punch will floor your opponent - either player can be seen hitting the floor when a knockout blow is struck. Three knockouts are required to win a fight.","publishedBy":"Dinamic Software","developedBy":"Armid Soft","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Sports","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Boxing","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/rocco","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Dinamic Software","developer":"Armid Soft","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/447090-rocco-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/447091-rocco-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/447092-rocco-msx-screenshot-enter-your-initials.png","/images/shots/l/447093-rocco-msx-screenshot-ding-ding-ding.png","/images/shots/l/447094-rocco-msx-screenshot-oof.png","/images/shots/l/447095-rocco-msx-screenshot-he-knocked-me-out.png","/images/shots/l/447096-rocco-msx-screenshot-i-knocked-him-out.png","/images/shots/l/447097-rocco-msx-screenshot-i-won-prepare-for-the-next-one.png","/images/shots/l/447098-rocco-msx-screenshot-ding-ding-ding.png","/images/shots/l/447099-rocco-msx-screenshot-the-next-fighter.png","/images/shots/l/447100-rocco-msx-screenshot-you-lost.png","/images/shots/l/447101-rocco-msx-screenshot-a-boxing-glove-hits-rocky.png"],"cover":[]}
