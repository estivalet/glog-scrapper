{"name":"SD Snatcher","description":"The year is 2042, the stage is a huge futuristic city Neo Kobe. Among the remains of passengers who died in a plane crash, experts discovered a strange biomechanical organism. Recent events proved that it was not the only appearance of a \u0026quot;snatcher\u0026quot; -a robotic creature who can masterfully disguise itself as a human being in order to infiltrate and to destroy human society. Gillian Seed, a man who suffers from amnesia, remembers just this word: \u0026quot;snatcher\u0026quot;. He joins the Junkers, a combat unit whose goal is to track down and to exterminate the snatchers, and is determined to find out the truth about those creatures and his past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eSD Snatcher\u003c/i\u003e is based on the same story as the more famous \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/snatcher\"\u003e Snatcher\u003c/a\u003e, but gameplay-wise it is an entirely different game: an RPG. You navigate your hero from top-down view, enter buildings and talk to people. In many locations you\u0027ll meet enemies who are visible on the screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a turn-based battle begins. You can choose to fire from a variety of weapons, and to target a specific part of the enemy\u0027s body. Targeting has a direct effect in battles: for example, shooting the enemy\u0027s gun will weaken it, destroying its wheels will prevent it from avoiding your shots to its face or body, etc. You gain experience points (\u0026quot;rank points\u0026quot;), improving in different categories (speed, defense, etc.). You also improve your weapon skills by continuously using the same weapon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike \u003ci\u003eSnatcher\u003c/i\u003e with its \u0026quot;serious\u0026quot; graphics, the characters in \u003ci\u003eSD Snatcher\u003c/i\u003e have a typically Japanese anime \u0026quot;super-deformed\u0026quot; style, which adds an element of a parody to the game.","publishedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"Apr 27, 1990","alsoFor":"","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/sd-snatcher","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Konami Industry Co.
