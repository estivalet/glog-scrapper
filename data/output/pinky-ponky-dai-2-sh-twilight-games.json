{"name":"Pinky Ponky Dai-2 Sh?: Twilight Games","description":"The gameplay system of the second game in the Pinky Ponky series is identical to that of its \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/pinky-ponky-dai-1-sh-beautiful-dream\"\u003epredecessor\u003c/a\u003e: the player character goes through five encounters with young women with the goal of eventually having sex with them. The gameplay consists of selecting dialogue choices and occasional actions, trying to raise the girl\u0027s satisfaction meter and not lead a scenario to a premature end. The situations are somewhat more exotic than in the first game - rather than focusing on conventional dating it depicts less common situations such as appeasing an angry female policeman or protecting a girl from a lecherous passer-by.
