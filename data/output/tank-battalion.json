{"name":"Tank Battalion","description":"In \u003ci\u003eTank Battalion\u003c/i\u003e, you control a tank in a maze. One after another, enemy tanks enter the maze, and you must shoot them all before they reach and destroy your base. The maze walls can be shot and destroyed. After all white tanks are destroyed, you proceed to the next level. Each level layout calls for different tactics, depending on the formations of the walls. Some spots on certain levels make for perfect ambush tactics, on other levels you must rally back and forth to eradicate the enemy tanks. Occasionally a red tank appears, shoot it for bonus points.","publishedBy":"Namco Limited","developedBy":"Namco Limited","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Arcade, Sord M5 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED], Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/tank-battalion","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Namco Limited","developer":"Namco Limited","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Bug-Byte Software Ltd.","developer":"Namco Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"5 013248 001208","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131793-tank-battalion-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131794-tank-battalion-msx-screenshot-attack-the-enemy-tanks.png","/images/shots/l/131795-tank-battalion-msx-screenshot-you-can-also-destroy-the-maze.png","/images/shots/l/131796-tank-battalion-msx-screenshot-no-maze-in-this-level.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/117708-tank-battalion-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117709-tank-battalion-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117707-tank-battalion-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
