The police can find no clues, so it\u0027s time for the private detective \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dJ%2eB%2e+Harold\"\u003e J.B. Harold\u003c/a\u003e to investigate the murder and to bring the killer to justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite its Japanese origins, \u003ci\u003eManhattan Requiem\u003c/i\u003e has realistic graphic design without any manga/anime influences. As an adventure game, it has Japanese influences (no inventory, no puzzles), as well as Western ones (relative freedom in navigation, detailed dialogue system, no \u0026quot;trigger commands\u0026quot; to advance the plot). The game plays similarly to a real investigation: the player has to question suspects, collect evidence, find new leads, after which new locations become accessible. It is also possible to review all the data collected during the investigation in-game, by going to a bar at any time.","publishedBy":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","developedBy":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1, Sharp X68000, Windows | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/jb-harold-series-2-manhattan-requiem-angels-flying-in-the-dark","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","developer":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/548989-j-b-harold-series-2-manhattan-requiem-angels-flying-in-the.png","/images/shots/l/548990-j-b-harold-series-2-manhattan-requiem-angels-flying-in-the.png","/images/shots/l/548991-j-b-harold-series-2-manhattan-requiem-angels-flying-in-the.png","/images/shots/l/548992-j-b-harold-series-2-manhattan-requiem-angels-flying-in-the.png"],"cover":[]}
