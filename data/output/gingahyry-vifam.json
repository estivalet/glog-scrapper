{"name":"Gingahy?ry? Vifam","description":"Based on Nippon Sunrise\u0027s animation series of the eighties, your goal in \u003ci\u003eVifam\u003c/i\u003e is to guide your mothership to a specific planet while surviving the assault of enemy robots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is divided into three screens, or monitors:\u003cbr\u003eMonitor 1 is a two-dimensional starmap, where you guide your ship through the planet system while avoiding being pulled into a planet\u0027s gravity field. If this happens, the game switches to a screen displaying the planet in close-up, and you must immediately accelerate out of its vicinity. The radar screen displays both approaching enemy robots and an arrow pointing to your destination. You have a limited fuel supply, so time must not be wasted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the red dots on your radar come too close, you must switch to monitor 2, where you fly the robot Vifam in a first-person perspective through space in order to shoot the enemy down. After that, you can return to the mother ship and resume your voyage. Monitor 3 is used for servicing Vifam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you\u0027ve reached the red planet, the game wraps around and you must do the same voyage again.","publishedBy":"Bandai Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"","released":"1984","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"1st-person, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/gingahyry-vifam","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Bandai Co., Ltd.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/197792-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/197795-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-the-mother-ship-navigates.png","/images/shots/l/197801-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-trying-to-escape-the-gravity.png","/images/shots/l/197793-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-view-from-vifam-s-cockpit.png","/images/shots/l/197799-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-shoot-down-the-enemy.png","/images/shots/l/197798-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-return-to-mother-ship.png","/images/shots/l/197794-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-the-state-of-vifam.png","/images/shots/l/197800-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-reached-the-red-planet.png","/images/shots/l/197797-gingahyoryu-vifam-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
