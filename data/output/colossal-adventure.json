Our hero must rescue the elves and find fifteen pieces of treasure. There are many dark areas, so lights and batteries are at a premium. Be careful of vicious dwarves, who can be killed using axes. You can carry up to four objects at a time; the useful ones include a newspaper, keys and sandwiches. The vocabulary includes saying spell names, DROPping items to stay within the carrying limit (and for other specific reasons), CATCHing a bird, and standard directions plus IN and OUT.","publishedBy":"Level 9 Computing, Ltd.","developedBy":"Level 9 Computing, Ltd.","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit, BBC Micro, Camputers Lynx, Commodore 64, Enterprise, Memotech MTX, Nascom, Oric, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/colossal-adventure","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Level 9 Computing, Ltd.","developer":"Level 9 Computing, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/839080-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/839081-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-start-of-game.png","/images/shots/l/839082-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-a-river.png","/images/shots/l/839083-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-dried-up-riverbed.png","/images/shots/l/839084-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-narrow-valley.png","/images/shots/l/839085-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-narrow-valley-with-rocks.png","/images/shots/l/839086-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-canyon-below.png","/images/shots/l/839087-colossal-adventure-msx-screenshot-oops-fell-to-my-death.png"],"cover":[]}
