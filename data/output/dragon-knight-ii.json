{"name":"Dragon Knight II","description":"Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don\u0027t count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country\u0027s lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/knights-of-xentar\"\u003eKnights of Xentar\u003c/a\u003e), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be \u003ci\u003every\u003c/i\u003e grateful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eDragon Knight II\u003c/i\u003e is the predecessor to \u003ci\u003eKnights of Xentar\u003c/i\u003e, the only \u003ci\u003eDragon Knight\u003c/i\u003e game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.","publishedBy":"Elf Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"Elf Co., Ltd.","released":"1991","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000, TurboGrafx CD | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dragon-knight-ii","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120354-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-cute-elf-logo.gif","/images/shots/l/120349-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-some-story.gif","/images/shots/l/120350-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-a-nice-view-over-phoenix.gif","/images/shots/l/120351-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-takeru-is-wandering-around.gif","/images/shots/l/120352-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-recognize-the-guy-he-is-actually.gif","/images/shots/l/120353-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-baan-is-upset.gif","/images/shots/l/120348-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-i-didn-t-come-here-to-read.gif","/images/shots/l/120355-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-in-the-town.gif","/images/shots/l/120356-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-come-on-wiseman-spill-out.gif","/images/shots/l/120358-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-character-information.gif","/images/shots/l/120359-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-well-at-least-that-was-clear.gif","/images/shots/l/120360-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-oooooh-baby-shall-we-ahem.gif","/images/shots/l/120361-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-inventory-screen.gif","/images/shots/l/120362-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-the-stubborn-girl-won-t-let.gif","/images/shots/l/120363-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-graveyard.gif","/images/shots/l/120364-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-trying-to-stay-in-the-inn.gif","/images/shots/l/120365-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-buying-weapons-and-armor.gif","/images/shots/l/120366-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-drugstore.gif","/images/shots/l/120367-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-visiting-a-magic-user.gif","/images/shots/l/120368-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-standard-dungeon.gif","/images/shots/l/120369-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-in-front-of-a-door.gif","/images/shots/l/120370-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-tower-entrance.gif","/images/shots/l/120371-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-battle-a-random-enemy-attacks.gif","/images/shots/l/120372-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-the-enemy-becomes-much-cuter.gif","/images/shots/l/120373-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-another-one-of-mesaana-s-demonic.gif","/images/shots/l/120374-dragon-knight-ii-msx-screenshot-sex-instead-of-gore-isn-t.gif"],"cover":[]}
