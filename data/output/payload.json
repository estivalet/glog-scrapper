In this game it\u0027s all about control and management. You can choose your own contracts. You have to deliver your good on time. Any delay will be deducted from your commission. Delivering the goods on time can be quite a challenge.If you overload your truck the police will fine you if they order you to stop. The police will also fine you if you exceed the speed limit or don\u0027t stop at a traffic light when it\u0027s red.The gasoline and truck repairs - in case of an accident - are expensive.","publishedBy":"Sony Corporation","developedBy":"ZAP Corporation","released":"1985","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action, Simulation","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/payload","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sony Corporation","developer":"ZAP Corporation","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/137003-payload-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/137005-payload-msx-screenshot-all-freight-information-you-need-to.png","/images/shots/l/137006-payload-msx-screenshot-the-some-info-but-in-japanese.png","/images/shots/l/137007-payload-msx-screenshot-loading-your-truck.png","/images/shots/l/137008-payload-msx-screenshot-see-the-status-bar-for-information.png","/images/shots/l/137009-payload-msx-screenshot-stop-at-the-traffic-light-if-you-don.png","/images/shots/l/137010-payload-msx-screenshot-accidents-and-gasoline-are-expensive.png","/images/shots/l/137012-payload-msx-screenshot-another-red-light-near-your-destination.png","/images/shots/l/137013-payload-msx-screenshot-accident-report.png"],"cover":[]}
