{"name":"Trigger","description":"Crazy Park is a place not recommended for people who want to have a peaceful existence, because the murderers, thieves and other thugs converted it in their home. But of course, as in every other story where some bad guys take a place which doesn\u0027t belong to them, there will appear a guy ready to end with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eTrigger\u003c/i\u003e is a first-person view game where you have to make use of your Gun Stick accessory. The game has a side scroll by which you will see a multitude of enemies emerging. Some of them will shot at you, others will launch grenades, knives... there will even be exhibitionists. But don\u0027t go too fast, there will be other persons to which you should not shot at, otherwise points would be reduced from your marker. Also, there will also appear some objects that will recharge your ammunition.","publishedBy":"Opera Soft S.A.","developedBy":"Opera Soft S.A.","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"1st-person, Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/trigger","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Opera Soft S.A.","developer":"Opera Soft S.A.","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/298766-trigger-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/298767-trigger-msx-screenshot-high-score.png","/images/shots/l/298768-trigger-msx-screenshot-game-start.png","/images/shots/l/298769-trigger-msx-screenshot-enemies-all-over-the-screen.png","/images/shots/l/298770-trigger-msx-screenshot-enemies-throwing-things-at-the-player.png","/images/shots/l/298771-trigger-msx-screenshot-enemies-on-a-swing.png"],"cover":[]}
