{"name":"Computer Scrabble","description":"\u003ci\u003eComputer Scrabble\u003c/i\u003e is the earliest official computer version of the popular word game. The game has a 8500-20000 word dictionary depending on the computer, containing the most frequently-used words in Scrabble. As a result, some very obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 letters - keen Scrabble players will know that these are often the most profitable scoring method) are included, but common words such as \u0027bigot\u0027 and \u0027sheen\u0027 are queried by the game - simply tell it that your move is a word and it will move on trustingly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInputting words is done by moving the cursor across or down to the starting position of the word, and then pressing to key the word in, pressing space before the letter you wish to use a blank tile as. All words formed are accurately scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow you to manually rearrange them, and you can watch the computer \u0027think\u0027 as it notices possible moves and their scoring. There are four difficulty levels, with the highest capable of combined scores over 700.","publishedBy":"Leisure Genius","developedBy":"Psion Software Ltd.","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, Commodore 64, DOS, Sinclair QL, Tatung Einstein, Thomson MO, Thomson TO, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/computer-scrabble","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Leisure Genius","developer":"Psion Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/141238-computer-scrabble-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/141239-computer-scrabble-msx-screenshot-do-you-want-to-see-the-computer.png","/images/shots/l/141240-computer-scrabble-msx-screenshot-the-first-player-has-to-form.png","/images/shots/l/141241-computer-scrabble-msx-screenshot-the-second-player-should.png","/images/shots/l/141242-computer-scrabble-msx-screenshot-it-s-player-one-s-turn-again.png","/images/shots/l/141243-computer-scrabble-msx-screenshot-a-few-turns-later.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/120104-computer-scrabble-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120611-computer-scrabble-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120612-computer-scrabble-msx-media.jpg"]}
