{"name":"Crazy Golf","description":"Nine holes of chaotic top-viewed ricochets and hazards make up this early \u003ci\u003eCrazy Golf\u003c/i\u003e game. They can be skipped for a score of 12 if you get stuck. There are no moving hazards, so gameplay is essentially a golf-themed precise positioning puzzle. Furthering this aspect, it does not matter what pace the ball is at when it reaches the hole (it never rebounds out of it) and that rebounds are always at precise 90-degree angles without taking pace out of the ball.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSixteen shot angles and sixteen shot paces are available. The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through. The final hole combines all these for a par-12 challenge.","publishedBy":"Mr. Micro Ltd.","developedBy":"Mr. Micro Ltd.","released":"1983","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16, Plus/4, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Sports","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Golf","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/crazy-golf","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Mr. Micro Ltd.","developer":"Mr. Micro Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1983","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/838317-crazy-golf-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/838318-crazy-golf-msx-screenshot-do-you-need-instructions.png","/images/shots/l/838319-crazy-golf-msx-screenshot-help-1-2.png","/images/shots/l/838320-crazy-golf-msx-screenshot-help-2-2.png","/images/shots/l/838321-crazy-golf-msx-screenshot-gameplay.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/169891-crazy-golf-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169890-crazy-golf-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169892-crazy-golf-msx-media.jpg"]}
