{"name":"Desolator","description":"Desolator is best described as \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dDefender\"\u003eDefender\u003c/a\u003e without the little men. What is still there is the fast horizontally scrolling landscape, the green aliens (also known as the Gargoans), the radar and, to a certain extent, the rescue objectives. For lack of humans to rescue, you must instead capture the \u0026quot;Energiser\u0026quot;; an object which certain enemies will try to steal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game has, just like other Defender-like games, several types of enemies, from the rather dumb basic aliens, to stationary objects with high firepower, and quick hunters which might crash into you. Each level has a specific objective, though it is usually finished by killing everything that moves. As a last-ditch effort, you can activate the \u0026quot;desolator\u0026quot;, which is a fancy name for a smart bomb device, killing everything on-screen.","publishedBy":"Erbe Software, S.A.","developedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/desolator","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 013658 013075","comments":""},{"publisher":"Erbe Software, S.A.","developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/214930-desolator-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/214931-desolator-msx-screenshot-collect-the-energiser.png","/images/shots/l/214932-desolator-msx-screenshot-lots-of-aliens-here.png","/images/shots/l/214934-desolator-msx-screenshot-eat-photon-death.png","/images/shots/l/214941-desolator-msx-screenshot-the-energiser.png","/images/shots/l/214935-desolator-msx-screenshot-beware-the-bombarder.png","/images/shots/l/214942-desolator-msx-screenshot-the-bombarder.png","/images/shots/l/214936-desolator-msx-screenshot-lovely-explosion.png","/images/shots/l/214938-desolator-msx-screenshot-wave-3.png","/images/shots/l/214943-desolator-msx-screenshot-the-minkys.png","/images/shots/l/214939-desolator-msx-screenshot-a-reasonable-score.png","/images/shots/l/214940-desolator-msx-screenshot-mega-desolators.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/143697-desolator-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/143696-desolator-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/143698-desolator-msx-media.jpg"]}
