{"name":"K?nai Shasei 1: Yo ni mo H na Monogatari","description":"\u003ci\u003eKÅ?nai Shasei\u003c/i\u003e opens with a text introduction that describes a miraculous Girls\u0027 High School that can be accessed by sailing through the Indian Ocean or walking along the Silk Road - a school that even the famous Marco Polo allegedly describes in his memoirs. This establishes the humorous tone of subsequent narrative, which has little to do with history and a lot to do with pretty high school girls. The game has no real story, being instead composed of five unrelated vignettes, short episodes that feature a sexy high school girl, a male protagonist (named \u0026quot;God\u0026quot; by default), and various comical and erotic situations under different circumstances: meeting in a school, haunted house, crowded train station, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay walks the middle ground between a \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; Japanese-style adventure and a visual novel. There are verb commands and sometimes also vast sub-menus with objects that allow text-based interaction; however, many segments are very straightforward and only involve occasional choice-making. There are also a few mini-games, such as a quiz, which must be solved by the player in order to avoid a premature Game Over.","publishedBy":"FairyTale","developedBy":"FairyTale","released":"Sep 13, 1991","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/knai-shasei-1-yo-ni-mo-h-na-monogatari","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"FairyTale","developer":"FairyTale","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Sep 13, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
