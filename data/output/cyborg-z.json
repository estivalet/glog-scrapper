One or two players control identically-looking giant robots reminiscent of \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dMazinger+Z\"\u003eMazinger Z\u003c/a\u003e, moving in all directions and shooting at enemies as the screen slowly scrolls forward. The game\u0027s visual design and gameplay are very similar to those of Zemina\u0027s own \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/three-dragon-story\"\u003eThe Three Dragon Story\u003c/a\u003e. Weapon power-ups are stored in boxes that must be destroyed to acquire them. The robot starts with a close-range punch attack; additional weapons include laser gun, energy bullets, rockets, and others. Players can switch between the weapons at any time. There are eight levels in total in the game, each culminating with a boss battle.","publishedBy":"Zemina Co.","developedBy":"Zemina Co.","released":"Aug, 1991","alsoFor":"SEGA Master System | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/cyborg-z","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Zemina Co.","developer":"Zemina Co.","ported":"","country":" South Korea","releaseDate":"Aug, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
