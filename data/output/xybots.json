{"name":"Xybots","description":"\u003ci\u003eXybots\u003c/i\u003e is a sci-fi shooter with pseudo-3D environments explored from a third-person perspective. The game can be played by one or two players; the two-player mode takes place on a split screen. The hero(es) must move through a series of \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dGauntlet\"\u003eGauntlet\u003c/a\u003e-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers. It\u0027s designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Xybots are out to stop the protagonists, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at them. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing the player to plan a strategy - often it\u0027s good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, similarly to the tactics often employed in \u003ci\u003eGauntlet\u003c/i\u003e.","publishedBy":"Domark Ltd.","developedBy":"Tengen Inc.","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Lynx, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Behind view, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/xybots","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Domark Ltd.","developer":"Tengen Inc.","ported":"Teque Software Development Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/133216-xybots-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/133217-xybots-msx-screenshot-start-player-1.png","/images/shots/l/133218-xybots-msx-screenshot-aliens.png","/images/shots/l/133219-xybots-msx-screenshot-game-over.png","/images/shots/l/445661-xybots-msx-screenshot-playing-the-game-with-2-players.png"],"cover":[]}
