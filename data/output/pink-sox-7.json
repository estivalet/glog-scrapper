{"name":"Pink Sox 7","description":"\u003ci\u003ePink Sox 7\u003c/i\u003e is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It contains another very short episode in the \u003ci\u003eHalftime Lover\u003c/i\u003e series; like in the few previous installments, it is non-interactive. Otherwise all the mini-games in this volume are new. A mini-adventure entitled \u003ci\u003eG Gun-Cannon\u003c/i\u003e introduces characters seen in other Pink Sox mini-games before (such as Sayaka from \u003ci\u003eBalancing Beam of Love\u003c/i\u003e), and is mostly dedicated to lesbian sex between high school girls. Another very simple Japanese-style adventure is an erotic variation on the Red Riding Hood tale. Finally, there is also a simple slot machine mini-game.","publishedBy":"Wendy Magazine","developedBy":"Wendy Magazine","released":"Oct 04, 1991","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Compilation","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pink-sox-7","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Wendy Magazine","developer":"Wendy Magazine","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Oct 04, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
