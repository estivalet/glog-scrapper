{"name":"Dragon Knight","description":"Strawberry Fields was once a peaceful land. Ruled by the lovely queen Luna and populated only by women, the country knew no trouble. The Goddess Tower protected the inhabitants of Strawberry Fields. But recently, something happened in the tower. It is said that a dragon descended upon it, spawning an army of dragon knights who were threatening the peaceful land. The queen Luna summons you, a wandering adventurer, to descend into the depth of the Goddess Tower and to purge the evil from the land.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eDragon Knight\u003c/i\u003e marked the beginning of Elf\u0027s erotic RPG series. The game is played entirely from a first-person perspective. In the town, you move around by selecting destinations from a menu. Once you enter the tower, you navigate your character through 3D mazes, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. Enemies in the game are scantily clad, attractive young women; there are also several scenes with explicit nudity.","publishedBy":"Elf Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"Elf Co., Ltd.","released":"1989","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dragon-knight","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120347-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-cute-elf-logo.gif","/images/shots/l/120334-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-title-screen.gif","/images/shots/l/120335-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-the-adventurer-observes-strawberry.gif","/images/shots/l/120337-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-intro-talking-to-queen-luna.gif","/images/shots/l/120338-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-town-menu.gif","/images/shots/l/120339-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-entering-the-tower.gif","/images/shots/l/120340-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-buying-weapons-and-armor.gif","/images/shots/l/120341-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-pray-for-me-baby.gif","/images/shots/l/120342-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-palace-entrance.gif","/images/shots/l/120343-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-what-a-sweet-country-this-is.gif","/images/shots/l/120344-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-don-t-hate-me-cause-i-m-beautiful.gif","/images/shots/l/120345-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-battles-have-little-to-offer.gif","/images/shots/l/120346-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-this-demon-is-too-strong.gif","/images/shots/l/120333-dragon-knight-msx-screenshot-rest-in-peace-brave-warrior.gif"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/80296-dragon-knight-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/80297-dragon-knight-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
