Also, enemies become progressively harder as the controlled aircraft collects power-ups.","publishedBy":"Namco Limited","developedBy":"Namco Limited","released":"Dec 23, 1988","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED], Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/xevious-fardraut-saga","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Namco Limited","developer":"Namco Limited","ported":"Compile","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Dec 23, 1988","ean13":"4 907892 030152","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/135223-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-namco-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135224-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/135225-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-scramble-jet.png","/images/shots/l/135226-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-your-mission.png","/images/shots/l/135227-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-known-object.png","/images/shots/l/135228-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-identified-object.png","/images/shots/l/135229-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-another-object.png","/images/shots/l/135230-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-underground-objects-not.png","/images/shots/l/135231-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-solvalou.png","/images/shots/l/135232-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-zeodalley.png","/images/shots/l/135233-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-solgrado.png","/images/shots/l/135234-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-gampmission.png","/images/shots/l/135235-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-the-start-of-thte-second.png","/images/shots/l/135236-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-a-fast-moving-formation.png","/images/shots/l/135237-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-rotation-objects.png","/images/shots/l/135238-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-the-area-boss-at-the.png","/images/shots/l/135239-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-screenshot-another-structure-to.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/80260-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/80261-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/226359-xevious-fardraut-saga-msx-media.jpg"]}
