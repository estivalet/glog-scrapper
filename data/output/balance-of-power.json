{"name":"Balance of Power","description":"The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world\u0027s most powerful and prestigious over the course of your eight years in office. Sounds easy, doesn\u0027t it? It would be if the other guy didn\u0027t have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up third world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction. The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  ","publishedBy":"ASCII Corporation","developedBy":"","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, DOS, Macintosh, PC-88, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Simulation, Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/balance-of-power","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"ASCII Corporation","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/214169-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-the-ominous-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/214170-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-this-is-a-game-of-geopolitics.png","/images/shots/l/214171-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-choose-side-and-difficulty.png","/images/shots/l/214173-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-there-is-a-revolution-in-burma.png","/images/shots/l/214174-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-the-soviet-and-american-spheres.png","/images/shots/l/214175-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-the-distribution-of-military.png","/images/shots/l/214176-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-soviet-diplomatic-relations.png","/images/shots/l/214177-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-diplomatic-rap-sheet-for-sweden.png","/images/shots/l/214178-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-an-extract-from-the-burma.png","/images/shots/l/214179-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-the-revolution-is-spreading.png","/images/shots/l/214180-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-going-up-to-defcon-4.png","/images/shots/l/214181-balance-of-power-msx-screenshot-in-war-there-are-no-winners.png"],"cover":[]}
