{"name":"Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II","description":"Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eXanadu: Dragon Slayer II\u003c/i\u003e bears many similarities to the \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/dragon-slayer\"\u003efirst Dragon Slayer\u003c/a\u003e, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in \u003ci\u003eXanadu\u003c/i\u003e is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply \u0026quot;bumping\u0026quot; into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExperience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a \u0026quot;karma\u0026quot; system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many \u0026quot;good\u0026quot; enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","publishedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developedBy":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-8000, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined View","genre":"Action, Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Side view, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/120421-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-title-screen.gif","/images/shots/l/120414-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-the-king-gives-you.gif","/images/shots/l/120415-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-inventory-screen.gif","/images/shots/l/120416-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-training-strength.gif","/images/shots/l/120417-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-training-intelligence.gif","/images/shots/l/120418-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-is-this-guy-buddhist.gif","/images/shots/l/120419-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-dexterity-is-the-key.gif","/images/shots/l/120420-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-agility-is-what-you.gif","/images/shots/l/120413-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-want-to-be-more-charismatic.gif","/images/shots/l/120422-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-learning-magic-power.gif","/images/shots/l/120423-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-falling-down-falling.gif","/images/shots/l/120424-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-hmm-how-do-i-get-there.gif","/images/shots/l/120425-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-the-cave-leads-to-where.gif","/images/shots/l/120426-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-hey-baby-what-s-your.gif","/images/shots/l/120427-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-fighting-a-lone-slime.gif","/images/shots/l/120428-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-food-is-also-important.gif","/images/shots/l/120429-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-resting-in-an-inn.gif","/images/shots/l/120430-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-shop-in-the-middle.gif","/images/shots/l/120431-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-treasure-chest-how.gif","/images/shots/l/120432-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-fighting-some-bats.gif","/images/shots/l/120433-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-skeletons-just-what.gif","/images/shots/l/120434-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-the-path-to-tower-is.gif","/images/shots/l/120435-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-xanadu-snake-eater.gif","/images/shots/l/120436-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-screenshot-fire-elementals-guard.gif"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/80206-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/80207-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/209061-xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii-msx-media.jpg"]}
