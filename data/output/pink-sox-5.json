{"name":"Pink Sox 5","description":"\u003ci\u003ePink Sox 5\u003c/i\u003e is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi adventure \u003ci\u003eWho Is There\u003c/i\u003e, its story advancing towards darker themes, as well as a very short non-interactive episode of \u003ci\u003eHalftime Lover\u003c/i\u003e.  The mini-adventure \u003ci\u003eBalancing Beam of Love\u003c/i\u003e, depicting the sexual experiences of a school girl, continues in a slightly different format with a point-and-click interface.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other mini-games are different from those included in the previous volumes. They are: a simple action game entitled \u003ci\u003eMonkey-Mankey-Baby\u003c/i\u003e (\u003ci\u003esic\u003c/i\u003e), in which the player controls a monkey and must imitate the movements of a comical human character by pressing different keys; a simple (no betting) poker game where getting better combinations removes lines obscuring an erotic picture; and a board game named \u003ci\u003eAdultic Time\u003c/i\u003e, in which the player has to position fitting items on a board to match a character (e.g. a GameBoy for a school boy) to defeat an AI-controlled opponent who is trying to do the same.","publishedBy":"Wendy Magazine","developedBy":"Wendy Magazine","released":"Apr 16, 1991","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Compilation","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pink-sox-5","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Wendy Magazine","developer":"Wendy Magazine","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Apr 16, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
