{"name":"Pink Sox 6","description":"\u003ci\u003ePink Sox 6\u003c/i\u003e is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the conclusion of the sci-fi adventure \u003ci\u003eWho Is There\u003c/i\u003e from the previous games, as well as a new chapter in the \u003ci\u003eBalancing Beam of Love\u003c/i\u003e, introducing a new heroine in a superhero comic book-like setting. There are two new mini-games: the first, entitled \u003ci\u003ePC City\u003c/i\u003e, consists of a floating island and a few scenes (mostly involving young women) that occur when the player accesses various locations on it (such as a ship, an observatory, a medieval castle, etc.). The second mini-game is sub-titled \u003ci\u003eLet\u0027s Zazen\u003c/i\u003e and depicts a comical Zen lesson as the player switches between pupils trying to avoid the master\u0027s blows.","publishedBy":"Wendy Magazine","developedBy":"Wendy Magazine","released":"Jul 06, 1991","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Compilation","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pink-sox-6","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Wendy Magazine","developer":"Wendy Magazine","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Jul 06, 1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
