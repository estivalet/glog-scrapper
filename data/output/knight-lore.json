{"name":"Knight Lore","description":"Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?company\u003dUltimate+-+Play+the+Game\"\u003eUltimate\u003c/a\u003e titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/amiga/head-over-heels\"\u003eHead Over Heels\u003c/a\u003e, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate\u0027s individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.","publishedBy":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developedBy":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, NES, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Bird\u0027s-eye view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/knight-lore","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Ultimate - Play the Game","developer":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":"Cassette"},{"publisher":"Dro Soft","developer":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":"Cassette"},{"publisher":"Nippon Dexter Co., Ltd.","developer":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":"Cartridge"},{"publisher":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developer":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","ported":"","country":" The Netherlands","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":"Cassette"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/132825-knight-lore-msx-screenshot-key-select-screen.png","/images/shots/l/132826-knight-lore-msx-screenshot-level-1.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/178642-knight-lore-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/178643-knight-lore-msx-media.jpg","/images/covers/l/397500-knight-lore-msx-front-cover.png","/images/covers/l/397503-knight-lore-msx-inside-cover.png","/images/covers/l/397502-knight-lore-msx-back-cover.png","/images/covers/l/397499-knight-lore-msx-spine-sides.png","/images/covers/l/397501-knight-lore-msx-media.png","/images/covers/l/397504-knight-lore-msx-manual.jpg"]}
