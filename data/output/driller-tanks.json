{"name":"Driller Tanks","description":"Driller Tanks features a side-on view of the tank you control, which is submerged in a maze full of nasties known as Mammuts and Skorks. The aim is to first shoot them, then run them over, within a limited period of time before they wake up and reactivate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou must walk through a particular section of maze to make it accessible for this, as any shot fired into the initial blue barriers will have no effect. At all times you must watch to ensure that none of the Mammuts reach the palace by travelling to the top of the screen. The Skorks are less harmful, but contact with them in their unfrozen state is still fatal, and they refill areas you have cleared.","publishedBy":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","developedBy":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","released":"1983","alsoFor":"ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/driller-tanks","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1983","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Hudson Soft Ltd.","developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/123111-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-driller-tanks-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/123112-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-demo-lesson-chapter-1.png","/images/shots/l/123113-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-demo-lesson-chapter-2-how-to.png","/images/shots/l/123114-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-starting-level-1-how-many-levels.png","/images/shots/l/123115-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-a-mammut-got-frozen-and-overrun.png","/images/shots/l/123116-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-watch-out-for-those-skorks.png","/images/shots/l/123117-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-oops-got-incinerated.png","/images/shots/l/123118-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-a-mammut-is-attacking-the-palace.png","/images/shots/l/123119-driller-tanks-msx-screenshot-well-there-goes-the-palace.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/117448-driller-tanks-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117447-driller-tanks-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169854-driller-tanks-msx-media.jpg"]}
