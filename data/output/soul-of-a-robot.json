{"name":"Soul of a Robot","description":"To save planet Nonterraqueous from a malfunctioning evil computer, its people have built a robot to attack the super-computer. Cunningly, it was designed with such tortured feelings that it can only be happy in successful death, so you must take it to the computer to blow itself up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is a succession of 256 platform-based screens, each of which has many obstacles and hazards. There are 5 levels of jump intensity, and the correct one must be used to clear each hazard and reach the next jump. The maze is split into 3 sections, with the computer in the last of these, and these can only be reached via a teleport.","publishedBy":"Mastertronic Ltd.","developedBy":"Action Byte","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/soul-of-a-robot","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Mastertronic Ltd.","developer":"Action Byte","ported":"Syntaxsoft Ltd","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012967 700607","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/158127-soul-of-a-robot-msx-screenshot-title-screen-options-credits.gif","/images/shots/l/158128-soul-of-a-robot-msx-screenshot-starting-location.gif","/images/shots/l/158129-soul-of-a-robot-msx-screenshot-exploring.gif","/images/shots/l/158130-soul-of-a-robot-msx-screenshot-memo-to-me-don-t-touch-that.gif","/images/shots/l/158131-soul-of-a-robot-msx-screenshot-still-exploring.gif","/images/shots/l/158132-soul-of-a-robot-msx-screenshot-must-find-that-computer.gif"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118688-soul-of-a-robot-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118689-soul-of-a-robot-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118687-soul-of-a-robot-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120690-soul-of-a-robot-msx-media.jpg"]}
