{"name":"Gonzzalezz","description":"Gonzzalezz is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. The main protagonist is a Mexican stereotype (complete with sombrero and huge mustache), that has an obsession with the traditional \u003ci\u003esiesta\u003c/i\u003e. The game is divided in two loads:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eâ?? In the first one, Gonzalez must escape his own nightmare. He moves by executing precise jumps in one big level divided in seven sections, a surreal landscape littered with dangerous objects like flying vacuum-cleaners, disembodied hands, etc. The \u003cb\u003eQ\u003c/b\u003e key is the jump button, while the \u003cb\u003eO\u003c/b\u003e and \u003cb\u003eP\u003c/b\u003e move him left and right respectively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e â?? In the second load, Gonzalez must find his hammock while avoiding the dangers of a stereotypical Mexican landscape (Indian tribes, wild animals, etc). Weapons and ammunition are scattered in one large level divided in sections. He can collect or drop these by crouching with the \u003cb\u003eA\u003c/b\u003e key and can use them with the \u003cb\u003eSPACE\u003c/b\u003e bar.","publishedBy":"Opera Soft S.A.","developedBy":"Opera Soft S.A.","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED], Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/gonzzalezz","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Opera Soft S.A.","developer":"Opera Soft S.A.","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/225700-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/225701-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-intructions.png","/images/shots/l/225702-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-game-start.png","/images/shots/l/225703-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-pipes-and-an-electric.png","/images/shots/l/225704-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-firt-load-vacuum-cleaner.png","/images/shots/l/225705-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-shark.png","/images/shots/l/225706-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-spotlight.png","/images/shots/l/225707-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-egg-and-hunter.png","/images/shots/l/225708-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-car.png","/images/shots/l/225709-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-giant-hand.png","/images/shots/l/225710-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-first-load-grabbed-by-giant-hand.png","/images/shots/l/225711-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-second-load-map.png","/images/shots/l/225712-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-second-load-start.png","/images/shots/l/225713-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-second-load-indian-tribe.png","/images/shots/l/225714-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-second-load-wanted-poster.png","/images/shots/l/225715-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-second-load-dog-and-frog.png","/images/shots/l/225716-gonzzalezz-msx-screenshot-second-load-death.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/327727-gonzzalezz-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327726-gonzzalezz-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327725-gonzzalezz-msx-media.jpg"]}
