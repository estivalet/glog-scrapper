{"name":"Match Day II","description":"The original \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/match-day\"\u003eMatch Day\u003c/a\u003e was the first serious football game to hit the Spectrum, and this sequel emerged over 2 years later. League and Cup tournaments for up to 8 teams (any or all of which can be human-controlled) are offered alongside one-off Friendly matches with a handicap option - passcodes are given to allow you to restore these to the same state another day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMatches are seven-a-side, with variable lengths from 10 to 30 minutes. All kicks except set pieces are variable in strength using a Kick-o-meter which is displayed on screen. One revolutionary feature of the game was the Diamond Deflection System, which mathematically calculated the angle and pace of any rebounds.","publishedBy":"Erbe Software, S.A.","developedBy":"Ocean Software Ltd.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Simulation, Sports","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Football (European) / Soccer","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/match-day-ii","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Erbe Software, S.A.","developer":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","developer":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ported":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","ean13":"5 013156 011054","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/124936-match-day-ii-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/124937-match-day-ii-msx-screenshot-the-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/124938-match-day-ii-msx-screenshot-beginning-a-match.png","/images/shots/l/124939-match-day-ii-msx-screenshot-chasing-the-ball-on-my-opponents.png","/images/shots/l/124940-match-day-ii-msx-screenshot-defending-the-goal.png","/images/shots/l/124941-match-day-ii-msx-screenshot-throwing-the-ball-back-into-play.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/177150-match-day-ii-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/177149-match-day-ii-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/177151-match-day-ii-msx-media.jpg"]}
