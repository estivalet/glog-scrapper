{"name":"ThunderBlade","description":"Aboard the lethal Gunship Gladiator helicopter, it is your job to ensure that a coup fails to install a dictator as leader. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all you\u0027ll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.","publishedBy":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","developedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Arcade, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, Nintendo 3DS, SEGA Master System, Sharp X68000, TurboGrafx-16, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Behind view, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/thunderblade","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","ported":"Tiertex Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/200338-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/200330-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/200336-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-shot-down-on-the-ground.png","/images/shots/l/200337-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-flying-high-into-the-air.png","/images/shots/l/200331-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-level-2-flying-over-a-carrier.png","/images/shots/l/200332-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-bombing-the-sealed-turrets.png","/images/shots/l/200333-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-lots-of-explosions.png","/images/shots/l/200334-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-crashing-into-the-sea.png","/images/shots/l/200335-thunderblade-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/167088-thunderblade-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/167089-thunderblade-msx-media.jpg"]}
