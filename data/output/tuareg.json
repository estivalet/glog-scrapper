{"name":"Tuareg","description":"Life has never been too quiet in Marrakesh, but lately things have been getting harder.  Ait-Amar, the daughter of the sultan, has been kidnapped by a group of Berbers and they are forcing him to give half of his fortune within three days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as you know, with every kidnapping of a princess there\u0027s always an hero ready to rescue her, and Ben-Yussef, our protagonist, has been the chosen one this time to get into the labyrinthine and dangerous Kasbah in order to affront the kidnappers and rescue the handsome daughter of the Sultan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs expected, it will be a hard task, because although there are some local residents willing to give clues in exchange for some coins, others will try to steal everything they can. Besides these two types of Moors, deep in the Kasbah there are women to which you can steal their money, policemen that will take your weapons, and thugs who are at the doors of the houses that you must enter in order to find the princess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike any human being, Ben-Yussef must replenish his strength in inns and restaurants and rest in hotels or hostels, implying a significant economic outlay. You can also buy new weapons in the armouries prepared to this effect, bearing in mind that depending on the neighborhood, these elements may also vary in price.","publishedBy":"Topo Soft","developedBy":"Topo Soft","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Adventure","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/tuareg","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Topo Soft","developer":"Topo Soft","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/451655-tuareg-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/451656-tuareg-msx-screenshot-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/451657-tuareg-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/451658-tuareg-msx-screenshot-a-business-but-i-can-t-get-in.png","/images/shots/l/451659-tuareg-msx-screenshot-that-man-guards-that-doorway-and-won.png","/images/shots/l/451660-tuareg-msx-screenshot-someone-waits-in-a-window.png","/images/shots/l/451661-tuareg-msx-screenshot-he-throws-down-pots-to-try-to-hit-me.png","/images/shots/l/451662-tuareg-msx-screenshot-i-must-have-done-something-wrong-there.png","/images/shots/l/451663-tuareg-msx-screenshot-a-nice-doorway-but-he-won-t-let-me-in.png","/images/shots/l/451664-tuareg-msx-screenshot-trying-to-talk-to-someone.png","/images/shots/l/451665-tuareg-msx-screenshot-in-a-restaurant-i-wonder-what-s-on-the.png"],"cover":[]}
