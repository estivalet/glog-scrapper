{"name":"Panzer Attack","description":"\u003ci\u003ePanzer Attack\u003c/i\u003e is a computerised wargame similar to the board-game Risk, representing World War II\u0027s crucial Battle of the Bulge. The player represents General Hodges, a commander of the US forces, while the computer always plays the German side. The gameplay is turn-based - you move all your tanks using map references, then the computer does the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have to try to protect your fuel dumps against the Germans. The difficulty can be determined by setting how many German divisions are attacking - the default is 200. Intelligence advice you receive is not always accurate, so pay attention to what you can see on the map.","publishedBy":"M.C. Lothlorien Ltd","developedBy":"M.C. Lothlorien Ltd","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Tatung Einstein, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/panzer-attack","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"M.C.
