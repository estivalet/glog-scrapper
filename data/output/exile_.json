A spy of the Crusaders has been spotted outside of the village; following his trail, Sadler encounters the powerful leader of the Knights Templar. Travelling together to different countries of the world, they try to find a mysterious holy artifact that can supposedly put an end to the religious wars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eExile\u003c/i\u003e is a sequel to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/xzr\"\u003eXZR\u003c/a\u003e. Like its predecessor, it is an action role-playing game with platforming elements, set in a fictionalized version of the Middle East and other world regions in 13th century. Travel and exploration occur in the traditional overhead view of RPGs, while the battles and dungeons are side-scrolling mazes, similar to \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dYs+III%3a+Wanderers+from+Ys\"\u003eWanderers from Ys\u003c/a\u003e.

Weapons, armor and items can be bought and sold in towns.","publishedBy":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"Renovation Game","released":"Dec, 1988","alsoFor":"Genesis, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1, TurboGrafx CD | Combined View","genre":"Action, Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Side view, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/exile_","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","developer":"Renovation Game","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Dec, 1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/210434-exile-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/210435-exile-msx-screenshot-sadler-the-protagonist.png","/images/shots/l/210437-exile-msx-screenshot-the-rest-of-the-party.png","/images/shots/l/210439-exile-msx-screenshot-hugues-du-paynes-crusader-and-templar.png","/images/shots/l/210440-exile-msx-screenshot-the-main-party-screen.png","/images/shots/l/210441-exile-msx-screenshot-choose-where-to-travel-on-the-map.png","/images/shots/l/210442-exile-msx-screenshot-ye-olde-weapons-shoppe.png","/images/shots/l/210443-exile-msx-screenshot-the-priest-in-the-mosque-tells-you-to.png","/images/shots/l/210444-exile-msx-screenshot-lurmy-feels-that-something-is-wrong.png","/images/shots/l/210445-exile-msx-screenshot-the-ground-swallows-you-and-you-find.png","/images/shots/l/210447-exile-msx-screenshot-sadler-is-dead.png","/images/shots/l/210448-exile-msx-screenshot-visiting-a-dionysian-temple.png","/images/shots/l/210449-exile-msx-screenshot-inside-the-temple.png","/images/shots/l/210450-exile-msx-screenshot-hey-wanna-buy-some-stuff-man.png","/images/shots/l/210451-exile-msx-screenshot-you-cannot-enter-the-inner-sanctum-of.png","/images/shots/l/210452-exile-msx-screenshot-you-find-your-friend-fakhyle-held-prisoner.png","/images/shots/l/210454-exile-msx-screenshot-is-he-a-friend-or-a-foe.png","/images/shots/l/210455-exile-msx-screenshot-well-at-least-we-are-two-now.png","/images/shots/l/210456-exile-msx-screenshot-at-the-lyceon.png","/images/shots/l/210457-exile-msx-screenshot-pythagoras-reminisces-about-his-journeys.png"],"cover":[]}
