The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard\u0027s system. Three skill levels are provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.","publishedBy":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","developedBy":"Access Software, Inc.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Sports","perspective":"Behind view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Bowling","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/10th-frame","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","developer":"Access Software, Inc.","ported":"Paragon Programming Ltd","country":" France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 013442 538944","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131365-10th-frame-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131366-10th-frame-msx-screenshot-title-and-selection-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131367-10th-frame-msx-screenshot-bowling.png","/images/shots/l/131368-10th-frame-msx-screenshot-no-strike.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118606-10th-frame-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118605-10th-frame-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/168731-10th-frame-msx-media.jpg","/images/covers/l/190117-10th-frame-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/190118-10th-frame-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/190119-10th-frame-msx-media.jpg"]}
