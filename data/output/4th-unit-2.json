Blon-Win is arrested by WWWF and must find a way to contact her friends, escape, and defeat the treacherous organization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sequel follows the same gameplay format, being a predominantly puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure with an interface that combines menu-based verb selection and interaction with objects and characters highlighted on-screen.

Rarely used options such as answering \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;No\u0026quot; during dialogues or the command \u0026quot;Rescue\u0026quot; have been eliminated.","publishedBy":"Data West","developedBy":"Data West","released":"1988","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/4th-unit-2","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Data West","developer":"Data West","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
