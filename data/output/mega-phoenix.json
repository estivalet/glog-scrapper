{"name":"Mega Phoenix","description":"\u003ci\u003eMega Phoenix\u003c/i\u003e brings the concept of the earlier arcade game \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dPhoenix\"\u003ePhoenix\u003c/a\u003e into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?company\u003dGaelco\"\u003eGaelco\u003c/a\u003e. The game is a single-screen shoot â??em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.","publishedBy":"Dinamic Software","developedBy":"Creepsoft","released":"1991","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/mega-phoenix","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Dinamic Software","developer":"Creepsoft","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/445378-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/445379-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-the-high-scores.png","/images/shots/l/445380-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-get-ready-player-1.png","/images/shots/l/445381-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-fighting-through-the-first-wave.png","/images/shots/l/445382-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-your-enemies-will-dive-at-you.png","/images/shots/l/445383-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-almost-cleared.png","/images/shots/l/445384-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-well-done-wave-two.png","/images/shots/l/445385-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-they-got-me.png","/images/shots/l/445386-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-bad-luck.png","/images/shots/l/445387-mega-phoenix-msx-screenshot-you-are-finished.png"],"cover":[]}
