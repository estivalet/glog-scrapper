There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands (\u0026quot;Look\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Take\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Use\u0026quot;, etc.), represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.","publishedBy":"Tokyo†Shoseki†Co.,†Ltd.","developedBy":"Nihon†Falcom†Corp.","released":"Dec 10, 1987","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined†View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/taiy-no-shinden","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Tokyo Shoseki Co., Ltd.","developer":"Nihon Falcom Corp.","ported":"ZAP Corporation","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Dec 10, 1987","ean13":"4†961355†677025","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
