{"name":"Stormbringer","description":"\u003ci\u003eStormbringer\u003c/i\u003e is the fourth and final game to star Magic Knight, and the only one to make it onto 16-bit systems. Magic Knight must meet with his alter-ego, the Off-White Knight, by reaching his castle hideout - which means clearing 64 screens of adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire button calls up a menu of options, such as \u0027examine\u0027, \u0027pick up\u0027 or \u0027cast spell. Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise, and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.","publishedBy":"M.A.D.","developedBy":"","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/stormbringer","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"M.A.D.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012967 710040","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/409364-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/409365-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/409366-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-instructions.png","/images/shots/l/409367-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-starting-location.png","/images/shots/l/409368-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-i-examined-aramis.png","/images/shots/l/409369-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-i-guess-that-s-the-storm-that.png","/images/shots/l/409370-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-wish-me-love-a-wishing-well-to.png","/images/shots/l/409371-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-hmm-i-wonder-what-this-spell-does.png","/images/shots/l/409372-stormbringer-msx-screenshot-i-quiticus-gamus.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/169922-stormbringer-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169921-stormbringer-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169923-stormbringer-msx-media.jpg"]}
