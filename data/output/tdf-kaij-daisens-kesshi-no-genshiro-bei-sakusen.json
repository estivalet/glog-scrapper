The player must defend a populated area against a monster onslaught. The overhead area is divided into hexagonal fields. The player has at his disposal atomic power plants, which produce fuel, and bases of the T.D.F. organization scattered throughout the area. The player then selects and positions various types of units on the map. These types include planes, helicopters, mobile rocket launchers, ships, trucks, etc. All these can only be positioned on hexagons adjacent to a T.D.F. base. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe monsters are mostly dragon-like in appearance and consist of a few varieties.
