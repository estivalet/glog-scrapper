{"name":"Barnstormer","description":"You are a stunt pilot who are supposed to crash into a water tower, but your path is blocked by a multitude of hot-air balloons. To get them out of way, you must hit their baskets with flour bombs thrown out of your plane. While your plane can fly both up, down, left and right, it has a great inertia, and thus you risk at all times to run into one of the balloons or into the borders of the screen at an uncontrollable speed. Your speed also makes the bombs fall at different paths, which means that hitting the small baskets requires both precision and timing. The air is also filled with clouds that can release deadly bolts of lightning. Once all balloons are grounded, you should fly to the beginning of the screen and then pick up your speed so that you can smash straight through the water tower at the far end of the screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePoints are given for bombing balloons, flying through storm clouds, picking up fuel from the ground and breaking the tower. Extra lives are given each 10 000 points. Every second level takes place in daytime, every second one at night.","publishedBy":"Electric Software Limited","developedBy":"Electric Software Limited","released":"1985","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/barnstormer","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Electric Software Limited","developer":"Electric Software Limited","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":"Cassette"},{"publisher":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developer":"Electric Software Limited","ported":"","country":" The Netherlands","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":"Cassette"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/242080-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/242081-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-your-plane-a-hangar-and-two-balloons.png","/images/shots/l/242082-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-dropping-bombs-on-a-balloon.png","/images/shots/l/242083-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-crashed-into-a-balloon.png","/images/shots/l/242084-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-crashed-into-a-wall-who-put-that.png","/images/shots/l/242085-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-diving-for-a-fuel-tank.png","/images/shots/l/242088-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-flying-upside-down-above-grounded.png","/images/shots/l/242089-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-crashed-into-the-water-tower-not.png","/images/shots/l/242091-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-when-all-balloons-are-grounded.png","/images/shots/l/242094-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-flew-through-the-tower.png","/images/shots/l/242093-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-a-nightflight.png","/images/shots/l/242095-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-watch-out-for-the-yellow-spinning.png","/images/shots/l/242096-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-a-flash-of-lightning-turns-night.png","/images/shots/l/242097-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-penetrated-level-2.png","/images/shots/l/242098-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-level-three-takes-place-in-daytime.png","/images/shots/l/242099-barnstormer-msx-screenshot-high-score.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/90858-barnstormer-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/90859-barnstormer-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/90860-barnstormer-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/90861-barnstormer-msx-media.jpg"]}
