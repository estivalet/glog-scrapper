{"name":"Highway Encounter","description":"In this isometric 3D action-strategy game, the player uses a Vorton droid to push a bomb to the end of the highway into an alien base. There are 30 screens, most of them filled with hazards trying to block (like barrels) or destroy (mines and aliens) your bomb. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe perspective and guidance concept are not the game\u0027s only original features; there are 4 more bombs with you, representing your extra lives - pushing you forward on your mission. If these other Vortons are destroyed, one of your extra lives is lost without the player being able to use it.","publishedBy":"Vortex Software","developedBy":"Vortex Software","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Memotech MTX, Tatung Einstein, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"Bird\u0027s-eye view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/highway-encounter","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Vortex Software","developer":"Vortex Software","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/446002-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/446003-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-title-screen-main-menu-and.png","/images/shots/l/446004-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-form-up.png","/images/shots/l/446005-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-i-ve-cleared-a-path-and-on.png","/images/shots/l/446006-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-i-must-be-careful-of-enemies.png","/images/shots/l/446008-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-one-of-me-has-died.png","/images/shots/l/446010-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-i-killed-an-enemy.png","/images/shots/l/446015-highway-encounter-msx-screenshot-failure-the-vortons-were.png"],"cover":[]}
