{"name":"Q*bert","description":"Despite it\u0027s name, this \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dQ%2aBert+Series\"\u003eQ*Bert installment\u003c/a\u003e is not a port of the \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/arcade/qbert\"\u003efirst game\u003c/a\u003e, rather it\u0027s based on \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/qberts-qubes\"\u003eQ*Bert\u0027s Qubes\u003c/a\u003e. The player doesn\u0027t even control Q*Bert, but rather the dragon Wrappy. The gameplay is still focused on forming lines of blocks that match a target color, while enemies constantly enter the playfield. However there are now many different layouts in 50 different stages. Also added are differently colored blobs that function as power-ups when touched. Blue ones for example grant invincibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother addition are two-player simultaneous modes, where both players compete against each other, with or without enemies.The first player to complete a line of five of his target alignment wins. If the time runs out, the relevant blocks are counted, a draw leads to a round of rock-paper-scissors with a random result.
