{"name":"Kinetic Connection","description":"In \u003ci\u003eKinetic Connection\u003c/i\u003e you are presented with an array of blocks on one of 16 MicroKinema (levels), which are split from a square grid. Pick up, rotate and place the objects to form a mystery image in the grid. You can display the actual image you are attempting to mirror, but your limited fund of time depletes more quickly while this is visible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePuzzles can be broken down into between 4 and 96 pieces. Many of the MicroKinema are animated, which gives you clues as to what should be placed where, and which way up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuick thinking and creativity are the keys. The puzzles can be saved, and played alone or with a friend.","publishedBy":"Sony Corporation","developedBy":"","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Commodore 64, NES | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/kinetic-connection","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sony Corporation","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/133220-kinetic-connection-msx-screenshot-pick-one-of-the-pieces-below.png","/images/shots/l/133221-kinetic-connection-msx-screenshot-and-place-them-right.png","/images/shots/l/133222-kinetic-connection-msx-screenshot-can-you-solve-the-puzzle.png"],"cover":[]}
