{"name":"The Goonies","description":"While this MSX version of \u003ci\u003eThe Goonies\u003c/i\u003e borrows the basic concept from the \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/nes/goonies\"\u003eFamicom (NES) version\u003c/a\u003e, it features completely different levels and enemies.Rather than play Mikey and save the remaining Goonies, you play as Sloth who must rescue all the Goonies, meaning you need to rescue seven Goonies per stage instead of just one so the stages are significantly longer and more complicated.To open doors you need to use keys instead of bombs, and you can only carry one key at a time. There\u0027s also an experience meter that increases every time you kill an enemy.","publishedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/goonies__","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Konami Industry Co.
