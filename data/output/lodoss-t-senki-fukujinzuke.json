{"name":"Lodoss-T? Senki: Fukujinzuke","description":"\u003ci\u003eFukujinzuke\u003c/i\u003e has little to do with the Japanese pickled vegetables it was named after. Rather, it is a small humorous mini-game tribute to Humming Bird\u0027s role-playing game \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/record-of-lodoss-war-haiiro-no-majo\"\u003eRecord of Lodoss War: Haiiro no Majo\u003c/a\u003e. Besides a sound gallery feature, the game consists of three mini-games. The first is a puzzle which requires the player to assemble a picture by sliding disarranged fragments of it one at a time. The second is a recreation of a typical battle from the role-playing game, featuring a party of high-level characters entering a castle and fighting enemies in a turn-based encounter identical to those of \u003ci\u003eHaiiro no Majo\u003c/i\u003e. The third mini-game is a quiz concerning all things related to Record of Lodoss War.","publishedBy":"Humming Bird Soft","developedBy":"Humming Bird Soft","released":"Jul 13, 1990","alsoFor":"PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/lodoss-t-senki-fukujinzuke","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","developer":"Humming Bird Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Jul 13, 1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
