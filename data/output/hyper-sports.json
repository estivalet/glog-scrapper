{"name":"Hyper Sports","description":"Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling successor to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/arcade/track-field\"\u003eTrack \u0026Field\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSwimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.","publishedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Arcade, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, NES, PC-8000, Sharp X1, SG-1000, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Sports","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Olympiad / Mixed Sports","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/hyper-sports","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Konami Industry Co.
