{"name":"Space Maze Attack","description":"\u003ci\u003eSpace Maze Attack\u003c/i\u003e is a top-down shooter in which the player navigates a white spaceship in search of treasure through claustrophobic mazes that are infested with hostile aliens. The spacecraft is equipped with a simple peashooter and has limited energy. When the energy runs out, the spaceship explodes. Upon finding a treasure, the unused energy is converted to points and a new level starts. There is also a 2-player mode where two people can take turns in order to find out who can amass the highest score.","publishedBy":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","developedBy":"","released":"1983","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/space-maze-attack","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"HAL Laboratory, Inc.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1983","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/589408-space-maze-attack-msx-screenshot-the-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/589404-space-maze-attack-msx-screenshot-here-we-go.png","/images/shots/l/589403-space-maze-attack-msx-screenshot-they-re-out-to-get-me.png","/images/shots/l/589405-space-maze-attack-msx-screenshot-contact.png","/images/shots/l/589407-space-maze-attack-msx-screenshot-status-critical.png","/images/shots/l/589406-space-maze-attack-msx-screenshot-i-ve-found-the-treasure.png"],"cover":[]}
