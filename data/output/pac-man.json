{"name":"Pac-Man","description":"One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980\u0027s, \u003cem\u003ePac-Man\u003c/em\u003e stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePac-Man\u0027s goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts\u0027 eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.","publishedBy":"Bug-Byte Software Ltd.","developedBy":"Namco Limited","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Android, Apple II, Arcade, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit, BlackBerry, Commodore 64, FM-7, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Intellivision, iPhone, Neo Geo Pocket Color, NES, Nintendo 3DS, Palm OS, PC-6001, PC-88, PC-98, PC Booter, PlayStation 4, Sharp X1, Sharp Zaurus, TI-99/4A, VIC-20, Wii, Wii U, Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox 360, Xbox One, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pac-man","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Microbyte","developer":"Namco Limited","ported":"","country":" Spain","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":"Cartridge version.
