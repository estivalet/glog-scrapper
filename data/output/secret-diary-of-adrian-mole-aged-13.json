{"name":"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13¾","description":"\u003ca href\u003d\"/developer/sheet/view/developerId,488206/\"\u003eSue Townsend\u003c/a\u003e created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd idea for a computer game, but \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?company\u003dLevel+9+Computing%2c+Ltd%2e\"\u003eLevel 9\u003c/a\u003e felt that there was an adventure in there.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian\u0027s warring parents and their respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game didn\u0027t use many typed commands. You would read passages of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to other events unfolding.  You could also use a help option which would display information about characters featured in the diary. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible.  The player\u0027s score and ranking is displayed at particular times during the game.  The percentage achieved relates to the rank, with 26% being \u0027a spotty creep\u0027 and 38% \u0027a middling thicko\u0027 for example.
