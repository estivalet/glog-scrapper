{"name":"Young Sherlock: The Legacy of Doyle","description":"On the December of 1875, a millionaire called Doyle was murdered and Cindy, his daughter, was found at the crime scene. Roger, her fianc√©, hires a young Sherlock Holmes to clear her name and help on the investigation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eYoung Sherlock: The Legacy of Doyle\u003c/i\u003e is a Japanese adventure based on the movie \u003ci\u003eYoung Sherlock Holmes\u003c/i\u003e (1985), although it has a completely different plot. Controlling Holmes and Watson, the player must investigate the murder of a millionaire by questioning witnesses and investigating parts of London. The screen is divided in three parts: a window at the bottom for text output, and above it an illustrative picture and a verb list. The verb commands used to interact with the game world are \u0026quot;walk\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;examine\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;talk\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;listen\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;show\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;take\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;inventory\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;use\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the player walks from one place to the other, the picture portion transforms into an overhead map of London where a red square shows the position of Holmes and Watson. The player can move this square with the arrow keys, and position it over an interactive area to access it (the game writes a small description of the places the square touches).","publishedBy":"Pack-In-Video†Co.,†Ltd","developedBy":"CCS","released":"1987","alsoFor":"","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","developer":"CCS","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/228831-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/228832-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-introduction.png","/images/shots/l/228833-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-doyle-mansion.png","/images/shots/l/228834-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-moving-around.png","/images/shots/l/228835-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-crime-scene.png","/images/shots/l/228836-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-victim-s.png","/images/shots/l/228837-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-cindy-s.png","/images/shots/l/228838-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-doyle-s.png","/images/shots/l/228839-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-rosane-s.png","/images/shots/l/228840-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-living-room.png","/images/shots/l/228841-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-shack.png","/images/shots/l/228842-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-scotland.png","/images/shots/l/228843-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-lestrade.png","/images/shots/l/228844-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-the-british.png","/images/shots/l/228845-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-library.png","/images/shots/l/228846-young-sherlock-the-legacy-of-doyle-msx-screenshot-some-bums.png"],"cover":[]}
