{"name":"Kimi Dake ni Ai o...","description":"It\u0027s a cause for celebration: the lovely Misa has decided to marry her sweetheart Satoshi. Former schoolmates attend the wedding ceremony. But not all of them are unconditionally happy for the couple. Among those is the protagonist of the game, a young man named Akio, who has always looked up to Satoshi and considered him his older brother. Does Akio harbor \u0026quot;forbidden\u0026quot; feelings to the one whom he must now treat as sister?..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eKimi Dake ni Ai o...\u003c/i\u003e is a Japanese-style adventure. The player choose verb commands from a menu (\u0026quot;Examine\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Talk\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Think\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Move\u0026quot;, etc.), which in turn lead to lists of themes and objects. Usually the next event is triggered when the player has gone through all possible verb/object combinations; sometimes, a more unrestricted navigation is possible. The game has explicit sex sequences, during which the verb commands change into rather detailed sexual instructions, with \u0026quot;objects\u0026quot; to match.","publishedBy":"Game Technopolis","developedBy":"Game Technopolis","released":"1991","alsoFor":"PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/kimi-dake-ni-ai-o","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Game Technopolis","developer":"Game Technopolis","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
