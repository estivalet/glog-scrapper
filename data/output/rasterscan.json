{"name":"Rasterscan","description":"Controlling the spherical MSB, a repair droid which has lost most of its capabilities, only you can repair the Rasterscan spaceship and bring it back under control. The first job is to get the droid repaired, after which you must regain control of the power generator and the engines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is controlled by moving MSB directly, with a teleport facility on the droid allowing you to move one object at a time. Spanner-type devices are mounted from the floor - guiding MSB into the top of these reveals puzzles which can be used to unlock doors to reach other sections of the ship. Before any power can be generated and the ship\u0027s scanner accessed, a leak must be fixed by finding and using a piece of spare piping.","publishedBy":"Mastertronic Ltd.","developedBy":"Binary Design, Ltd.","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, PC Booter, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/rasterscan","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Mastertronic Ltd.","developer":"Binary Design, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012967 700720","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/129647-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/129648-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-the-beginning-location.png","/images/shots/l/129649-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-this-wrench-like-device-can-transport.png","/images/shots/l/129650-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-exploring-what-have-i-found-here.png","/images/shots/l/129651-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-one-of-the-logic-puzzles.png","/images/shots/l/129652-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-down-in-a-corner-of-the-ship.png","/images/shots/l/129653-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-exploring-the-spaceship.png","/images/shots/l/129654-rasterscan-msx-screenshot-found-some-assorted-devices-in-the.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118694-rasterscan-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118695-rasterscan-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118693-rasterscan-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120722-rasterscan-msx-media.jpg"]}
