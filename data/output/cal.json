She tells the hero that soon he will be needed in that world... and disappears. Was that a dream? Or will our hero really travel to the magical world of Cal and encounter dangers he hasn\u0027t even imagined before?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eCal\u003c/i\u003e is a visual novel, with the sole interaction consisting of choosing sentences to say and sometimes actions to do from a context-specific menu at the bottom of the screen.
