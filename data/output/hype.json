{"name":"Hype","description":"A very, very fast vertical shoot\u0027em up game. The goal is to destroy the various hordes of enemies in space using the simple or special shots that are picked up. The game is not separated by levels or big bosses, it is played straight from the beginning until all lives run out, accompanied by fast-paced music.","publishedBy":"Eaglesoft","developedBy":"The Bytebusters","released":"1987","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/hype","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Eaglesoft","developer":"The Bytebusters","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/833334-hype-msx-screenshot-main-screen.png","/images/shots/l/833335-hype-msx-screenshot-hordes-of-enemies.png","/images/shots/l/833336-hype-msx-screenshot-zone-2.png","/images/shots/l/833337-hype-msx-screenshot-loading-intro.png"],"cover":[]}
