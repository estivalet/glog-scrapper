{"name":"Super Tritorn","description":"Real-Time Role Playing Adventure game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is a big maze where you need to find objects, primary amongst them seem to be bottles of different colours. The game is laggy, in particular when wielding your weapon. Enemies in the first couple of screens don\u0027t seem to do you any real harm. You can kill them typically with a single hit, and you can even walk over them. Killing enemies gives you experience (EXP), and when your experience bar is full your life bar increases (H.P). After a few screens though the enemies suddenly get a lot tougher and can kill you almost immediately.","publishedBy":"Sein-Soft","developedBy":"Sein-Soft","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/super-tritorn","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sein-Soft","developer":"Sein-Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/836699-super-tritorn-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/836703-super-tritorn-msx-screenshot-start-of-the-gameplay.png","/images/shots/l/836704-super-tritorn-msx-screenshot-underground.png","/images/shots/l/836708-super-tritorn-msx-screenshot-got-myself-a-green-bottle.png","/images/shots/l/836706-super-tritorn-msx-screenshot-that-s-a-door-at-the-right.png","/images/shots/l/836709-super-tritorn-msx-screenshot-oops-these-enemies-kill-you-quickly.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/327813-super-tritorn-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327814-super-tritorn-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327812-super-tritorn-msx-media.jpg"]}
