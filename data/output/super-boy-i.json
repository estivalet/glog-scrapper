{"name":"Super Boy I","description":"\u003ci\u003eSuper Boy I\u003c/i\u003e is a Korean-made unlicensed conversion of \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/super-mario-bros\"\u003eSuper Mario Bros.\u003c/a\u003e. It imports the sprites of Mario and all of the enemies, terrain ingredients, as well as basic gameplay mechanics. The levels resemble those of the original game, most notably the earlier ones; however, only outdoor areas and simplified castles (some without any enemies except Bowser) are included. The game ends after three worlds, each divided into three stages and a castle level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis version omits much of the material found in \u003ci\u003eSuper Mario Bros.\u003c/i\u003e. There are no power-ups except the mushroom (which is placed randomly); no warp points; no bonus levels; no cave or underwater areas. Falling platforms replace elevators; pipes cannot be entered. Castles can be completed without defeating the guarding Bowsers. In the castle\u0027s final area the player is greeted by the words \u0026quot;Sorry Nothing\u0026quot;. The princess is not mentioned at all.","publishedBy":"Zemina Co.","developedBy":"Zemina Co.","released":"Jan, 1989","alsoFor":"SEGA Master System | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/super-boy-i","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Zemina Co.","developer":"Zemina Co.","ported":"","country":" South Korea","releaseDate":"Jan, 1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/837265-super-boy-i-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/837266-super-boy-i-msx-screenshot-it-s-mario.png","/images/shots/l/837267-super-boy-i-msx-screenshot-jumping-around.png","/images/shots/l/837268-super-boy-i-msx-screenshot-climbing.png","/images/shots/l/837269-super-boy-i-msx-screenshot-we-made-it-to-the-second-level.png","/images/shots/l/837270-super-boy-i-msx-screenshot-we-got-a-mushroom-and-got-larger.png","/images/shots/l/837271-super-boy-i-msx-screenshot-it-s-koopa.png"],"cover":[]}
