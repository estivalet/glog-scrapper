{"name":"Sharkey\u0027s 3D Pool","description":"\u003ci\u003eSharkey\u0027s 3D Pool\u003c/i\u003e is one of the earliest 3D cue-sports games, featuring a fully-rotating table and variable viewpoint allowing for much more realistic shot-playing than the traditional top-down game style (although the game can be played this way instead). The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.","publishedBy":"Firebird Software","developedBy":"Aardvark Software","released":"1989","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, DOS, Electron, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Sports","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Pool / Snooker","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/sharkeys-3d-pool","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Firebird Software","developer":"Aardvark Software","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/548818-sharkey-s-3d-pool-msx-screenshot-tournament-draw.png","/images/shots/l/548819-sharkey-s-3d-pool-msx-screenshot-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/548820-sharkey-s-3d-pool-msx-screenshot-set-the-cue-ball.png","/images/shots/l/548821-sharkey-s-3d-pool-msx-screenshot-looking-at-the-table-from.png"],"cover":[]}
