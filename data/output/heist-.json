{"name":"The Heist","description":"As a cat burglar, it\u0027s up to you to collect all of the valuable paintings from each level while avoiding security systems, pits and robotic sentries which move back and forth. Each level is comprised of three floors and ladders connecting them. Your cat burglar has only the ability to jump, and you must rely entirely on that to keep you alive.","publishedBy":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developedBy":"Livesay Technologies","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, FM-7, PC-88 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/heist-","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Aackosoft International B.V.","developer":"Livesay Technologies","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/130899-the-heist-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/130900-the-heist-msx-screenshot-start-of-the-game.png","/images/shots/l/130901-the-heist-msx-screenshot-the-escalator-goes-only-down.png","/images/shots/l/130902-the-heist-msx-screenshot-jump-the-gaps.png","/images/shots/l/130903-the-heist-msx-screenshot-brick-walls-appear-out-of-nothing.png","/images/shots/l/130904-the-heist-msx-screenshot-run-there-is-not-too-much-time.png","/images/shots/l/130905-the-heist-msx-screenshot-use-the-elevator-to-change-floors.png","/images/shots/l/130906-the-heist-msx-screenshot-remove-the-paintings-without-warning.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118612-the-heist-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118611-the-heist-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120735-the-heist-msx-media.jpg"]}
