It is a short visual novel focusing on the erotic adventures of two young Japanese girls, Ayayo and Tomoko. The game begins with the girls deciding how to spend the holiday. From that point on, depending on the player\u0027s choices, the story splits into three vignettes: going to see an erotic movie, buying shoes, or reading erotic books. Each story invariably concludes with a sex scene.","publishedBy":"HARD","developedBy":"HARD","released":"Oct 16, 1990","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/hacchake-ayayo-san-2-ikenai-holiday","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"HARD","developer":"HARD","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Oct 16, 1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
