{"name":"Serra Pelada","description":"\u003ci\u003eJo√£o Dente-de-Ouro (\u0026quot;John Goldtooth\u0026quot;) was a miner in Serra Pelada (\u0026quot;Naked mountain range\u0026quot;), a Brazilian region that had a gold rush from 1980 until 1991. He chanced upon an enormous 154 pounds gold nugget that received the nickname \u0026quot;Foreign Debt\u0026quot; by the rejoicing locals. Four days after that discovery, Jo√£o and the gold mysteriously disappeared while the festivities took place.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eSerra Pelada\u003c/i\u003e is a text adventure from Brazil. The second adventure from \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?developer\u003dRenato+Degiovani\"\u003eRenato Degiovani\u003c/a\u003e, it was developed with the same set of tools used to create \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/amaznia\"\u003eAmaz√¥nia\u003c/a\u003e. It also shares the first game\u0027s limited parser (it recognizes pronouns, but can\u0027t chain commands), but this time the accentuation of Portuguese words is optional. The player has 8 days to find the gold nugget (in-game time passes faster than in reality). Once the correct equipment is acquired, gold can be mined and sold, and the money received can be used to buy some necessary objects and bribe other characters. As a navigation aid, a segmented map of the place can be displayed with the \u003cb\u003eMAPA\u003c/b\u003e command. The main danger comes in the form of common thieves and the hazardous dilapidated topography of the region (the prospecting was performed in open air, there wasn\u0027t any mines).","publishedBy":"","developedBy":"","released":"1987","alsoFor":"TRS-80, ZX Spectrum | Combined†View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/serra-pelada","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/229395-serra-pelada-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/229396-serra-pelada-msx-screenshot-introduction-good-luck-and-that.png","/images/shots/l/229397-serra-pelada-msx-screenshot-verb-list.png","/images/shots/l/229398-serra-pelada-msx-screenshot-map-airport-and-other-areas.png","/images/shots/l/229399-serra-pelada-msx-screenshot-map-jail-and-other-areas.png","/images/shots/l/229400-serra-pelada-msx-screenshot-instructions.png","/images/shots/l/229401-serra-pelada-msx-screenshot-map-digging-sites.png"],"cover":[]}
