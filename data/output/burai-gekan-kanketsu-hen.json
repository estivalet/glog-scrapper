{"name":"Burai: Gekan - Kanketsu-hen","description":"The game is a direct follow-up to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/burai-jkan\"\u003eBurai: JÅ?kan\u003c/a\u003e, continuing its story. The eight heroes who were chosen by the magical pearls to stop the plans of the evil Bido to resurrect the dark god Daar continue their journeys. The young demon warrior Jakimaru is angry at Hayate for killing his companion, and he offers his service to Bido, who still hopes to defeat the eight heroes. As before, the player can choose to start as any of the heroes. However, since some of the heroes got together during the course of the previous game (Alec and Kuuku, Hayate and Lilian, etc.), there are only five different chapters to start with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe core gameplay remains the same - top-down navigation, random enemies, turn-based combat. However, the battles use the same turn-based perspective as over-world navigation (as opposed to the first-person view in \u003ci\u003eBurai: JÅ?kan\u003c/i\u003e).","publishedBy":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","developedBy":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","released":"Nov, 1992","alsoFor":"FM Towns, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/burai-gekan-kanketsu-hen","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","developer":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Nov, 1992","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
