{"name":"The Activision Decathlon","description":"\u003ci\u003eThe Activision Decathlon\u003c/i\u003e is a series of Olympic games similar to \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dEpyx\"\u003ethe Epyx games series\u003c/a\u003e. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.","publishedBy":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","developedBy":"Activision, Inc.","released":"1984","alsoFor":"Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit, ColecoVision, Commodore 64 | Combined View","genre":"Sports","perspective":"3rd-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Olympiad / Mixed Sports","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/activision-decathlon","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Pony Canyon, Inc.","developer":"Activision, Inc.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1984","ean13":"","comments":"Cartridge version"},{"publisher":"Activision, Inc.","developer":"Activision, Inc.","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131426-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-openings-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131427-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-100-meters-sprint.png","/images/shots/l/131428-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-the-long-jump.png","/images/shots/l/131429-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-the-high-jump.png","/images/shots/l/131430-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-400-meters-race.png","/images/shots/l/131431-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-discus-throw.png","/images/shots/l/131432-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-the-pole-jump.png","/images/shots/l/131433-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-the-javlin-throw.png","/images/shots/l/131434-the-activision-decathlon-msx-screenshot-1500-meters-race.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/117466-the-activision-decathlon-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117465-the-activision-decathlon-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120741-the-activision-decathlon-msx-media.jpg"]}
