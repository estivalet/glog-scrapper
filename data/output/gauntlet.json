{"name":"Gauntlet","description":"\u003ci\u003eGauntlet\u003c/i\u003e is an action game where players choose characters and fight their way through hordes of enemies that assault them on the way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game features a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGhosts, goblins and even the life-draining Death are among the enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces the character\u0027s energy level.Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to the player\u0027s score.","publishedBy":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","developedBy":"Atari Games Corporation","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Apple IIgs, Arcade, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, J2ME, Macintosh, SEGA Master System, Xbox 360, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/gauntlet","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","developer":"Atari Games Corporation","ported":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","country":" France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 013442 534717","comments":""},{"publisher":"Kixx","developer":"Atari Games Corporation","ported":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"5 013442 534717","comments":"Budget release"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/337162-gauntlet-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/337163-gauntlet-msx-screenshot-introduction-part-1-credits-and-info.png","/images/shots/l/337164-gauntlet-msx-screenshot-introduction-part-2-how-to-play-the.png","/images/shots/l/337165-gauntlet-msx-screenshot-player-one-select-a-character.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118598-gauntlet-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118597-gauntlet-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120738-gauntlet-msx-media.jpg"]}
