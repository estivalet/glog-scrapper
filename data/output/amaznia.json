{"name":"Amazônia","description":"The engine of your airplane stops while you are flying over the amazon forest, forcing it to make an emergency landing. Alone and without proper equipment, you need to transverse the great forest to reach civilization while avoiding deadly wild animals and several other kinds of dangers on the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eAmazÃ´nia\u003c/i\u003e is a text-adventure in Portuguese from Brazil. One of the first computer games commercially released on that country, it has a parser inspired by the ones of \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?company\u003dInfocom\"\u003eInfocom\u003c/a\u003e and other companies, although not nearly as sophisticated (it has a small vocabulary of  40 or so verbs, it can\u0027t process chain commands, but understands pronouns). One unique characteristic of it is the requirement of accentuation on the Portuguese words. The game even provides special key combinations as shortcuts for accents to ensure compatibility with all systems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven the plot line, the gameplay has a strong emphasis on its survival aspect: even though it is written in first person, the game bizarrely complains about being thirsty (\u0026quot;Hey, I\u0027m thirsty!\u0026quot;). Wild animals randomly appear to threaten the player, and must be dealt swiftly to avoid death.","publishedBy":"JVA Microcomputadores Ltda","developedBy":"","released":"1986","alsoFor":"TRS-80, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/amaznia","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"JVA Microcomputadores Ltda","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Brazil","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/226055-amazonia-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/226056-amazonia-msx-screenshot-introduction-good-luck-partner.png","/images/shots/l/226057-amazonia-msx-screenshot-instructions.png","/images/shots/l/226058-amazonia-msx-screenshot-verb-list.png","/images/shots/l/226059-amazonia-msx-screenshot-eaten-by-a-jaguar.png"],"cover":[]}
