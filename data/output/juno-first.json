There are only a few moments before the atomic turbine missile encounters the enemy. As a pilot of a space fighter you have to shoot your way through waves of aliens. You can escape the danger by using warps and special objects - to be collected en route. The aliens will mutate into more dangerous forms the longer they live so don\u0027t let the aliens survive.","publishedBy":"Sony Computer Entertainment Japan","developedBy":"Konami Industry Co. Ltd.","released":"1983","alsoFor":"Arcade, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, PC Booter | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Bird\u0027s-eye view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/juno-first","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment Japan","developer":"Konami Industry Co.
