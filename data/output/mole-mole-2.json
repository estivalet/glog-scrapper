{"name":"Mole Mole 2","description":"The follow-up to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/mole-mole\"\u003eMole Mole\u003c/a\u003e plays exactly like the original, which means that it is very close to \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dBoulder+Dash\"\u003eBoulder Dash\u003c/a\u003e but at a slower pace, since each move requires planning, whereas falling boulders won\u0027t kill you. Three difficulty levels are on offer: \u003ci\u003eSelections, Children\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eExperts\u003c/i\u003e. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.","publishedBy":"Cross Media Soft","developedBy":"","released":"1987","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88 | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/mole-mole-2","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Cross Media Soft","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/239400-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/239381-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/239391-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-stage-1.png","/images/shots/l/239392-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-overview-of-stage-1-can-you-read.png","/images/shots/l/239393-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-let-the-blocks-fall-down-so-you.png","/images/shots/l/239395-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-reached-the-exit.png","/images/shots/l/239396-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-level-clear.png","/images/shots/l/239397-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-the-papayas-on-the-floor-should.png","/images/shots/l/239398-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-stage-2-in-overview.png","/images/shots/l/239379-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-burrowing-into-the-tree-to-pick.png","/images/shots/l/239380-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-level-overview.png","/images/shots/l/239384-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-i-can-t-get-up-and-give-up.png","/images/shots/l/239386-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-on-children-s-stage-4-and-once.png","/images/shots/l/239388-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-going-from-stage-to-stage.png","/images/shots/l/239389-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-don-t-ask-me-how-you-d-ever-get.png","/images/shots/l/239390-mole-mole-2-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
