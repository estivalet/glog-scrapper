There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike\u0027s handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it\u0027s game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a computer opponent, but the scoring isn\u0027t affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify.
