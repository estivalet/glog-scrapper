{"name":"Illumina","description":"A young man wakes up, only to find himself in a bed, in an unknown house, in an unknown place. A lovely girl enters. She says that her name is Ryuuna and that she is practicing the art of White Magic as a priest. However, the young man cannot remember anything. He cannot even remember his own name. Ryuuna says that he was found unconscious outside of the village, with a pendant lying nearby. There is just one name written there, his name: Seraphis. Also, there is a strange engraving on his hand. Who is he really? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eIllumina\u003c/i\u003e is a rather basic Japanese-style RPG. The party of the heroes walk over the top-down world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. With a few exceptions, the towns are displayed as identically-looking pictures of locations, with menu-based navigation, \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/spell-of-destruction\"\u003e Wizardry\u003c/a\u003e-style. The random, turn-based battles are also first-person, but the dungeons have the same top-down view as the map. Playable characters belong to defined classes (such as Ryuuna being a priest with various white magic spells that can be leveled up). If any character is killed in a battle, it\u0027s Game Over. There are several scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.","publishedBy":"Cocktail Soft","developedBy":"Cocktail Soft","released":"1991","alsoFor":"PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"1st-person, Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/illumina","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Cocktail Soft","developer":"Cocktail Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1991","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
