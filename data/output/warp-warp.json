{"name":"Warp Warp","description":"In this game you \u0027re in control of a monster fighter. A warp zone is set in the middle of the screen. Warp to the next level when it flashes. You should attack the monsters before they catch or shoot you. A frog turns up occasionally, shoot it for bonuses. The monsters become more vicious when they change color (they turn from yellow to red to purple). The red and the purple monsters are severe chasers.","publishedBy":"Namcot","developedBy":"Namco Limited","released":"Feb 19, 1984","alsoFor":"Arcade, Casio PV-1000, Sord M5 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/warp-warp","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Namcot","developer":"Namco Limited","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Feb 19, 1984","ean13":"","comments":""},{"publisher":"Bug-Byte Software Ltd.","developer":"Namco Limited","ported":"","country":" The Netherlands","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"5 013248 001000","comments":"Double cassette case"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131840-warp-warp-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131841-warp-warp-msx-screenshot-level-start.png","/images/shots/l/131842-warp-warp-msx-screenshot-shoot-the-frog-for-bonus-points.png","/images/shots/l/131843-warp-warp-msx-screenshot-shoot-the-monsters.png","/images/shots/l/131844-warp-warp-msx-screenshot-they-change-color-and-are-more-difficult.png","/images/shots/l/131845-warp-warp-msx-screenshot-you-lost.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/117711-warp-warp-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117712-warp-warp-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117710-warp-warp-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169851-warp-warp-msx-media.jpg","/images/covers/l/117790-warp-warp-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117791-warp-warp-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/117789-warp-warp-msx-media.jpg"]}
