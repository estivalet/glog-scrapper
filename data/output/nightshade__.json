{"name":"Nightshade","description":"Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the purple Mountains lies a valley. Time was that this area was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eNightshade\u003c/i\u003e is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier \u003cmoby company\u003d\"Ultimate Play\"\u003eUltimate titles such as \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/knight-lore\"\u003eKnight Lore\u003c/a\u003e, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have any.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to do this.","publishedBy":"Nippon Dexter Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Bird\u0027s-eye view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/nightshade__","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Nippon Dexter Co., Ltd.","developer":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/447035-nightshade-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/447036-nightshade-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/447037-nightshade-msx-screenshot-an-enemy.png","/images/shots/l/447038-nightshade-msx-screenshot-i-ve-been-hit-once.png","/images/shots/l/447039-nightshade-msx-screenshot-i-ve-been-hit-twice-and-this-guy.png","/images/shots/l/447040-nightshade-msx-screenshot-i-lost-a-life.png","/images/shots/l/447041-nightshade-msx-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-lives-game-over.png"],"cover":[]}
