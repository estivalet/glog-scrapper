{"name":"Hunchback","description":"Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle parapets by an invincible knight in full armour.  Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you\u0027re tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously. Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!  Even an able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but the player must succeed controlling a handicapped person.","publishedBy":"Tomo Soft International","developedBy":"Century Electronics","released":"1985","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Arcade, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, DOS, Dragon 32/64, Electron, Oric, VIC-20, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/hunchback","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Tomo Soft International","developer":"Century Electronics","ported":"Ocean Software Ltd.","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/440893-hunchback-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/440894-hunchback-msx-screenshot-high-scores.png","/images/shots/l/440895-hunchback-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/440896-hunchback-msx-screenshot-i-was-hit-by-a-fireball.png","/images/shots/l/440897-hunchback-msx-screenshot-if-you-take-too-long-the-soldier.png","/images/shots/l/440898-hunchback-msx-screenshot-i-reached-the-bell.png","/images/shots/l/440899-hunchback-msx-screenshot-time-to-make-like-pitfall-harry.png","/images/shots/l/440900-hunchback-msx-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-lives-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118566-hunchback-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118567-hunchback-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118565-hunchback-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120672-hunchback-msx-media.jpg"]}
