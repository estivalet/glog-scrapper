{"name":"Jack the Nipper... II in Coconut Capers","description":"Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Africa, with the aim of progressing through 192 screens of platform action. He starts with nine lives but no weapons, although a supply of coconuts to lob is close at hand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe jungle is full of snakes, rhinos, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as naughty as possible, which is gauged by a \u0027Naughty-O-Meter\u0027 next to the score, with numerous objects available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).
