{"name":"Time Trax","description":"Dark forces have set out to destroy the fabric of time, by opening eight space-time continuum portals. Each one is guarded by a great mind, who must have a relevant object returned to them before they will allow you to seal the portals. Doing this requires formulating a spell from the runes the Minds give you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is played out in a combination of side-view action and icon-based object manipulation. Starting in your living room as you search for a weapon and its bullets, you move along a network of levels and ladders, avoiding or shooting the many foes you encounter. Pressing down and fire together brings up a menu allowing you to pick up items, swap them with Guardians, and cast spells (with the chance to test them first).","publishedBy":"Bug-Byte Software Ltd.","developedBy":"Binary Design, Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/time-trax","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Bug-Byte Software Ltd.","developer":"Binary Design, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 013248 670657","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/446861-time-trax-msx-screenshot-title-and-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/446862-time-trax-msx-screenshot-starting-the-game.png","/images/shots/l/446863-time-trax-msx-screenshot-ghost.png","/images/shots/l/446864-time-trax-msx-screenshot-yikes-now-there-are-two-i-have-the.png","/images/shots/l/446865-time-trax-msx-screenshot-i-am-dead.png","/images/shots/l/446866-time-trax-msx-screenshot-my-ranking-is-pudding.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118623-time-trax-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118624-time-trax-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118622-time-trax-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
