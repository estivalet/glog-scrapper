The original work as well as the game\u0027s plot focus on the construction of a nuclear shelter called \u0026quot;The Dome\u0026quot;, capable of protecting humans from an impending atomic war. The player takes the role of an employee in an advertisement company, whose job is to raise people\u0027s awareness of the shelter\u0027s importance, and donate money to the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game opens System Sacom\u0027s \u003ci\u003eNovel Ware\u003c/i\u003e series, demonstrating its concept. Though its basic gameplay is that of a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure, the game has extended dialogue and text descriptions that either do not contain any interaction or occasionally prompt the player to make a choice. Despite this visual novel-like feature, the game still retains considerable portions of interactivity, with verb-object commands, reviewing information concerning recent events and characters in the game, and even the possibility to take and examine objects. The game\u0027s graphics consist of digitized photos of people and objects, and are rather sparse.","publishedBy":"System Sacom","developedBy":"System Sacom","released":"1988","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dome","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"System Sacom","developer":"System Sacom","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
