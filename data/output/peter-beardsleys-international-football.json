{"name":"Peter Beardsley\u0027s International Football","description":"Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there\u0027s no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can\u0027t be quit out of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.","publishedBy":"Grandslam Entertainments Ltd.","developedBy":"Teque London Ltd.","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Sports","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"Football (European) / Soccer","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/peter-beardsleys-international-football","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Grandslam Entertainments Ltd.","developer":"Teque London Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"5 013248 003035","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/138363-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-loading.png","/images/shots/l/138364-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-the.png","/images/shots/l/138365-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-the.png","/images/shots/l/138366-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-west.png","/images/shots/l/138367-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-let.png","/images/shots/l/138368-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-you.png","/images/shots/l/138369-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-he.png","/images/shots/l/138370-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-screenshot-yep.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118793-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118792-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120734-peter-beardsley-s-international-football-msx-media.jpg"]}
