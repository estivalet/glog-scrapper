The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider \u0027disturbing\u0027 from \u003ci\u003eRTK I\u003c/i\u003e (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). \u003ci\u003eRTK\u003c/i\u003e can be said to be much more \u0027stable\u0027 where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The \u003ci\u003eRTK II\u003c/i\u003e gameplay and interface is closely similar to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/nobunagas-ambition-ii\"\u003eNobunaga\u0027s Ambition II\u003c/a\u003e.","publishedBy":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","released":"1990","alsoFor":"Amiga, DOS, FM Towns, Genesis, NES, PC-88, PC-98, PlayStation, Sharp X1, Sharp X68000, SNES, Windows | Combined View","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/141374-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-koei-logo.png","/images/shots/l/141376-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-the-game-story.png","/images/shots/l/141377-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-select-a-scenario.png","/images/shots/l/141378-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-the-map-of.png","/images/shots/l/141379-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-select-a-character.png","/images/shots/l/141380-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-prepare-for.png","/images/shots/l/141381-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-lot-s-of-options.png","/images/shots/l/141382-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-let-s-conquer.png","/images/shots/l/141383-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-introduction.png","/images/shots/l/141384-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-dong-zhuo.png","/images/shots/l/141385-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-one-of-your.png","/images/shots/l/141386-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-they-will.png","/images/shots/l/141387-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/141388-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii-msx-screenshot-credits-screen.png"],"cover":[]}
