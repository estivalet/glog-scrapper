{"name":"Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze","description":"\u003ci\u003eGaudi: Barcelona no Kaze\u003c/i\u003e was the first adventure developed by \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?company\u003dwolf+team\"\u003e Wolf Team\u003c/a\u003e. It takes place in the Spanish city of Barcelona, which just the year before the release of the game was chosen for the celebration of the 25th Olympic Games. This is important to mention as the game takes place in the summer of 1992, the time at which the Olympic Games were being held in Barcelona.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is a classic graphical adventure with static images and text, with the occasional appearance of small menus that ask you which action you want to execute next. Hard-boiled stories will be touching each corner of the most emblematic spaces of the city (which had been digitalized for the occasion, with special mention to the monuments designed by Spanish architect Antoni Gaud√≠). The stories have all the elements of a thriller, including terrorist attacks, characters with a dark past, romance, crime, etc. all this accompanied by elegant Latin jazz throughout the adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e","publishedBy":"Wolf†Team","developedBy":"Wolf†Team","released":"Jul 28, 1989","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined†View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Wolf Team","developer":"Wolf Team","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Jul 28, 1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/472746-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-wolf-team-modified.png","/images/shots/l/472747-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-someone-is-about-to.png","/images/shots/l/472748-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-gaudi-s-building-gets.png","/images/shots/l/472749-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-too-much-light-i-barely.png","/images/shots/l/472750-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/472751-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-the-sagrada-familia.png","/images/shots/l/472752-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-one-man-with-a-broken.png","/images/shots/l/472753-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-throws-a-bouquet-to.png","/images/shots/l/472754-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-you-start-the-game.png","/images/shots/l/472755-gaudi-barcelona-no-kaze-msx-screenshot-talking-to-a-man.png"],"cover":[]}
