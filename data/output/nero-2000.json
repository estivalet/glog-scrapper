You choose to compete in four question categories, each including approximately 500 questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe categories are:\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eSports, dialect words and foreign words\u003cli\u003eGeneral knowledge, geography and literature\u003cli\u003eTravel, literature, general knowledge and nature\u003cli\u003eGeneral knowledge, art and movies\u003c/ol\u003eThe game can be played against the computer AI or a human opponent on a shared computer. Answers need to be typed on a keyboard. The game proceeds in turns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game can be won in two ways. One is to get all the points from your opponent and another way is to get all ten \u0026quot;correct answer\u0026quot; -markers (light bulbs on Commodore version) lit before your opponent does so. These markers are lit whenever you answer a question correctly, unless you choose before seeing a new question to attack your opponent and try to black out one of their markers with your correct answer instead. In a single player game, the AI opponent never answers a question, but gets a marker lit whenever you answer incorrectly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth players start with 100 points and they may choose to bet any number of the points before a question is revealed. This amount of points will be stolen from your opponent upon a correct answer and lost when the answer is incorrect. There is also a randomized bonus multiplier of 2 to 4 to the initial bet, which is given to the winner, but not reduced from the loser\u0027s points. Running out of points will end the game as well.","publishedBy":"Bio-Syntax Method Oy","developedBy":"Bio-Syntax Method Oy","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Commodore 64, DOS | Combined View","genre":"Educational","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/nero-2000","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Bio-Syntax Method Oy","developer":"Bio-Syntax Method Oy","ported":"","country":" Finland","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
