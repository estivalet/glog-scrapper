{"name":"Monopoly","description":"This version of the classic board game supports several graphic formats and offers some different options. From 2 to 8 players can play the game, and they can all be computer players if you wish. This allows you to just sit back and watch as the computer takes over.  You can choose to play a short game with a specified time limit, or a standard game, and there is a save game feature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll actions are handled entirely by keyboard. Questions appear in the center area of the board (for buying property, for instance). Pressing the first letter of a word from the top bar takes that action (Q for Quit as an example). Player stats can be viewed on the screen.","publishedBy":"Leisure Genius","developedBy":"","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, DOS, Tatung Einstein, Thomson MO, Thomson TO, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/monopoly_____","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Leisure Genius","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/130841-monopoly-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/130842-monopoly-msx-screenshot-select-players.png","/images/shots/l/130843-monopoly-msx-screenshot-who-throws-first.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/169678-monopoly-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169679-monopoly-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/169680-monopoly-msx-media.jpg"]}
