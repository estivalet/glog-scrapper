{"name":"Pointless Platform","description":"Just as the name this is a rather pointless platform game. Your goal is simply to jump from platform to platform, higher and higher. There are no enemies, apart from gravity itself. You will need to plan your path, or you could end up in a spot where there are no adjacent platforms to jump to. For each jump you do, you receive 100 points, and additional points just by walking around on the platform. Since the playfield is randomly generated each time you start, this is a game you will never tire of (?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePointless Platform was coded for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.","publishedBy":"The New Image","developedBy":"The New Image","released":"Dec 31, 2006","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/pointless-platform","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"The New Image","developer":"The New Image","ported":"","country":" Worldwide","releaseDate":"Dec 31, 2006","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/204244-pointless-platform-msx-screenshot-tni-presents.png","/images/shots/l/204245-pointless-platform-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/204246-pointless-platform-msx-screenshot-you-start-out-at-the-bottom.png","/images/shots/l/204247-pointless-platform-msx-screenshot-jumping-higher.png","/images/shots/l/204248-pointless-platform-msx-screenshot-and-higher.png","/images/shots/l/204249-pointless-platform-msx-screenshot-i-slipped.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/77735-pointless-platform-msx-front-cover.png"]}
