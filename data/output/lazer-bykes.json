{"name":"Lazer Bykes","description":"This is one of those \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dTron-Style+Games\"\u003eTron-style\u003c/a\u003e games where you and an opponent, either human or computer-controled, ride light cycles in an arena. This is very much like a \u0026quot;snake\u0026quot; game, but where the tail never ends, forcing you to go on as long as possible, trying to trap your opponent with your \u0026quot;tail\u0026quot;. This particular version is played until either version has died ten times, has optional obstacles and two speeds.","publishedBy":"Personal Software Services","developedBy":"","released":"1985","alsoFor":"ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/lazer-bykes","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Personal Software Services","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1985","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/216787-lazer-bykes-msx-screenshot-instructions.png","/images/shots/l/216788-lazer-bykes-msx-screenshot-main-menu.png","/images/shots/l/216789-lazer-bykes-msx-screenshot-two-opposing-bykes.png","/images/shots/l/216790-lazer-bykes-msx-screenshot-green-crashes-into-himself.png","/images/shots/l/216792-lazer-bykes-msx-screenshot-playing-with-obstacles-turned-on.png","/images/shots/l/216793-lazer-bykes-msx-screenshot-crashing-again.png","/images/shots/l/216794-lazer-bykes-msx-screenshot-left-side-wins.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/83762-lazer-bykes-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/83764-lazer-bykes-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/83763-lazer-bykes-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/83765-lazer-bykes-msx-media.jpg"]}
