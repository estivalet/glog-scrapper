The player chooses menu commands (\u0026quot;Look\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Talk\u0026quot;, etc.) that are displayed under a still picture that represents the location. Most of these command have their own context-dependent sub-menus, i.e. it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to look at different things and talk about different topics. There are no puzzles, and the story usually advances when the player has triggered a necessary conversation or event.","publishedBy":"Enix Corporation","developedBy":"","released":"1989","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/angelus-akuma-no-fukuin","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Enix Corporation","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
