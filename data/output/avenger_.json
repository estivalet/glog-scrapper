{"name":"Avenger","description":"In the sequel to \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dWay+of+the+Tiger\"\u003eThe Way of the Tiger\u003c/a\u003e, Yaemon the Grand Master of Flame is the villain of the piece. He has killed your foster-father Naijish and stolen the Scrolls of Kettsuin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour quest to recover the scroll and avenge your father\u0027s death is viewed from above and superficially resembles \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dGauntlet\"\u003eGauntlet\u003c/a\u003e. You start outside the  Quench Heart Keep, and must initially find enough keys in the grounds and connected buildings to penetrate it, and then kill each of the 3 guards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are other prey including spiders to fend off - these know how to home in on you. You are armed with a limited number of Shuikch to shoot from distance; after these are gone you are reliant on your bare hand, although more can be collected. Pressing the 1 key summons an energy recharge from the God Kwon, but only a limited number of times.","publishedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developedBy":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","released":"1986","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Thomson MO, Thomson TO, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/avenger_","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software Limited","ported":"","country":" Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"5 013658 013112","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131250-avenger-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131251-avenger-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131252-avenger-msx-screenshot-level-1.png","/images/shots/l/131253-avenger-msx-screenshot-enemies.png","/images/shots/l/135552-avenger-msx-screenshot-picked-up-a-special-item.png","/images/shots/l/135553-avenger-msx-screenshot-a-bridge-to-cross.png","/images/shots/l/135554-avenger-msx-screenshot-defeated-an-enemy-and-picked-up-all.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/118591-avenger-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/118590-avenger-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/188366-avenger-msx-media.jpg"]}
