{"name":"Mai","description":"Mai is a little girl with cat ears who studies the art of magic. Unfortunately, she doesn\u0027t always do her homework, and sometimes loses control of her magical powers.

Now the poor girl is being hunted down by male and female students, teachers, and other people, and she has to fight for her life while perfecting her magic-casting skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eMai\u003c/i\u003e is similar to the better-known \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dMad%c5%8d+Monogatari\"\u003eMad≈?
