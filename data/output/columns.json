{"name":"Columns","description":"\u003ci\u003eColumns\u003c/i\u003e is loosely derived from \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dTetris\"\u003eTetris\u003c/a\u003e, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up \u0027combos\u0027 - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as the normal game mode, there is also a \u0027flash\u0027 mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.","publishedBy":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","developedBy":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","released":"1990","alsoFor":"Arcade, FM Towns, Game Gear, Genesis, Nintendo 3DS, PC-88, PC-98, SEGA Master System, Sharp X68000, SNES, Sharp Zaurus, TurboGrafx-16, Wii, Windows | Combined View","genre":"Puzzle","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/columns","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","developer":"SEGA Enterprises Ltd.","ported":"Compile","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1990","ean13":"4 988624 920293","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/142218-columns-msx-screenshot-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/142219-columns-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/142220-columns-msx-screenshot-game-options.png","/images/shots/l/142221-columns-msx-screenshot-level-difficulty.png","/images/shots/l/142222-columns-msx-screenshot-game-start.png","/images/shots/l/142223-columns-msx-screenshot-form-groups-of-the-same-color.png","/images/shots/l/142224-columns-msx-screenshot-groups-can-be-formed-horizontal-diagonal.png","/images/shots/l/142225-columns-msx-screenshot-the-brown-gems-dissapear.png","/images/shots/l/142226-columns-msx-screenshot-put-the-next-blocks-with-the-blue-stones.png","/images/shots/l/142227-columns-msx-screenshot-do-here-the-same-with-the-orange-colored.png","/images/shots/l/142228-columns-msx-screenshot-high-scores.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/80237-columns-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/80238-columns-msx-back-cover.jpg"]}
