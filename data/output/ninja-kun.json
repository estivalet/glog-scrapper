{"name":"Ninja-kun","description":"\u003ci\u003eNinja-kun\u003c/i\u003e is a simple game featuring a ninja, plenty of treasures and patrolling guards. The player controls the ninja by either moving left or right. Upon reaching the end of a horizontal plane, the ninja ascends to the next. When the player is successful in maneuvering the ninja through the guards and manages to collect all the treasures by reaching the top, a new level with a different colour palette begins. The ninja has no weapons or abilities. Avoiding the guards is the only way to win, touching the enemy guard means death.","publishedBy":"Micro Cabin Corp.","developedBy":"Micro Cabin Corp.","released":"1983","alsoFor":"PC-88 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/ninja-kun","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Micro Cabin Corp.","developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1983","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/589180-ninja-kun-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/589174-ninja-kun-msx-screenshot-here-we-go.png","/images/shots/l/589175-ninja-kun-msx-screenshot-a-tight-spot.png","/images/shots/l/589176-ninja-kun-msx-screenshot-almost-at-the-end.png","/images/shots/l/589177-ninja-kun-msx-screenshot-success.png","/images/shots/l/589178-ninja-kun-msx-screenshot-oh-no-identical-place-with-different.png","/images/shots/l/589179-ninja-kun-msx-screenshot-this-time-not-so-good.png"],"cover":[]}
