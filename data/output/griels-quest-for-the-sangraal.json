{"name":"Griel\u0027s Quest for the Sangraal","description":"Griel\u0027s Quest for the Sangraal is an MSX1 remake of the old MSX2 puzzle game, \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?game\u003dGriel+no+Seihai\"\u003eGriel no Seihai\u003c/a\u003e by Momonoki House, first published in Peach Up magazine 1990.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay is similar both to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/soko-ban\"\u003eSoukoban\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?gamegroup\u003dAdventures+of+Lolo+Series\"\u003eLolo\u003c/a\u003e games, though the focus is not on moving boxes around. Instead, you are a knight who must pick up magic objects to vanquish evil creatures. The following objects can be found:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMagical Staff â?? Vanquishes RPG slimes.\u003cli\u003eHoly Cross â?? Vanquishes ghosts.\u003cli\u003eSacred Sword â?? Kills ogres.\u003c/ul\u003eOnly one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get rid of an object is to use it against an enemy. Just as in the aforementioned puzzle games, the emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can\u0027t pick up or can\u0027t use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis adaptation was made for the MSXdev \u002705 coding contest.","publishedBy":"Karoshi Corporation","developedBy":"Momonoki House","released":"Dec, 2005","alsoFor":"","genre":"Strategy/Tactics","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/griels-quest-for-the-sangraal","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Karoshi Corporation","developer":"Momonoki House","ported":"Karoshi Corporation","country":" Worldwide","releaseDate":"Dec, 2005","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/182946-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/182947-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-a-game-by-karoshi.png","/images/shots/l/182948-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-in-game-instructions.png","/images/shots/l/182949-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-the-intro-begins.png","/images/shots/l/182950-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-the-enemy.png","/images/shots/l/182951-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-griel-a-blessed.png","/images/shots/l/182952-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-sir-griel-goes.png","/images/shots/l/182953-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-the-first-level.png","/images/shots/l/182955-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-pon-says-the.png","/images/shots/l/182956-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-reached-the.png","/images/shots/l/182957-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-level-2-is-more.png","/images/shots/l/182959-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-one-way-tiles.png","/images/shots/l/182960-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-level-4-requires.png","/images/shots/l/182961-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-made-it-to-the.png","/images/shots/l/182962-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-level-5-isn.png","/images/shots/l/182963-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-screenshot-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/68218-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/68219-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/68220-griel-s-quest-for-the-sangraal-msx-media.jpg"]}
