{"name":"SeaKing","description":"This game is a lot harder then it looks.The player takes off from your aircraft carrier looking for stranded airmen on the rocks. As you set off , you must miss the missiles that come up from the sea, and an enemy aircraft which flies from left to right at random times. When you do get to a stranded airman you release a rope by pressing the fire button or space bar, so that he can climb up to the helicopter. Once he is on board you must fly back to the air craft and drop him off to the ambulance,then do it all over again - there are 25 airmen to collect.","publishedBy":"Players Software","developedBy":"","released":"1986","alsoFor":"","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/seaking","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Players Software","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/449695-seaking-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/449696-seaking-msx-screenshot-starting-out.png","/images/shots/l/449697-seaking-msx-screenshot-i-rescued-a-sailor.png","/images/shots/l/449698-seaking-msx-screenshot-i-have-returned-him-to-the-ship.png","/images/shots/l/449699-seaking-msx-screenshot-the-jet-hit-me.png","/images/shots/l/449700-seaking-msx-screenshot-i-was-hit-by-a-missile.png","/images/shots/l/449701-seaking-msx-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-lives-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/122745-seaking-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/122743-seaking-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/122744-seaking-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/122746-seaking-msx-media.jpg"]}
