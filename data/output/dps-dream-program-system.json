{"name":"D.P.S: Dream Program System","description":"\u003ci\u003eD.P.S\u003c/i\u003e is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named \u003ci\u003eDream Program System\u003c/i\u003e. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe scenarios in this game include:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e A medieval fantasy tale entitled \u003ci\u003ePrincess Fantasy\u003c/i\u003e, in which the player controls a knight who accompanies a princess on a journey. Depending on the personality choice, the knight can either be brave and compassionate, or cynically take advantage of the helpless girl.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003e A typical \u0026quot;naughty doctor\u0026quot; story, in which the player - as either male or female school doctor - has to \u0026quot;examine\u0026quot; young and pretty female patients, trying not to scare them away by employing too direct methods.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003e An encounter between a famous female pop idol and her fan (also female), which leads to a bizarre sexual experience. The player can choose to control the events from the point of view of either the star or the fan.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe gameplay is essentially that of a visual novel. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are \u0026quot;neutral\u0026quot;, having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered \u0026quot;bad\u0026quot; by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.","publishedBy":"Alice Soft","developedBy":"Alice Soft","released":"Apr 15, 1990","alsoFor":"FM Towns, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X68000 | Combined View","genre":"Adventure","perspective":"1st-person","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/dps-dream-program-system","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Alice Soft","developer":"Alice Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"Apr 15, 1990","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
