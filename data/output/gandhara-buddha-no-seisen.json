{"name":"Gandhara: Buddha no Seisen","description":"\u003ci\u003eGandhara\u003c/i\u003e refers to the capital of the Kushan Empire, (today\u0027s Pakistan and Afghanistan), founded in 1st century BC, whose rulers were Buddhists; it was one of the most flourishing Buddhist states in history. The story of the game, however, is based on pure mythology, featuring Buddhist deities in their distinctly Japanese incarnations. The protagonist is contacted by the bodhisattva Akasagarbha (known as KokÅ«zÅ? in Japan, from the Chinese Xukongzang), who tells him that the world is in danger: the king of demons is trying to locate and neutralize the holy Ashes of Buddha, whose power protects the eight worlds. The hero\u0027s task is to find the ashes and defeat whomever the king of demons might send to stop him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of \u003ca href\u003d\"/search/quick?company\u003dEnix\"\u003e Enix\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e works that were unreleased outside of Japan, \u003ci\u003eGandhara\u003c/i\u003e is an action RPG with rather simple gameplay mechanics.

Defeated enemies grant the protagonist experience points; once a certain amount of those is accumulated, the hero levels up and grows stronger.","publishedBy":"Enix Corporation","developedBy":"","released":"1988","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined View","genre":"Action, Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Top-down","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/gandhara-buddha-no-seisen","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Enix Corporation","developer":"","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/506657-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/506656-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-intro.png","/images/shots/l/506658-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-james-receives-his.png","/images/shots/l/506650-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-starting-location.png","/images/shots/l/506651-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-fighting-some-mean.png","/images/shots/l/506652-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-this-is-acala-or.png","/images/shots/l/506653-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-game-over.png","/images/shots/l/506654-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-hmm-the-door-is-locked.png","/images/shots/l/506655-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-screenshot-buddhist-characters.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/327718-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327719-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/327720-gandhara-buddha-no-seisen-msx-media.jpg"]}
