{"name":"Tetris","description":"The original commercially-licensed version of \u003ca href\u003d\"/developer/sheet/view/developerId,533681/\"\u003eAlexey Pajitnov\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s classic Tetris puzzle game.  Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don\u0027t form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.","publishedBy":"Mirrorsoft Ltd.","developedBy":"Elorg","released":"1988","alsoFor":"Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, Apple II, Apple IIgs, Atari ST, BBC Micro, DOS, Electron, Macintosh, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action, Puzzle","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/tetris","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Mirrorsoft Ltd.","developer":"Elorg","ported":"Rowan Software Ltd.","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"5 012342 107106","comments":"MSX1 cassette"}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/200298-tetris-msx-screenshot-msx1-loading-screen.png","/images/shots/l/200299-tetris-msx-screenshot-msx1-choose-your-level.png","/images/shots/l/200300-tetris-msx-screenshot-msx1-so-this-is-that-russian-game-i.png","/images/shots/l/200301-tetris-msx-screenshot-msx1-game-over.png","/images/shots/l/200302-tetris-msx-screenshot-msx1-i-made-the-top-list.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/126071-tetris-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/126070-tetris-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/126069-tetris-msx-media.jpg"]}
