You exit the stage by entering a cave to proceed to the next level. Sometimes there is more than one cave, and you will be warped to another stage other than the next one, depending on what cave you enter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter three or so stages, you enter the game\u0027s Big Mode. The object here is to blast blue and purple spheres before they have a chance to hurt you. Some spheres have power-ups that will increase your firepower. When you have made some distance, you have to defeat the Predator before you can continue on to the next stage. Big Mode is the same throughout the game, but the only difference here is the Predator\u0027s attack pattern.","publishedBy":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","developedBy":"Klon","released":"1988","alsoFor":"NES | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"Licensed","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/predator_","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","developer":"Klon","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1988","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131014-predator-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/131015-predator-msx-screenshot-map-layout.png","/images/shots/l/131016-predator-msx-screenshot-don-t-fall-of-the-cliff.png","/images/shots/l/131017-predator-msx-screenshot-you-need-some-practice-for-these-jumps.png","/images/shots/l/131018-predator-msx-screenshot-disclaimer.png"],"cover":[]}
