{"name":"New Boggle Boggle 2","description":"\u003ci\u003eNew Boggle Boggle 2\u003c/i\u003e looks and plays identically to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/new-boggle-boggle\"\u003eNew Boggle Boggle\u003c/a\u003e. It features 150 stages, most of which are exclusive to it (though some are exact replicas of the previous game\u0027s stages), and a few new types of enemies. Otherwise, the game is indistinguishable from its predecessor.
