{"name":"Adventure Island","description":"In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture Tina and hold her as his own. It\u0027s up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.","publishedBy":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","developedBy":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","released":"1986","alsoFor":"DoJa, Game Boy Advance, J2ME, NES, Wii, Wii U | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/adventure-island","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","developer":"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/131021-adventure-island-msx-screenshot-run-wonder-boy.png","/images/shots/l/131022-adventure-island-msx-screenshot-collect-the-egg-and-the-gold.png","/images/shots/l/131023-adventure-island-msx-screenshot-title-screen.png","/images/shots/l/511142-adventure-island-msx-screenshot-proper-copyrights.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/328111-adventure-island-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/328110-adventure-island-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/328109-adventure-island-msx-media.jpg"]}
