{"name":"Tritorn","description":"Everything was peaceful on the island of Rwanda, until the evil demon lord Pay Valusa invaded it, sending hordes of monsters to do his bidding. A lone warrior named Tritorn is the only one who can defeat the demon and restore peace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eTritorn\u003c/i\u003e is, together with \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/dragon-slayer\"\u003eDragon Slayer\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/hydlide\"\u003eHydlide\u003c/a\u003e, an early progenitor of the action role-playing genre. Similarly to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii\"\u003eXanadu\u003c/a\u003e, exploration is performed from a side view, with jumping and vertical areas, but no true platforming. Unlike the aforementioned games, it is necessary to press the action key to hit enemies rather than simply \u0026quot;bumping\u0026quot; into them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay system is very simple, having no weapon or equipment management, monetary system, or friendly areas. The protagonist either attacks enemies with his sword or throws magic balls at them, which come in limited supply. Experience points are awarded for slaying enemies; though there is no clear indicator as to when the player character levels up, he gradually becomes stronger, tougher, and learns new abilities (e.g. walking faster).","publishedBy":"Sein-Soft","developedBy":"Sein-Soft","released":"1986","alsoFor":"FM-7, PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined View","genre":"Action, Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED], Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/tritorn","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Sein-Soft","developer":"Sein-Soft","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
