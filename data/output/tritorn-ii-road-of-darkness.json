{"name":"Tritorn II: Road of Darkness","description":"Once again, demons are threatening the peaceful existence of the human kind. The evil Geld is sending his army to conquer human lands. Legend says that the ancient city of Seram harbors a mysterious jewel that is needed to defeat Geld. But who is brave enough to venture there and retrieve it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe follow-up to \u003ca href\u003d\"/game/tritorn\"\u003eTritorn\u003c/a\u003e is, like its predecessor, an action role-playing game. It expands upon the previous game by adding friendly areas (towns), monetary system, shops that sell items, magic spells, weapons, and armor, and non-player characters to interact with. The player takes the roles of various adventurers belonging to different classes; they are, however, controlled very similarly, with a single button assigned to attack. It is also possible to jump and climb ladders, though there are no true platforming elements in the game. Experience points and money are awarded for defeating enemies.","publishedBy":"Xain","developedBy":"Xain","released":"1989","alsoFor":"PC-88, PC-98, Sharp X1 | Combined View","genre":"Action, Role-Playing (RPG)","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/tritorn-ii-road-of-darkness","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Xain","developer":"Xain","ported":"","country":" Japan","releaseDate":"1989","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
