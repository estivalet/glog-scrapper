{"name":"Falcon Patrol","description":"\u003ci\u003eFalcon Patrol\u003c/i\u003e is a two-way side-scrolling shooter. Players fly a jet across a looping area and must shoot down attacking aircraft. A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies\u0027 position. Fuel and rockets are limited, but there are several landing platforms where the jet can be refueled and resupplied. Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them. As the game progresses, enemies attack in increasingly large and difficult waves.","publishedBy":"Bug-Byte Software Ltd.","developedBy":"","released":"1986","alsoFor":"BBC Micro, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, Electron, VIC-20 | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"Side view","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/falcon-patrol","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Bug-Byte Software Ltd.","developer":"","ported":"","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1986","ean13":"","comments":""}]}],"shot":[],"cover":[]}
