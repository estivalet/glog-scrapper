{"name":"Streaker","description":"You are a streaker with not a stitch on you, in the streets. As you go from room to room you must try and collect as much of your clothing as possible; the more clothes you find the more areas of the game you can go to. You can pick items up such as food to keep your energy up; some shops will only open at different times to make things difficult. Be quick to find your clothes or they can get pinched.","publishedBy":"Bulldog Software","developedBy":"","released":"1987","alsoFor":"Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum | Combined View","genre":"Action","perspective":"3rd-person [DEPRECATED]","theme":"","nonSport":"","sport":"","misc":"","country":"","releaseDate":"","url":"http://www.mobygames.com//game/msx/streaker","system":"msx","release":[{"system":"MSX","releases":[{"publisher":"Bulldog Software","developer":"","ported":"Beach Nut Creative Software","country":" United Kingdom","releaseDate":"1987","ean13":"5 012967 700706","comments":""}]}],"shot":["/images/shots/l/440918-streaker-msx-screenshot-title-screen-and-starting-location.png","/images/shots/l/440920-streaker-msx-screenshot-i-am-in-a-shop.png","/images/shots/l/440921-streaker-msx-screenshot-they-won-t-let-me-in-as-i-am-not-dressed.png","/images/shots/l/440922-streaker-msx-screenshot-i-lost-my-last-life-game-over.png"],"cover":["/images/covers/l/119481-streaker-msx-front-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/119482-streaker-msx-inside-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/119480-streaker-msx-back-cover.jpg","/images/covers/l/120627-streaker-msx-media.jpg"]}
