  "note": "On this single-sided disc (yes, VG8235 users) some drawings and digitisations on screen 8, so only for MSX 2 and MSX 2+.\nThe beautiful graphical antics range from snakes to helicopters, from city scapes to real faces. Really nice pictures for those who wanted to see some screen art or perhaps try for yourself what you can make of such images in a drawing program. Nice interlace submissions are welcome.",
