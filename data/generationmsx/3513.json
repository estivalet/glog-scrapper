  "note": "Note that the title screenshot is actually the title of the font editor that comes with it. The 2nd screenshot is of the titler program.\n\nFrom page 3 of the manual:\n\nThe Anglosoft Software / Memory Video \u0026quot;Video titler and display program\u0026quot; has been designed as a cost-effective system for use on any MSX computer, which enables the user to create a sequence of screen displays (referred to as \u0027pages\u0027).\n\nA sequence is created by typing a number of lines onto the first page, selecting how the page will be displayed (wipe used t o bring the page on etc.), selecting how each line of the page will be displayed (character size etc.) and then moving on tho the next page, and so on until all the pages have been created.\n\nOnce the pages that make up your sequence have been created, the sequence can be \u0027run\u0027 - each page will then appear on the screen in order, i.e. the first page will appear in the style chosen and will remain on the screen for the selected amount of time, this page will then be removed and replaced by the second page, and so on until the sequence is completed and all of the pages have been displayed.\n\nThis sequence of pages can then be put onto video tape as titles.\nIf the program is used with a Pioneer PX7 computer, or any other MSX computer with a super-imposition facility, these titles can be superimposed over the video images.\n\nAlternatively, the program can be used to produce attractive and effective shop window displays on a T.V. or monitor.\nA sequence can be displayed in a loop thus enabling continuous overnight window displays to be produced.",
