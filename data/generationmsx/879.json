  "note": "Here\u0027s a text that comes with a download of it:\n\nA amateur programmer makes a great game which a game company could not make. This game is one of them. The rule and the system of program had an important effect upon many people. Author of this game is YUKI who makes a lot of strange original games like this. \nThe program list of this was published on a magazine \u0027Program Pochette\u0027 from TOKUMA SHOTEN. After then, this game remaked as ARCADE GAME , FAMICON SOFT (by IREM CORP.) and software for personal computer (by TOKUMA SHOTEN INTERMEDIA)\n\nYou can let a blue hand move. A red hand cling your blue hand, so you should know that you make a way of red hand. When you push a SPACE KEY, you can change contents between rooms which a blue hand and a red hand point at. Your mission is that drop many balls in higher-area. Walls sometimes break or repair, so you would let balls drop in higher-area continuity if you manage it successfully. But once you drop a ball in OVER erea, the game will over.",
