  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina.htm:\n\nAnother game that was officially available only on the MSX2. Humbly subtitled \u0026quot;The Micro Xevious\u0026quot;, it is based on the arcade version, but of course it can\u0027t do much to imitate that game\u0027s qualities. Like most 8-bit computer ports it got rearranged and stripped of some elements. The technical execution is less than stellar this time, and there\u0027s a fair share of glitches. Worst is the scrolling, which goes stepwise like in Knightmare or The Three Dragon Story. However, while it worked when the player controlled a knight by foot, it just feels wrong in a futuristic shooter, where the plane is supposed to be moving fluently. Two kinds of background music can be selected. \u0026quot;Original\u0026quot; is the same terrible 1-second loop from the arcade version, but \u0026quot;Special\u0026quot; is a neat little melody.",
