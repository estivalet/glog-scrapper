  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina.htm:\n\nNow Taito\u0027s Bobble Bobble was actually officially ported to the MSX, but because of it\u0027s sheer popularity in Korea Zemina tried it with their own version. New Boggle Boggle is a remix with completely new levels, but the execution is all kinds of bad. The dragons get constantly stuck in the environment, enemy behaviour is broken and enemies get free from the bubbles much too fast. There\u0027s also a lot of missing features, like the EXTEND letters and various special items. Worst of all, the music sounds like an elementary school student tried to imitate the melody on a carillon.\n\nNew Boggle Boggle hasn\u0027t been developed by Zemina\u0027s internal developers, but rather a team called MBitM, which should carry on to contribute games published under the Zemina label, until they turned into the PC developer Namu Software.",
