  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-clover.htm:\n\nYet another port, the single plane brawler Vigilante is the only one of Clover\u0027s games that is preserved so far, so it is much better known than the rest. The game features three stages with plenty of enemy types and bosses, but the graphics are pretty bad even for the MSX1. It is also quite unfair, as the supposedly easiest and most common enemy type is extremely dangerous in this version. There\u0027s about one single frame to hit them, or else these mooks strangle the player for a good portion if not all of the life bar.",
