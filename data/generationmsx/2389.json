  "note": "As a user of home-computers you are liable to get confronted with loading\nproblems! Apart from faulty duplication of program masters, most loading\nproblems are caused by maladjustment of the recorder head. When the setting\nis only a few degrees of (figure 1, in the back of this manual) the program\nsignals on the cassette do not or only partially reach your computer. With\nthe Head Alignment Kit you are able to precisely readjust the recorder head.\nThe Head Alignment Kit offers the main program, a special test program and a\nscrewdriver for fine-adjustment. \nOn the A-side of the cassette you will first find the main program-HAK, then\nthe test program-side A. On the B-side you\u0027ll first find the test program\nside B and then the main program-HAK. \n\n\nCLEANING THE RECORDING HEAD\n---------------------------\nBefore you start adjusting the recorder head it is recommended to clean it\nfirst. Press the PLAY-button of your recorder down; the head will appear.\nClean, for instance with a cotton bud dipped in alcohol. \n\nLOADING THE PROGRAM CASSETTE\n----------------------------\nInsert the program cassette (label up) in the recorder. Rewind, then enter:\n \n  RUN\u0026quot;CAS:\u0026quot;  \n\nAfter loading the following will appear on your screen:\n\n1 a counter\n2 side \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; \n3 a bar with one green and one red end, plus an arrow.\n\n\nWHEN THE PROGRAM CASSETTE DOES NOT LOAD\n---------------------------------------\nWhen the recording head is badly adjusted, there is a possibility that even\nthe program cassette will not load. In this case you should place the Kit\u0027s\nscrewdriver carefully in the opening above the REWIND-button were the\nadjustment screw is situated (see figure 2). Be sure to place the\nscrewdriver vertically on the screw (see figure 3). In most cases it is\neasier to press the PLAY-key first; the recorder head and adjustment screw\nwill be just under the opening. Now try to turn the adjustment screw and\nwill be just under the opening. Now try to turn the adjustment screw and\nreload the program. Repeat this, until the correct display appears on the\nmain screen. \n\nNote: Be carelul when using the adjustment screwdriver. Keepedd away from\nmagnetic fields (like in loudspeakers, t.v.). A magnetised screwdriver can\ndamage the recorder head. Pull the screwdriver out of the opening before\npressing any cassette recorder key. \n\n\nADJUSTING THE RECORDING HEAD\n----------------------------\n1. As soon as the main program is loaded you are able to adjust the recorder\nhead. While the cassette is running, carefully insert the screwdriver in the\nopening above the REWIND-button (see former chapter). Turn the screw until\nthe arrow is in the green part ot the bar on your screen. The counter on the\nscreen has to exceed 2000. Turn the screwdriver several times slowly to the\nleft/right until the maximum number is reached. \n2. Remove the screwdriver from the opening. Press . On the screen\na \u0026quot;B\u0026quot; appears. Reverse the cassette, rewind it and press PLAY. Now try to\nget the arrow back in the green area again and allow the counter to reach\nthe highest amount possible. This demands some precision. \n3. Remove the screwdriver. Press on  so that again \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;  appears and\nreverse the cassette back to side \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;. Forward the cassette to the test\nprogram-side A and start the recorder. When the arrow is still on the\ncorrect place, the head is now properly adjusted. \n4. When the arrow has shifted, repeat the steps from 2. Always press\n before reversing the cassette. And again, for best result it is\nimportant that the counter has the highest read- out possible. \nNote 1: There is no signal on the header tape of the cassette!\nNote 2: The test program side A is for \u0026quot;global\u0026quot; adjustment, side B for\nfine-tuning, where after the test program side A is used for final control.",
