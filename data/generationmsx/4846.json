  "note": "Reader Michel Shuqair sent us this wonderful program. This makes it possible to sample sounds from the Music Module and play them on the FM-PAC. Playing them back on the Music module is also possible. A very professional piece of software with extensive examples for use in Basic and a complete manual. With the Music Module it is possible to sample at 16 kHz level, the quality of a good tape. Because of the good routines the quality of the FM-PAC is also very acceptable, the samples can be played at different speeds and pre-defined points can be started and stopped. The only reason we can offer this as PD, is that there will soon be an extended version of the FM Sampler which will be sold commercially.The FM Sampler is delivered on a single-sided disk and requires a music module. Recommended!",
