  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina.htm:\n\nZemina\u0027s first game is basically Mario Bros. The sprites are all redrawn and the characters renamed, so Titan is conquering the sewer with his brother Gamma. All the enemy types, levels and bonus rounds are in, but flickering is even worse than on the NES. Mario\u0027s trademark skidding is missing in this version, which makes it somewhat more playable, but physics behaviour is a little odd, to say the least. The best thing about this version is that music is played during the levels, where Mario Bros was rather silent.",
