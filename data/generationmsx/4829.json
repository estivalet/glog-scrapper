  "note": "This disk, MSX public-domain number 11, a disc totally filled with programs of father and son Hardeman. A number of programs was already published on disk number 9, but are now put into a new (MSX 2) loader jacket.\nElgawas, car expenses, mortgage and vaslas are now msx-2 version on this disc. Both father Gert and son Martijn created together a user-friendly database that does exactly what it ought to do: store data.\nSpatiewisser (space eraser) and data finder (datazoeker) are indispensable tools for the seasoned Basic Programmer and can save a lot of time and memory space. More playful things like treasure hunts, a text adventure and the famous quiz, however, can also be found on the Hardeman-disk.\n\nNote: On the Double Millennium CD, Disk B11 contains \u0026quot;Play with me\u0026quot; (B10). This may be a mistake on the Millennium CD.",
