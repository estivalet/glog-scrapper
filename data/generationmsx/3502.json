  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-clover.htm:\n\nThis game is very mysterious. It is only known through old advertisements by Clover (it is confirmed that it was released, though), and there doesn\u0027t seem to be any previous game with the same title this could be a port of. Hello Kangshi is actually the title of a series of kid\u0027s horror/martial arts movies from Hong Kong (Haalo Goengsi in Cantonese), so it could be the port of a really obscure chinese game. However, the series was also very popular in Korea, so it might as well be an original game, or just a renamed Japanese game to cash in with the name.",
