  "note": "The disk this time is from a known quantity. After already having published two of this previous diskettes Laurens Rutten send a letter asking why we could not even publish his double-sided version of the Starcom demo. More pictures and therefore and even more fun graphic for the screen fanatics. Here you go Laurens, Starcom plus comes as disc number 19. Granted, it\u0027s a very nice graphical disk worth watching. The digitisations are of a high level, the screen transitions are programmed nicely. As a whole it runs smoothly and looks neat.\nPlease remember that this is a double-sided floppy disk? So much graphical information can unfortunately not be to crammed onto a single-sided floppy disk.",
