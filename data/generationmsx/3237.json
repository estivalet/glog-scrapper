  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-aproman.htm:\n\nThe platformer with the funny name uses sprites from Choro Q, but it is a completely different game. The player car constantly drives at high speed and never brakes nor stops, the only ways to maneuver are changing direction and jump. The journey goes over rivers and skyscraper rooftops, an explanation what business a car with a propeller on top has got there is missing. Collision detection is very asinine, and after dying, the game likes to respawn the car just above another deadly gap.\n\nThere are three stages, each has its own enemy type in addition to the omnipresent skulls: Construction cars at the beginning, cuttlefish in the second stage, and finally helicopters. After all three stages, the sequence just repeats over and over again.",
