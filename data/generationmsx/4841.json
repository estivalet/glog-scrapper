  "note": "Again a different angle. This time the previous government is the subject, namely in terms of privacy of those involved.\nA number of leading figures from the previous government have been established by an avid artist in a number of caricatures. Or, for those who have never encountered this word before: characteristic stamps. These stamps can be read into a program like for example Dynamic Publisher, but in addition, there is a Basic program provided in which these fine prints can be displayed, one by one, in a kind of carousel. As a bonus, there are also something well-known personalities immortalized for posterity on this disc.\nReagan, Bush, Gorbachev, Thatcher, Martens, you name it, all have been given the space necessary for their image.\nThis disc is only MSX-2.",
