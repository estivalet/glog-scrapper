You cannot return to Earth, because your hyper space engine is gone, radio is broken and memory crystal turned to dust. But the rest of equipment is fine. So you can travel in the current galaxy, land on planets and talk to their inhabitants using your ships computer. People on Earth hope that you are alive and that they can receive a signal from you. Good Luck!\n\nControls screen translation:\n\nCursor [LEFT] [RIGHT] - change course during flight. Turn after landing.\n\nCursor [UP] - Increase hyper speed, hyper-jump, take off.\n\nCursor [DOWN] - Reduce speed, Landing, Agree to exchange.\n\n[SPACE] or [GRAPH] + [RIGHT], [LEFT], [UP], [DOWN] - contact with objects after they appear in the direct sight zone.\n\n[STOP] - Pause Game\n\n[ESC] - Game Over",
