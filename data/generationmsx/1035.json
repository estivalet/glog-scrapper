  "note": "This game required a bit of detective\u0027s work to get any information on its origin. It was only released in Japan by Carry laboratories, which is the only company credited in the code. Return of Jelda would have kept being known only as a Carry game if it weren\u0027t for a tiny casual mention in the weekly business magazine The Econo File (The Econo File, September 25th, 1987, page 137). Focused on SunA\u0027s first self developed arcade game, the article goes on name-dropping a few more active developers, including Softmen. The team is stated as having finished a contract with Carry for a game \u0026quot;Jelda\u0026quot;.\n\nSource: http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-softmen.htm",
