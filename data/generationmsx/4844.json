  "note": "What does the title of a Dutch song have to do with a Public Domain disk? Simple, because on this single-sided disc there are a number of drawings and digitisations. Of mountains to be understood, and those are usually very high, especially if one of those mountains is Mount Everest. There are also a few interesting pictures of birds, both digitized and drawn. If you need some intellectual help in these dark times, Albert Einstein is in digital form ready for you. If he will be able to answer you questions, I have my doubts, but it\u0027s worth a try. Also this disc is completely designed for screen 8 and therefore only works with MSX-2 and MSX-2+.",
