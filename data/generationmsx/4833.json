  "note": "In this Public Domain disk number 14 sometimes completely different. Robert Heerekop - an active radio amateur - has written a program in his spare time with which one can \u0026quot;telex\u0026quot; according to the RTTY protocol.\nThis program can be used to intercept telex messages from press agencies and decode them. With the help of a small concatenation of electronic components, cost of ten guilders maximum - it is possible to realize the whole.\nYour librarian has been kind enough to type in the complete manual including the connections of the RTTY converter. It\u0027s actually a wonderful program. For prying eyes is it possible\nto instantly receive the latest news in the living room.\nNeeded: RTTY converter receiver (and transmitter) and a little patience.",
