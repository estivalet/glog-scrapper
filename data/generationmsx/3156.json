  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina.htm:\n\nThe third part in Zemina\u0027s only long-running series. One would expect half of Super Mario Bros 3 cloned, but only Mario\u0027s sprite and few others are ripped from that game. Everything else is redrawn, though mostly stolen from Super Mario World. This makes for some awkward elements, like diagonal pipes realized as stairs.\n\nThe game consists of 16 levels, which equals the number in both previous Super Boy games, but this time, they\u0027re entirely new. At the end of every level awaits a Hammer Brother, the final boss is the fat one from SMB3. Mario\u0027s(?) walking speed is extraordinarily slow, but even running he\u0027s not really fast. Extras are limited to those that are in since the first game. Quite everything looks like how the next Super Mario game would have turned out if Miyamoto wouldn\u0027t have had any more ideas. Seeing how almost everything in the game is newly pixeled, one cannot help but wonder why they didn\u0027t just create their own characters to begin with. Was the developer really so unimaginative? Other games by Zemina like Cyborg Z suggest differently.\n\nIn other news, the hero of the series finally gets to rescue his first princess in the short ending.",
