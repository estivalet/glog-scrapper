  "note": "From the web site of one of the authors, Steve Wallis (http://www.socialiststeve.me.uk/games.htm): \n\nGet past the alien fleet (shooting as many of the spaceships you feel like) and dock with your starship. Sean wrote this game (with me providing the BASIC compiler and Z-80 assembly language code, and porting it to the MSX platform) and   obviously deliberately   named it after the very left-wing future of the galaxy at the end of Isaac Asimovs Foundation series to undermine that series by associating the ending with violence towards aliens. I discovered much later the reason that he had been able to get away with this  he read Foundations Edge (which introduced the term Galaxia) before me, unlike Isaacs other books which I bought, because he received that book as a prize for doing well at school.  He did this because he was and still is (partly at least) on the side of big business in the conspiratorial organisations underneath the surface of society. I have since reused Galaxia as the name of a revolutionary socialist band.",
