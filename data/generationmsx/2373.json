  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina.htm:\n\nAfter the overwhelming success of Tetris on the Game Boy, everyone and the cat ripped it off with their own version, so it was only a matter of time when Flashpoint would come about. The game is a direct adaption of Sega\u0027s 1989 arcade Tetris clone with the same title. In 90 stages the player has do delete special bomb stones in order to detonate the stage. As in the original Tetris, the blocks get consecutively faster, but their speed level can be toned down again by clearing stages fast.\n\nAs any stage ends when the bombs are out of the way, some stages that seem to be incredible hard by standard Tetris rules turn out ridiculously easy. A lot of the stages form images or characters.",
