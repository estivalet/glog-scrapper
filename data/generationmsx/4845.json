  "note": "Even more pictures, you might think? Quite accurate, but with such a load of beautiful graphics I have also got to let our loyal readers have some enjoyment? On this disk number 22 again are some pictures that were created on screen 8. For the loyal users, of for example, a VG8235 we have again elected for a single-sided disk. The pictures that I had to remove from the disc, I still owe you. The somewhat futuristic title refers to one of the above images, the launch of a space shuttle on the diskette. Furthermore, there are on the disc digital realizations including that of a sunset - and other rural scenes. Further also Harrison Ford stares at you in one of the picture, digitized from a movie poster.",
