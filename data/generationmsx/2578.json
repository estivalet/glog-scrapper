Squares indicate enemy \nspace stations. \nWarp: Hold the vibrating sight above the static computer navigator in order to warp to \nthe correct quadrant in space.\nRefueling: Once at the refueling station, automatic computer control takes over and gives\nyou a little breather.\nMeteorites: Fire your laser (fire button or space bar), using cursor\nkeys or joystick to aim your sight. If a meteorite hits your vessel your\ndefence shield is weakened. Should your shield be nulified completely\nand any new impact is sustained, Starfighter will be terminated, ending\nyour mission.\nFighters: Wipe out the Urnuth fighters in the same way you blasted the\nmeteorites. But be careful: they fire back!\nSecret code: Decipher the encrypted sequence of digits to crack the\ncode. Mode your cursor keys or joystick up or down to increment or\ndecrement digits, and left or right for next digit. The higher your\nCRO-display is, the closer to the correct entry code you are. When\ncountdown reaches zero, one of the three sabotage crew is lost. If at\nany time all members are lost, your quest is over.\n\n\n\nSpeedboat Racer\n---------------\nObject of the game: Cover the section, which is outlined with 2 buoys on\na lake, as fast as you can. Pay attention to the strength and direction\nof the wind, you can read this on the \u0026quot;WIND\u0026quot; indicator; when you sail at\nhigh speed you take the risk of flying up in the air. Also reckon with\nthe wash of the waves, visible on the \u0026quot;WATER\u0026quot; indicator; adjust your\nspeed if necessary. Avoid crashes with competitors.\nJoystick/cursor keys: Left \u003d left, Right \u003d right, Upwards \u003d accelerate,\nDownwards \u003d brake.\n\n\n\nOh Shit!\n--------\nControls: Joystick controls correspond with cursor key controls.\nLeft \u003d left, Right \u003d right, Up \u003d up, Down \u003d down.\nThe one and only arcade game classic. Run, run run... for the ghosts.\nEat, eat, eat... the vitamins you find in the labyrinth, as you gobble\nyour way through the maze faster, faster and... OH SHIT!!! Music and\nspeech add to the enjoyment!\n\n\n\nThe Heist\n---------\nControls: During the game you can make use of the following keys:\n\u0026lt;M\u0026gt; music on/off\n\u0026lt;S\u0026gt; sound on/off\n\u0026lt;R\u0026gt; start game again\nTo get onto the escalator press the cursor \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;up\u0026quot; \nsimultaneously. By using the elevator you can also change from one floor\nto the next. Place Graham in the elevator and press \u0026lt;1\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;2\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;3\u0026gt;.\n\n\n\nSpy Story\n---------\nControls: Determine the direction you want to go, using the following\nkeys:\n\u0026lt;N\u0026gt; \u003d North\n\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; \u003d East\n\u0026lt;S\u0026gt; \u003d South\n\u0026lt;W\u0026gt; \u003d West\nIn addition the program will respond to the following commands:\nINV  \u003d Inventory, to see which objects you are carrying with you.\nLOOK \u003d To take a close look at various situations.\nHELP \u003d Will provide you with helpful hints.\nSTOP \u003d to quit or to pause.\nAfter you enter \u0026quot;STOP\u0026quot;, the program will ask you if you want to save the\nadventure so far: \u0026lt;Y\u0026gt; \u003d YES\nHit any other key, if you do not want to save.\nNOTE: Do not forget to give \u0026lt;RETURN\u0026gt; after each text or command you\nentered.\n\n\n\nTape 2   A: Beach Head, MuSiX\n         B: Skooter, Mazes Unlimited, Hard Boiled\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeach Head\n----------\nOption Menu: Options can be selected only by using space-bar and cursor\nkeys.

Top left: the secret passage, flashing white. Top right:\nthe main channel. If we move to engage the enemy head-on, move the fleet\n-the four white dots at the top- directly through the main channel, in\nthe direction of the flashing beach. Howeverm we can also opt for a\nsurprise attack: manoeuver your fleet to the secret passage. The\nadvantage of this tactic is that the enemy will be caught off-guard. The\ndisadvantage: the passage is studded with mines and automatically\nlaunched torpedoes.\n\n\n\nMuSiX\n-----\nPlay\n\u0026lt;STOP\u0026gt; \u003d Switch between play and edit mode\nUp     \u003d play faster\nDown   \u003d play slower\nRight  \u003d play louder\nLeft   \u003d play softer\n\nEdit\nLeft   \u003d move keyboard pointer left\nRight  \u003d move keyboard pointer right\n\nMoving through Memory\nUp           \u003d move up\nDown         \u003d move down\n\u0026lt;HOME\u0026gt;       \u003d to start\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;Up   \u003d move up, fast\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;Down \u003d move down, fast\n\u0026lt;STOP\u0026gt;       \u003d play backwards\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;Y    \u003d synchronise stepping\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;U    \u003d undo synchronisation\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;E    \u003d last melody note \u003d end of memory\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;.    \u003d Green lines \u003d end of memory\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;R    \u003d reserve all of memory\n\nMaking changes\n\u0026lt;INS\u0026gt;         \u003d insert note pointed at\n\u0026lt;DEL\u0026gt;         \u003d delete note pointed at\n\u0026lt;CTRL\u0026gt;\u0026lt;DEL\u0026gt;   \u003d delete all notes between lines\n\u0026lt;ESC\u0026gt;         \u003d delete melody between lines\n\u0026lt;BS\u0026gt;          \u003d delete drum between lines\n\u0026lt;CTRL\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ESC\u0026gt;   \u003d delete rest of melody\n\u0026lt;CTRL\u0026gt;\u0026lt;BS\u0026gt;    \u003d delete rest of drumsounds\n\u0026lt;CTRL\u0026gt;\u0026lt;HOME\u0026gt;  \u003d delete rest of music\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;\u0026lt;INS\u0026gt; \u003d make room by shifting upwards\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;\u0026lt;DEL\u0026gt; \u003d delete forwards by shifting\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;\u0026lt;BS\u0026gt;  \u003d delete backwards by shifting\n\u0026lt;F1\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;F10\u0026gt; \u003d insert prefixed rhytms\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;X     \u003d transpose\n\nKeyboard feature\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;KB      \u003d activate keyboard feature\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;K       \u003d deactivate keyboard\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ESC\u0026gt;   \u003d set keyboard 2 octaves higher\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;\u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt;   \u003d set keyboard 1 octave higher\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;\u0026lt;CTRL\u0026gt;  \u003d set keyboard 1 octave lower\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;\u0026lt;SHIFT\u0026gt; \u003d set keyboard 2 octaves lower\n\nSubdivision\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;n (n\u003d\u0026lt;2\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;3\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;9\u0026gt;)\n          \u003d multiply subdivision by n.\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;0 \u003d undo subdivision\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;1 \u003d invert background colour\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;+ \u003d add 1 to subdivisor\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;- \u003d substract 1 from subdivisor\n\nLoading and saving\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;L \u003d load music file from tape\n\u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;S \u003d save music file to tape\n\n\n\nMazes Unlimited\n---------------\nControls: Cursor keys correspond with joystick movements.
