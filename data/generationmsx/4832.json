  "note": "After a previous disc of Laurens Rutten, namely \u0026quot;Star Wars\u0026quot; with a series of pretty pictures, Laurens has yet another one.\nThis time the television series \u0026quot;Starcom\u0026quot; became object of his digitization antics.\nIt looks just like the previous disc, beautiful and makes us in MSX country at least believe that Amiga is not always everything. Next time: \u0026quot;Dallas\u0026quot;?",
