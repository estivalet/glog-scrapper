  "note": "Manual:\n\nNow..... How does Battle Bomber work?\n\nWel it\u0027s simple. You controll a bomberman. You can play with two or three\nplayers. And the aim of the game is to kill your fellow opponents.\n\nTo do this you can lay bombs. The number of bombs you can lay can be \ncontrolled from the starting screen or during a game you can obtain a\nbomb option which increases the number of bombs.\n\nAfter a while a bomb explodes. The reach of the other explosions can\nbe broadened by obtaining a flame. This way you can set the whole\nscreen alight!\n\nAbove the screen the computer keeps score. When you are the only won\n(I mean one offcourse (joke!)) left you score is incremented. \nWhen you\u0027ve reached a certain amount, you\u0027ve won the game.\nThings such as this amount can be selected in the intro screen by \nmoving up and down and to left and right. \n\nWhen all players die simultaniously we declare a draw!\n\nIn the intro screen you can load the extra levels by setting the\nbomberhead on levels and going to left and right. When you see\na level you want to play press space or firebutton. The level will then\nbe loaded.\n\nTo start the game go to start and press fire or space.",
