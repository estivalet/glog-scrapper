  "note": "The Public Domain disk number 12 is once again a complete demo.\nThis time of the game \u0026quot;Penguin Adventure\u0026quot; by the BCF (the \u0027Best Crackers Federation). They made a nice demo with the locations of the different warps and crevices. Also from the menu there is a crevice with the famous one-armed bandit. In addition on this disk some  entertainment, with both a small penguin as a giant among the penguins. Cute disk for the\npassionate \u0026quot;Penguiners\u0026quot;. And do not think that it is easy to keep apart the Dutch and English spelling of that bird!",
