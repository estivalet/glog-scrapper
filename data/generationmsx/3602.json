  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-open.htm:\n\nOpen\u0027s first game was most likely the finished version of Zemina\u0027s unreleased game Wonsiin 2, judging by the theme and the time of its release. The game (the Sega Master System version) is described as a Wonder Boy clone and has been criticized for lacking in its technical execution, especially the scrolling (which means that this is most likely another plain conversion from the MSX code).\n\nThe Korean cartridge hasn\u0027t surfaced in recent times so far, but the game was included on HES\u0027 4 Pak as Adventure Kid. It was previously featured on Innovation Technology\u0027s ad, but shared the fate of all localizations announced by Innovation.",
