  "note": "On this again fifteenth MSX disk are three games of Michel Shuqait from Lelystad, a contributor in the EuroSoft / MCM programming contest.\n\nFight in Space, a very nice MSX 1 game in which the aim is to defend the planet Zirta. Graphic are not so beautiful, but very difficult and full of action.\n\nMission Alpha, MSX 2 intro but also runs on MSX 1, looks graphically very smart. You drive a tank and shoot you way through a number of large, difficult fields. If you see the \u0026quot;Game Over\u0026quot; message with trembling hands and teary eyes you will wonder why real wars are still fought. Recommended!\n\nFreaky, MSX-2, you only have one goal: to walk to the end. Surely it would all be very easy, if not of those blocks that are in the way, and stripess which you have to get over it. And then also those life-threatening stripes that causes your energy rod to slowly but surely disappear. Graphically really nice and great to play.",
