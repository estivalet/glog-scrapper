  "note": "Note: it seems that Manuscript was also released separately, but we\u0027re not sure about that. See the separate entry of Manuscript, where you can also see screenshots of it.\n\nFrom the manual:\n\nThe PRINT-X-PRESS system is a suite of three programs; DESIGNER, COMPILER and MANUSCRIPT. All three programs can be used as \u0027Stand alone\u0027 programs or used together as a very flexible colour desktop publishing and printing system.\nThe principle program in the suite is MANUSCRIPT - this program enables documents (called manuscripts) to be designed using any of the character shapes contained in the character set that is resident in memory.\nTo design a manuscript you simply insert these characters onto the manuscript - the size of the manuscript being selectable. This can then be printed - the resulting printout being exactly as displayed on the screen.\n\nDifferent character sets can be loaded into MANUSCRIPT from tape or disc - these are called files. The character set that you use when designing a manuscript depends on what type of manuscript you wish to print, i.e. if you wish to produce Christmas cards you should load a file that contains graphics character shapes  such as Christmas trees, stockings etc.\n\nNow, there is where the flexibility of the system becomes apparent:\nThe COMPILER program enables you to build a suitable character set from any characters in the library for use on the particular manuscript that you wish to design. You then save the file on tape or disc ready to load into MANUSCRIPT. The DESIGNER program enables you to design your own character sets for use on a manuscript. With these three programs the style of manuscript you can produce is only limited by your imagination!",
