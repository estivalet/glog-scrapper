  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina.htm:\n\nAfter their first few releases, Zemina seemingly became bold enough to use the games\u0027 official names for their ports. Double Dragon is one of their technically weaker early programs. The enemies all have a neat black box around their heads and move about as smoth as the digits on a digital watch. The game has only three types of foes, a bright skinned guy, a dark skinned guy and green Abobo. There\u0027s not even a proper final boss, just another Abobo who takes hundreds of hits. The moveset is converted properly, though some maneuvers like throwing are a bit tricky. Very rarely enemies drop a throwing knife, which is the only available weapon. Everything wouldn\u0027t be too bad if it weren\u0027t for the extremely annoying AI for enemies, who always sneak around areas the player can\u0027t reach.\n\nInterestingly enough, this game was not created by Zemina\u0027s former staff, but it seems they now hired Lee Kyuhwan (art design) and Lee Sanghun (programming), who had before made their first experiences with Legendly Knight and should lead the Kingdom Under Fire series to fame more than 15 years later.\n\nThe artwork for the box was stolen from Jaleco\u0027s Famicom Disk System fighting game Fuun Shaolin Ken.",
