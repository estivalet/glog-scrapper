  "note": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-zemina.htm:\n\nAt first look this seems to be a clone of Konami\u0027s Knightmare, but it is vastly improved upon on every aspect but one. Damn, this could have been such an awesome game for the MSX.\n\nThe graphics are all new, though some still betray their inspiration, like the hero\u0027s helmet, that is a powerup here. There\u0027s ten weapons and various other items to be found in initially invisible boxes, that need to be discovered by shooting at them. Multiple weapons can be carried at the same time and swapped through when needed.\n\nThere\u0027s various types of enemies, cool looking bosses and stages. Other than in Knightmare, the player gets a health bar that makes him resistent to about four or five hits. There\u0027s also a power bar that can be upgraded to increase the weapons\u0027 power, but every enemy hit draws from it much more rapidly than from the life bar.\n\nSo what\u0027s the catch? This game is beyond hard. It puts Nintendo Hard, Retro Hard, and any other thinkable kind of hard to deep shame. Anyone who can ever beat even the first boss without using cheats may be legitimately called a god. Bullet hell years before the term was coined, the enemy takes about a hundred hits, grows fast as the Roadrunner towards the end, and every single failed attempt leads back to the very beginning, such a thing as extra lives or continues don\u0027t exist in this game.\n\nToo bad about what could have been a rather awesome shmup. Another one developed by the duo Lee Kyuhwan / Lee Sanghun. Makes one wonder what has driven them to this kind of \u0026quot;balancing\u0026quot;.\n\nThe title artwork might be familiar to long time players of Dungeons\u0026amp;Dragons, as it is ripped straight from the Basic Rules book (12th to 14th print).",
