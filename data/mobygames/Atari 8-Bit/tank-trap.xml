        <description>&lt;i&gt;Tank Trap&lt;/i&gt; is an action game where the player controls a combat engineer who has to build walls in an attempt to trap a tank. The game is played from a top down perspective on single screen levels and the player can move the character around in any direction. If the wall maker is turned on a wall will automatically appear in his path. The aim of the player is simply to build walls all around the tank so that it is trapped. After hitting a wall the tank will make nine random direction changes and it will surrender if it can't find a way out. The player loses if run over by the tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game features four levels of play with different game features. In level 1 there are side walls that prevent the tank from wrapping around the screen. In the second level the tank can do this and there is also a random feature added. The tank is here able to break through slow curing walls at certain times. The player therefore has to think of reinforcing these walls. Level 3 adds civilians that the player has to protect. The game is lost if the tanks hits any of them. In the fourth level the tank is able to shoot holes in the walls unless the player stays within three rows above or below the tank.</description>
