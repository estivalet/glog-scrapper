        <description>&lt;i&gt;Shmup&lt;/i&gt; is a simple shooting game created for the &amp;quot;NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014&amp;quot; competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player controls a ship flying to the right, with enemies randomly appearing from the other side, the more frequently the longer the game is running. The player can move up and down, and shoot lasers with the joystick's Fire button. Enemies are destroyed instantly when hit by a laser, and each destroyed enemy raises the score by a single point. Collision with an enemy ship takes away one life. When all lives run out, the score and progress is displayed, and the game can be restarted. </description>
