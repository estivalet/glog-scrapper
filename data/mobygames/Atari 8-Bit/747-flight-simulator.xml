        <description>&lt;i&gt;747 Flight Simulator&lt;/i&gt; allows the player to sit at the controls of a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet airliner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The upper part of the screen consists of a simple external view (horizon, runway), while the lower displays the instrument panel (airspeed, vertical speed indicator, altimeter, artificial horizon, compass, turn and bank indicator, ILS, flaps &amp;amp; landing gear indicators, various dials for engines). After declaring the amount of fuel and the number of passengers, the player may attempt either a take-off, straight landing approach or random landing approach. The included map features Great Britain and contains 7 airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Prestwick).</description>
