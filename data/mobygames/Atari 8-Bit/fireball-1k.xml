        <description>&lt;i&gt;Fireball 1k&lt;/i&gt; was developed for the annual &lt;a href="http://www.minigamecomp.org.uk/"&gt;Mini Game Competition&lt;/a&gt; and was an entry for the 1k size category.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this shooting game, you control a ship which can move left and right along a blue line near the bottom of the screen. Bricks fall from the top of the screen; they have varying speeds - some fall slowly, some fall very fast. By pressing the Fire button, you can shoot a fireball which will destroy any bricks that get in its way. As time passes, more and more bricks begin to fall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a brick falls beyond the blue line, then the line will rise a little along with your ship. If you miss a lot of bricks, you'll soon find yourself close to the top of the screen, making it harder to hit bricks in time. The bricks harm you and decrease your energy when they touch you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shooting bricks makes the blue line descend back. If the blue line is all the way down, then shooting bricks will give you some energy. </description>
