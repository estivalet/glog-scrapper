        <description>&lt;i&gt;Wetlina '89&lt;/i&gt; is a text adventure game, loosely following the events from &lt;a href="/game/ucieczka-z-zst"&gt;Ucieczka z Z.S.T&lt;/a&gt;. The action takes place on a class trip to the Bieszczady Mountains in a small village in southeastern Poland called Wetlina. The objective of the adventure is to find items needed to write a letter home and a place to send it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The screen is divided into inventory part and descriptive text part. When the player arrives at a new location he may read a short description of the place, including possible exits, items and present individuals. The player may carry up to four items and wear clothes. The command follows a verb noun pattern or single verb orders. The game dictionary shows up after typing 'sÅÃ³wka' command.</description>
