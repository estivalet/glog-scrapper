        <description>This is a maze style single shooter rescue game involving a labyrinth named Prince Julians's diamond mines, beneath the city of Euqubud, on the Ippisissum River. These mines, long ago closed, have lured adventurers over the years seeking the legends of untold treasure buried deep beneath the earth, guarded by mysterious and terrifying creatures. None have returned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your task is to rescue one of the recently lost, a person who holds the keys of knowledge to peace and prosperity for the entire world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will be faced with moving walls which open and close avenues of progress and escape, as well as the guardians of the deep, who use their evil powers of confusion and guile as well as physical threat of death, to entrap forever the wary rescuer.</description>
