        <description>&lt;i&gt;Lode Runner's Rescue&lt;/i&gt; differs from other games in the series in that it is an isometric game similar to &lt;a href="/game/crystal-castles"&gt;Crystal Castles&lt;/a&gt;. The player takes control of Lode Runner's daughter, who has to rescue her father who has been captured by the Bungeling Empire while trying to recover stolen treasure. The game consists of 46 levels that the player has to run, jump and swim her way through. To complete each level the player has to collect all of the keys that are scattered about. Numerous enemies roam around and these simply have to be avoided. The player has three lives and when they are all gone the level has to be replaced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Included with the game is an icon based game editor that the player can use to create new levels. </description>
