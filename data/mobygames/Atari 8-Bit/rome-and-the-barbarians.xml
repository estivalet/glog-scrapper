        <description>&lt;i&gt;Rome and the Barbarians&lt;/i&gt; is set in the 5th century A.D. when the Roman empire struggled against the barbarian threat. The player takes the control over the empire in an attempt to bring things under control. The game is played on a top-down European map with abstract symbols representing units etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority of the game focuses on economical aspects. Money from taxes is key, as it is used to pay for troops and bribe barbarians tribes - therefore it is important to read the statistical data which is given on separate menu screens. But of course there is also a military component: uprising barbarians have to be defeated and important cities brought back to the empire. Movement order for units are directly given on the map.</description>
