        <description>Cult hero Matthew Smith followed up &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Manic+Miner"&gt;Manic Miner&lt;/a&gt; with a seminal platform game. Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.</description>
