        <description>&lt;i&gt;Super Zaxxon&lt;/i&gt; is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon.  The differences are:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
