        <description>&lt;i&gt;War-Copter&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade game. East coast of the state is attacked by hostile country. Preventing full country invasion requires destroying the enemy naval base from which hostile ships and missiles are sent. Player's role is to protect the copter repair centre and destroy enemy base located on the far east. Limited resource requires scavenging debris from the sunk ships and altering them in own factories into ammunition. The fuel consumption depends on the amount of carried materials. The fuel may be resupplied on the base's grey pads.</description>
