        <description>Number 13 in the Adventure series from Scott Adams, and the first which was never released in all-text format (except for BBC, Electron, Dragon and TRS-80 versions).  Solon, the Master Wizard has lost the 13 Stars of Power.  It is up to you, his faithful apprentice, to retrieve them from Claymorgue Castle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is similar to the other SAGA games in the series.  Additionally, there is some use of magic of course!</description>
