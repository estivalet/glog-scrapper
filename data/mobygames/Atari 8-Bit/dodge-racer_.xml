        <description>&lt;i&gt;Dodge Racer&lt;/i&gt; is a simple arcade game, created for the &amp;quot;NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014&amp;quot; competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the game, the player controls a car (represented by a single pixel) which must survive on a racetrack as long as possible, avoiding running into walls and into the single-pixel obstacles that keep rapidly appearing on the track. If, upon crashing, the player has scored a minimum of 800 points (10 points are gained for each obstacle that appears), he finds himself on a new, circular racetrack. The game keeps track of high score. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Version 1.1 of the game adds an on-screen score display, as well as score multipliers gained for making a lap around the entire racetrack. At first, each obstacle is worth 1 point; completing each lap increases this value and gives a large score bonus. The second level now requires 1000 points to access. </description>
