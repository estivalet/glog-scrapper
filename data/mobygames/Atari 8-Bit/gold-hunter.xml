        <description>&lt;i&gt;Gold Hunter&lt;/i&gt; is an action arcade game. Your task is to reach the gold placed in a well. To enter the well you must collect all the items dropped in the labyrinth. To do so you need to find a carrying sack first and then go for the rest of the things. Precise jumping and perfect timing is the only weapon against hostile creatures and flame traps. Contact with the enemies and other obstacles means a loss of life. By collecting the special keys and using them on the magical chests you can gain one time use 30 seconds of extra speed and immortality. An additional difficulty is the time limit. You have only eighteen minutes to reach the well.</description>
