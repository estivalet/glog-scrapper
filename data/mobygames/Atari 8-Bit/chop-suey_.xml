        <description>&lt;i&gt;Chop Suey&lt;/i&gt; is a one vs. one martial arts fighting game. It is designed to be played with an eight-direction joystick and each direction translates into a different move: moving left or right, jumping straight up or over something, high or low kick, body kick and jab. Each successful attack against the opponent means that his pain bar goes up, but it will go down fast if pressure is not kept up. When the bar is full, the POW symbol blinks and the fighter will go down with the next hit. He will recover after a few seconds, but an eighth of the bar will be permanently stuck in pain. The match ends when a fighter goes down eight times or the timer runs out. If the player is the winner, the next match features a more difficult opponent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two air vents are installed on each side of the screen. Sometimes scorpions fall out of these vents and the player should avoid them because of their deadly sting. Before starting the game, the player can choose between a slow and fast playing mode. </description>
