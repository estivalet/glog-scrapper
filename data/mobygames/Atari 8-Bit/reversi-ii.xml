        <description>&lt;i&gt;Reversi II&lt;/i&gt; is a computer conversion of the popular two players board game Reversi, also known as Othello. The player may compete against the computer with a choice of six skill levels or against human player. The aim is to fill the board with as many pawns of own color as possible by flanking opponent's pawns (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) to capture them and reverse their color. </description>
