        <description>&lt;i&gt;Telly Turtle&lt;/i&gt; is basically a port of the LOGO programming language with the main character being a turtle. The keypad buttons of the Colecovision are used to issue commands from a selection presented on-screen and eventually, programs can be formed to move Telly Turtle around the screen in a series of directions.
Music and Sound Effects are also added into the mix to broaden the programming experience.</description>
