        <description>&lt;i&gt;Savage Island&lt;/i&gt; is the only multi-part game in &lt;a href="/search/quick?developer=Scott+Adams"&gt;Scott Adams'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Scott+Adams+adventure"&gt;adventure series&lt;/a&gt;, all of which have a very similar parser and interface.  At the completion of this game, players receive a password which allows &lt;a href="/game/savage-island-part-two"&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; to be played. The Savage Island games are also probably the most difficult adventures in the series!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player begins trapped on a small remote island in the ocean, which is facing a hurricane and also has an active volcano. The player can cross a river, and will also need to explore a cave network. Items are often found by running through the sand with one's hands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The island holds a great secret, which will not be discovered until both parts of the game have been completed.</description>
