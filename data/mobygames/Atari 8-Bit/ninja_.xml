        <description>This is an side-scrolling beat-'em-up game consisting of a succession of fights, in which you (surprisingly) play a ninja whose job is to go through the playfield and kill everyone in his path. You are also equipped with a dagger and a shuriken which you can hurl at your enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must also collect &amp;quot;idols&amp;quot; which are left lying around), which will reinvigorate you, as well as grant you further points. Once you collect all of the idols, you will have won the game.
