        <description>&lt;i&gt;Hangman&lt;/i&gt; is an electronic version of the game hangman! Your goal is to figure out a word that the computer has generated by guessing one letter at a time. Guess a correct letter, and it will appear on the screen in the proper location, but if you guess a letter that isn't in the word then you are one step closer to being hung. Guess eleven incorrect letters, and the game is over. A point is earned each time a word is completed. Several difficulty settings are included which affect the number of letters in the words. The game can be played by one or two players, and in the two player version the words can optionally be created by one of the players instead of the computer.</description>
