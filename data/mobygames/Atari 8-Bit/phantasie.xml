        <description>The island of Gelnor has been taken over by The Black Knights, who demand sacrifices and homage as they travel from town to town.  Defeat them and their master, Nikademus!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Phantasie&lt;/i&gt; is a classic role-playing game, and one of the first to introduce a &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; for storing money in addition to expanding on the classic &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=wizardry"&gt;Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;-style gameplay of building your own adventuring party with traveling from town to town via the countryside, overhead views of dungeons, and multiple styles of attack.</description>
