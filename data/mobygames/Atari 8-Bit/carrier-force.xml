        <description>Carrier Force is an operational level game featuring combat between American and Japanese forces in 1942. The game was later updated as &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Carrier+Strike"&gt;Carrier Strike&lt;/a&gt;. There are 4 scenarios covered in this game, Midway, Coral Sea, The Battle of the Eastern Solomons and The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Every major warship and plane is accounted for and accurately detailed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each game turn represents one hour of action. The computer handles all the administrative chores while you give the orders and plot strategy. The game can be played by up to two people or in solitaire where the computer plays the Japanese. At the end of the game victory points are determined and the Japanese points are subtracted from the US points and compared to a table to determine the victory level. The game is advanced level and the playing time is 3 to 10 hours.</description>
