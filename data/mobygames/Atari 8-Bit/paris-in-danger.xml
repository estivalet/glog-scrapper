        <description>&lt;i&gt;Paris in Danger&lt;/i&gt; recreates the 1814 campaign against Napoleon's France, when allied Russian, Prussian and Austrian forces of the Sixth Coalition were marching towards Paris. It is played on both strategical (on a map of entire France and today's western Germany; corps size units) and tactical level (battles, which can be also resolved automatically; division size units), from either side of the conflict. Effects of morale, unit facing and formation are taken into account.&lt;br&gt;
The players gain victory points (the French for killing enemies, the Allies for capturing cities), which are summed up after 25 turns (each lasting few days) to declare the winner.</description>
