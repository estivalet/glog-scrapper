        <description>&lt;i&gt;Technus&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game, similar to &lt;a href="/game/turrican"&gt;Turrican&lt;/a&gt;. In the year 3748 the Intergalactic Command Center faces a new deadly threat. Davor rebels began construction of weapons of mass destruction. Neutralization of the weaponry requires finding eight reservoirs with liquid hydrogen and placing them in a special reactor. The task was entrusted to the latest generation cyborg called Technus, equipped with a laser blaster and a limited ability of controlled jumping. The numerous enemies must be eliminated or avoided, contact with them or with rotating golden stars takes some energy. The energy and ammo may be supplemented by collecting special power ups.</description>
