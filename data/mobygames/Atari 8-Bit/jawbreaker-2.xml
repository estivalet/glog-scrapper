        <description>In &lt;i&gt;JawBreaker 2&lt;/i&gt; the player has to remove all jewels from the screen. Jewels can be removed if two or more symbols of the same type are next to each other. The remaining jewels will fall down into the gaps created by the removed jewels. Removing jewels will also increase your overall score. &lt;i&gt;JawBreaker 2&lt;/i&gt; made its debut on the &amp;quot;Deregeneracja Party 2015&amp;quot;, a Polish Atari scene party.</description>
