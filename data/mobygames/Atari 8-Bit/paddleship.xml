        <description>&lt;i&gt;Paddleship&lt;/i&gt; is an action game created for the &amp;quot;NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014&amp;quot; competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player controls a spaceship, and the goal is to reach another ship in a random location on the screen. The player's ship can only be moved via a paddle controller. The position of the paddle knob determines the speed of the ship's rotation, and pressing the fire button causes the ship to fly forward in its facing direction. There is a time limit, and once it is reached, the game ends and the score is displayed. </description>
