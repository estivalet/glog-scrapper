        <description>River Raid with side-scrolling? Exactly, that's what &lt;i&gt;River Rescue&lt;/i&gt; like. A team of important scientists have become trapped in a dangerous jungle. It's at you, boarding your powerful river gun-boat, to collect the reward offered for their rescue. Floating logs, menacing crocodiles, enemy helicopters dropping mines on you - can you save the scientists?</description>
