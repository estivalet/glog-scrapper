        <description>Using the same game engine and structure as &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Level+9+Computing%2c+Ltd%2e"&gt;Level 9&lt;/a&gt;'s game of &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Secret+Diary+of+Adrian+Mole"&gt;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole&lt;/a&gt;, the book's follow-up was recreated on computer. The game is an adventure of sorts, presenting you with 18 months of life viewed through the curious, confused and intellectual eyes of Adrian. Each section features a number of challenges, in which one of three choices on what to do must be made. As you play, the aim is to make Adrian as popular as possible by making the correct choices so as to exert a positive impression on Mum, Dad, Pandora, Nigel, Bert and all the rest. The game is split into four sections, which can be loaded individually or in sequence, with the score remaining in memory as you progress through them.</description>
