        <description>&lt;i&gt;Streets&lt;/i&gt; is a first person shooter. The player assumes the role of a Megapolis police officer named Harry, and shoots enemy gangsters. The game takes place on a single side-scrolling location. The player's task is to track down and kill all the enemies. A new enemy appears every three seconds in the place indicated by the horizontal arrows. The player moves viewfinder to the right, left, up or down. Before the passage of time, the player has to locate the enemy, shoot him or hide. The game offers a total of five levels. </description>
