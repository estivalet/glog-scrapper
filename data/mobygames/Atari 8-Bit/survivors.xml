        <description>Almost a thousand people have been trapped in a hibernation dome after a nuclear war. The player takes control over three droids and must use their abilities to rescue the survivors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seen from a top-down perspective, &lt;i&gt;The Survivors&lt;/i&gt; plays somewhat similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash"&gt;Boulder Dash&lt;/a&gt; as the levels are filled with sand and rocks. Droid 1 is the only droid that can dig through the earth, Droid 2 can beam survivors to safety (by moving over them) and Droid 3 can push rocks (only one at a time). The goal in each of the seven levels is to rescue all survivors within the time limit, while paying attention not to trap or damage any of the droids. Removing sand or pushing around rocks might cause other rocks to fall down and crash the droids. There are also Guardian Droids whose circuits have been damaged by the nuclear fall-out, causing them to run rampant. They damage the players droids on contact.</description>
