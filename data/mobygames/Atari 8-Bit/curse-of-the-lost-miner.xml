        <description>&lt;i&gt;Curse of the Lost Miner&lt;/i&gt; is the sequel to &lt;a href="/game/caverns-of-the-lost-miner"&gt;Caverns of the Lost Miner&lt;/a&gt;, featuring more diverse cave graphics and updated sound and music. General gameplay remains the same. Once again the player controls a smiling head through a total of thirteen, increasingly difficult caves, which each consist of a single screen. Each cave contains several diamonds. Once all diamonds are collected the player reaches the next cave. The gameplay is heavily influenced by Manic Miner. A life is lost if the player hits deadly objects / surfaces or falls down from high platforms.</description>
