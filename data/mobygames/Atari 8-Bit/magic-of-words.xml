        <description>&lt;i&gt;Magic of Words&lt;/i&gt; is a puzzle game. The aim is to create a password indicated on the top side of the screen. To accomplish the mission the player must join together the letters in the correct sequence next to each other. The letters and other elements move in the indicated direction until they are stopped by another element or the edge of the board. The task is complicated by the special bricks and a limited number of moves. The elements such as stones may be used as an assistance, for example to destroy a mine field or cover a repulsing brick.</description>
