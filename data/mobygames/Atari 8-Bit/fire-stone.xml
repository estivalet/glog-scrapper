        <description>&lt;i&gt;Fire Stone&lt;/i&gt; is a puzzle game similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Boulder+Dash"&gt;Boulder Dash&lt;/a&gt;. The aim is to collect the right amount of gems (components of Crystal of Power shattered by a magician named Argos) to open the door to the next room before time runs out. In addition to the expiry of time the player will face moving monsters and falling rocks. The game offers a total of sixteen chambers.</description>
