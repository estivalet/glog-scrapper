        <description>&lt;i&gt;Barkonid&lt;/i&gt; for Atari is the first game in the series. The gameplay is similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Arkanoid"&gt;Arkanoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Breakout"&gt;Breakout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are over 100 levels and a final assembly. The game can be played with a joystick or gamepad. The player can pick up bonus capsules that contain various positive or negative extras. These bonuses have to be taken with the ball and not just with the board to be absorbed. Examples include a laser, extra lives, level jumps, glue and much more.</description>
