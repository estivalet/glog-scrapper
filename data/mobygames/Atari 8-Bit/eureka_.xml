        <description>&lt;i&gt;Eureka&lt;/i&gt; is a puzzle game where the player's goal is to arrange gems (which come in various types) into specific designs. The design to be created is displayed on the left of the screen, and the current arrangement of gems is on the right. By clicking on a gem here, the player turns it into another type of gem - clicked multiple times, it cycles between various types of gems (the sequence is displayed at the top of the screen) and finally disappears, with all the gems above it falling down. Clicking on a gem also changes the four gems around it - but these neighboring gems cycle forward by two types of gems instead of one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 50 levels. If stuck, the player can press Space to restart the level, but this makes him lose a life. There is a time limit, and running out of time causes the player to lose a life and the level to restart. </description>
