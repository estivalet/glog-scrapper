        <description>The protagonist of this puzzler is a reneged jack escaped from a box, thanks to a mutation of feet growing out of his spring. You'll control him as he kicks his way through the games puzzles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'll be able to make your springman wander up and down the left side of the screen pushing a tile with a symbol on it before him. This tile can be kicked to the left where a stack of tiles await. If you've lined up your tile with a matching one on the other side they all shall vanish, if any tiles are above they'll fall into the newly vacant spaces. You'll also have a limited number of lightning tiles which will act like the sort of tile that it comes in contact with after you kick it. After you clear all the blocks you will be moved to a new level with, hopefully, a new background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each level has a number of neutral tiles that you can bounce your tiles off to have them hit another area of the tile mass that you're trying to clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A two player mode is also available where you can play against someone else on the same computer. Instead of clearing levels you'll play to see who can get a certain score. After that is reached a new area will begin.</description>
