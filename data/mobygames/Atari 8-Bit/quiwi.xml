        <description>&lt;i&gt;Quiwi&lt;/i&gt; is a quiz game for multiple players taking turns. Players must answer questions from one of six different main topics like geography, art and literature or history and politics. After clicking the mouse once, an archer fires an arrow at a target that rotates colours corresponding to each of the main topics. The colour that is in the middle of the target once the arrow hits will be the topic for the next question. If the colour happens to be black, the player can directly select the topic of their choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a question has been asked, the player must first think about the answer and then reveal it by clicking on a button. If the player was correct, they can choose a &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; button, otherwise there are &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no score&amp;quot; buttons. A right answer increases the player's score for the corresponding topic.</description>
