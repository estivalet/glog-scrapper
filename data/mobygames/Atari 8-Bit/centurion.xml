        <description>&lt;i&gt;Centurion&lt;/i&gt; is a turn-based strategy game.  The game takes place in the Ancient Rome. The player starts with one province and one legion. His task is to conquer all the provinces on the map.  Each province can be managed by setting taxes, creating garrison and organizing entertainment. Entertainment competitions increase satisfaction and reduces the possibility of the outbreak of the rebellion. The player can raise invasion legions and built defensive garrisons in each province. The army consists of infantry and cavalry. The player has no effect on the battle, which is presented in the form of decreasing number of troops. The only available option is to flee.</description>
