        <description>&lt;i&gt;Maze of Death&lt;/i&gt; is similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Atari"&gt;Atari&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Adventure"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; (not the least visually) but has less puzzle solving and is more about collecting things and avoiding traps and enemies. The player controls an agent whose task it is to stop a cosmitron device from exploding. The device has become critical after a sinister scientist has removed it's radiation control cubes and the player has to retrieve a number of these (two to four depending on level) and put them back in the device. There is a time limit and if the cubes are not brought back in time everything will blow up. Making contact with various obstacles and enemies will also lead to failure. There are five difficulty levels which decide the time limit and which obstacles the player will come across. Enemies include roaming robots while traps include mines in dark rooms where sound is the player's only clue and lasers that randomly flash as the player passes through a room. </description>
