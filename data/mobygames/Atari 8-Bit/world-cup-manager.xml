        <description>&lt;i&gt;World Cup Manager&lt;/i&gt; recreates the role of a manager in the 1986 football World Cup - by default the 24 teams have the same names as the real-life qualifiers. The competition format is the same - there are two group stages, whittling the teams down to 12 in the second round, then a knock-out semi final and final. Matches are played out via a running commentary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your team is pre-selected and there are no substitutions; the player's main impact is tactical. You must choose one of the three formations provided, and have three options for each aspect of match play. Should you defend using a sweeper system? Should you play corners to the near post? Should you make fast attacking breaks? Before the tournament starts, you choose four teams to scout, gaining crucial information on their tactics. </description>
