        <description>&lt;i&gt;Spellicopter&lt;/i&gt; is an educational software game that enables children to develop their spelling skills in order to remain in flight. The screen display shows speed, altitude, fuel level, score and cargo. It offers three levels of difficulty, allowing the student to learn up to 400 words, in 40 categories, in beginner, intermediate and advanced modes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The program could be played using keyboard or joystick, giving a sentence context clue for each word, allowing the student to maintain altitude and speed for correct spellings, utilizing screen graphics, animation and sound effects.</description>
