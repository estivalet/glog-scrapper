        <description>This racing game is viewed from above, with the circuits comprising junctions, multiple paths and a variety of corner types. There are also hazards off the road to accelerate and steer your vehicle away from. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Icy and wet roads are available, which affect the car's handling. There are 5 available maximum speeds, 3 levels of acceleration, and an 'Only on a computer mode' in which the hazards are merely decoration to drive through. A track editor is also on offer.</description>
