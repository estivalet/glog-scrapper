        <description>Godart the evil wizard has kidnapped the beautiful princess Fiscella. The valiant prince Roderic, knowing that Godart's keep is virtually impossible to infiltrate by an intruder, proposed himself as a hostage in exchange for Fiscella. Godart agreed, counting on a large ransom. Yet he forgot about young Roderic's knowledge of magic. A few spells and magical herbs, and Godart was gone for good. Now Roderic is alone in Godart's castle - and he needs to get out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roderic&lt;/i&gt; is a platform adventure game, where you have to collect items scattered throughout the castle to use them in solving puzzles elsewhere. You can carry up to 3 items at a time. With them, you can open blocked passages or avoid sudden death. There are some situations in the game which can kill you - falling chandeliers and rooms filled with deadly traps, to name a few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The castle has three levels (1st floor, basement, roof), between which you can move with an elevator. </description>
