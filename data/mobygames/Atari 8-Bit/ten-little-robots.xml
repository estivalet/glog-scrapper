        <description>&lt;i&gt;Ten Little Robots&lt;/i&gt; is an educational game for preschoolers. It teaches math and computer use and consists of five activities that all involve robots:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Robot Story:&lt;/b&gt; An interactive rhyme where the story is read out and the player has to fill in how many robots are still remaining. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Letter Match:&lt;/b&gt; The game shows a letter and the player has to locate it on the keyboard and press it. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Count The Robots:&lt;/b&gt; A number of robots are shown and the player has to count them and enter the right number.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robot Addition:&lt;/b&gt; The player has to answer simple addition problems by entering the right sum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robot Drawing (8-bit version only):&lt;/b&gt; A drawing game where the player moves a robot between paint pots of different colors and can freely draw on the screen.
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robot Construction (16-bit version only):&lt;/b&gt; The player gets to build a robot by choosing from different parts. First a body is chosen and then heads, legs and arms can be selected in any order. &lt;/li&gt;
