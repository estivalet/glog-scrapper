        <description>&lt;em&gt;Story Machine&lt;/em&gt; is a product aimed at children for teaching language skills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The product contains animations assigned to key nouns, and verbs. By typing phrases such as &amp;quot;The Girl Jumps Over the Flower&amp;quot; will show the player an animation of a girl jumping over a flower. Through this method, players are able to create short &amp;quot;stories&amp;quot; of about 40 words long and have the computer animate them. These stories are also limited to having 4 &amp;quot;actors&amp;quot; (animated noun objects) in each.</description>
