        <description>&lt;i&gt;Agonia&lt;/i&gt; is an action platform game. The aim of the player is to find secret plans hidden in the locked and highly guarded safe and getting to the evacuation exit. The game takes place in a base consisting of three levels. Changing the level of the base is possible after finding a magnetic card allowing access to the elevator. To open the safe the player must launch the main computer and find the burner and the gas bottle. The base is guarded by the soldiers, mechanical or electric barriers. The player has no weapon, he can only jump and avoid enemies. Contact with the enemies means a loss of energy, contact with electricity and acid means an instant death. The energy power-ups are not implemented in the game. The main character may carry up to four items.</description>
