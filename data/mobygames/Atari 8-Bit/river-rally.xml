        <description>&lt;i&gt;River Rally&lt;/i&gt; is a top-down racing game that can be played by two players simultaneously. Players control a boat with throttle acceleration to race through a winding river and collect sunken treasure marked by a dollar sign. It is collected by driving over it and it needs to be taken to a bank to deposit it safely. The boats can also use ramps to negotiate the river banks. In a two-player split-screen game, players can lay down mines to hinder the opponent and collide to steal the opponent's money. In the single-player game the player needs to find a set amount of money before time runs out. Only one bag is visible at a time and a total of nine needs to be found.</description>
