        <description>&lt;i&gt;Zbir&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game. The action takes place in a Malaskara river basin, in a land called Krugundia. The player is a common thug, who turned out to be a forgotten prince. To regain the player must traverse the castle of evil sorcerer to find three symbols of authority: crown, scepter and golden apple. Some locked places are available after finding the appropriate items. The castle is inhabited by randomly appearing hostile beings, such as phantoms, mutants, spiders or ghosts. The contract with them means a loss of life. The creatures may be killed by a short sword or over jumped. </description>
