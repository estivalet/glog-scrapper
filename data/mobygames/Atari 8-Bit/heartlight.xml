        <description>A game that's very similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=boulder+dash"&gt; Boulder Dash&lt;/a&gt; - the basic idea of collecting things while avoiding being crushed is the same. The protagonist of the game is a dwarf named Mosiek, who decided to marry Rachel. A necessary condition, however, is showing the cunning and skill. He goes to a magical world in order to collect all the hearts. Assisting in completing the task are bombs and balloons, disturb stones and walls. In each level player must collect all the hearts, in order to open a door-portal to the next stage. The game features 64 levels.</description>
