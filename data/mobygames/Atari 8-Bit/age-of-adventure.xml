        <description>Billed as &amp;quot;the greatest adventures in history,&amp;quot; this game was actually two games in one: &lt;a href="/game/return-of-heracles"&gt;The Return of Heracles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/game/ali-baba-and-the-forty-thieves"&gt;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both games are somewhat similarly constructed, as they were built on an engine that is a precursor to Stuart Smith's &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Adventure+Construction+Set"&gt;Adventure Construction Set&lt;/a&gt;. Control multiple characters via a top-down perspective on various quests throughout the mythological past. Find items, increase your stats, battle monsters, and explore the land in these turn-based RPGs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both games feature a cooperative component that lets any number of players play together, simply by dividing up the available characters.</description>
