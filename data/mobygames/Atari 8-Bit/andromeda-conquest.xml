        <description>&lt;i&gt;Andromeda Conquest&lt;/i&gt; is a strategy / conquest game in which one to four players build galactic empires by establishing and defending space colonies, managing resources, and battling other players for control of star systems. Before every turn, players receive resources from all their colonies. Those have to be used up during the turn or they are lost. Depending on the numbers of players the galaxy consists of 12 to 48 star systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The layout is grid-based, and the package includes a pad of graph paper for keeping track of ship and colony locations.</description>
