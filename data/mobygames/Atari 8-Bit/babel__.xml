        <description>&lt;i&gt;Babel&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade two-players game, referring to the biblical story. The goal of both opponents is to reach as many stars as possible to outscore the opponent. The players lay the bricks that let them climb to the stars. Each touched star disappears after giving points. The game features 3 difficulty levels - first two start with built towers, last one starts at ground level, additionally the fall of the brick on the last two levels causes loss of all gained points! Random celestial events add extra stars in the sky and may result in lightning strike - if the player is hit his score plummets to 5 and he's knocked to the ground.</description>
