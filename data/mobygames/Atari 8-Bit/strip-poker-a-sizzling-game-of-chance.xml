        <description>You are a male player, who wants to undress your woman opponent playing cards. In 5-card poker, you bet own money for a round and if you are lucky, then collect winnings and watch your opponent undress. Your opponent removes clothing every time she loses one hundred dollars. You must make her strip five times to win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The master disk contains two opponents, Suzi and Melissa, but you may acquire Data disks to add other opponents like Marlena, Candi, etc.</description>
