        <description>&lt;i&gt;Klony 2010&lt;/i&gt; is a puzzle board game where the player competes with the computer. The aim is to fill the board with as many own cells as possible. The cells can be moved two squares in any direction, including diagonally, or can be cloned by selecting the empty field next to our cell. By placing the cell next to opponent's cells, the player will take them over and change the genetic code to the opposite. The stage is finished when all empty spaces on the board are filled or after the destruction of all opponent's cells. The number of cells remaining on board decides who won the duel. A draw is impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is an enhanced version of &lt;a href="/game/klony"&gt;Klony&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2006.</description>
