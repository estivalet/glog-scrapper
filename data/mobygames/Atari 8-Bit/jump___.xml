        <description>&lt;i&gt;Jump!!!&lt;/i&gt; is a simple arcade game created for the &amp;quot;NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014&amp;quot; competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 9 lines long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player controls a ball which can be moved left and right. The screen is constantly scrolling upwards. The player must help the ball roll off the platforms and fall to lower levels before it ends up at the top of the screen. The ball must also be protected from falling off the bottom of the screen. When the game is over, the score is shown, and the player is congratulated if they got a new high score. </description>
