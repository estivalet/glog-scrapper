        <description>Sneak your way through the Soviet Embassy in Pyongyang via elevators, avoiding Soviet security on different floors to piece together the encrypted message.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a platform game.  You move from floor to floor avoiding the security that is constantly moving up and down on elevators.  As you climb, you will collect all of the pieces that form an encrypted message as you advance to the next level.</description>
