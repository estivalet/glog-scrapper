        <description>&lt;i&gt;Space Arena&lt;/i&gt; is a simple multiplayer-only game in which up to four players control little space ships inside a rectangular playing field. To score points, players have to shoot down the space ships of the other players. The game was specifically designed for use with paddle controllers. In 2014 the game got a little upgrade with support for the Multijoy interface. That version was titled &lt;i&gt;Space Arena M4&lt;/i&gt;.</description>
