        <description>A musical game with four modes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catch a Coco-Note - Pick notes out of a pool with your fishing pool. Once you've picked enough you can hear the band play the melody you've picked out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composin' Coco-Notes - Same game as the first, except now played with an accompaniment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beat The Clam - Race against a clam trying to claim notes from the pool and get a high score while finishing the song. Collect bonus notes for extra score and avoid the clam as he'll eat your fishing line as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beat The Clam -- Challenge - Same game as above except the clam is much faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
