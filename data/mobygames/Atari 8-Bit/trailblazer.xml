        <description>An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump and thus avoid these holes, although you have a limited number of them for each level, and it's possible to  adjust the speed through joystick or keyboard control. You also face a time limit on each of the levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one.</description>
