        <description>&lt;i&gt;Phantasie II&lt;/i&gt; is the sequel to the role-playing game &lt;a href="/game/phantasie"&gt;Phantasie&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing has changed substantially: the gameplay and the graphics are identical to Phantasie. The adventuring party travels from town to town using a overview map of the countryside. There are many dungeons to explore and many different monsters to battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again the Dark Lord Nikademus is the players' evil opponent, having fashioned an evil orb and cast a curse on the beautiful island of Ferronrah, enslaving its people. The players' mission is to find and destroy the evil orb.</description>
