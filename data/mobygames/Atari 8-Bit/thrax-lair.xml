        <description>&lt;i&gt;Thrax Lair&lt;/i&gt; is a vertical shoot'em-up, that kind of resembles River Raid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrax, insect-like, cave-dwelling creatures, have always stolen the eggs from tarps and their offsprings. 
Tarps are pterodactyl-size creatures that have the ability to shoot electro-chemical energy through its eyes.
This is a recreation of a tarp raid on a thrax lair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You control up to 3 tarps and for every 10,000 points you score you awarded with an extra tarp.
The tarp can fire energy bursts from its eyes in the front direction, left, right, and the diagonal front directions.
You score points by shooting enemies. The faster you fly the more points you get. Depending on the kind of thrax you are awarded with more or less points:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Workers will give you 30 victory points.
Soldiers will give you 75 victory points.
Stingers will give you 150 victory points.
Monitors will give you 350 victory points. 
To kill a Monitor or Stinger you have to hit the eyes.</description>
