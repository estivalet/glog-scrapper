        <description>&lt;i&gt;Cywilizacja&lt;/i&gt; (Civilization) is a tactic strategy game, similar in its gameplay to &lt;a href="/game/empire-wargame-of-the-century"&gt;Empire: Wargame of the Century&lt;/a&gt;. The player takes control of the world's armed forces, opposing an army led by a rogue general. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game takes place on the world map, covered with cities; depending on the difficulty level, the number of cities that belong to the player and to the computer opponent are different. Some of the cities already have military units stationed in them. Playing in turns, the players each move their units around and give building orders to the cities. The goal of each player is to take over all the cities and destroy all of the enemy military. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each of a player's units can move during his turn, as long as it still has movement points left for that turn; units also use up fuel and regularly have to refill it by entering a city--an unit that runs out of fuel is immobile. Upon contact with an enemy unit, combat breaks out, ending with the opposing units losing some of its manpower. An unit is destroyed once its manpower reaches 0. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cities can be ordered to construct units--ground vehicles, planes, and ships; the more population there is in a city, the faster it builds units, and the more room it has for stationing units. Stronger units take more time to produce. </description>
