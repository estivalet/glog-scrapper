        <description>You, Conan the Barbarian, must enter a castle and defeat the evil Volta.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are armed with ten boomerang swords and your 
own cunning.  Along the way magic gems, keys and an &amp;quot;Avian Ally&amp;quot; will help you through seven very diverse levels in which you must navigate treacherous obstacles including lava pits, powerful geysers that hurl you into the air, spike pits, and floating platforms.  Volta's castle is guarded by several of his nasty beasts: bats, scorpions, giant ants, fire-breathing dragons, floating eyeballs, and even a huge electrical generator gone haywire -- you'll soon realize why he calls himself &amp;quot;Volta&amp;quot;.</description>
