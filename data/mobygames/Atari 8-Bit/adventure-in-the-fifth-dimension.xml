        <description>Mostly written in Atari BASIC (with a hint of 6502 assembly), this game was &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,202/"&gt;Brian Moriarty&lt;/a&gt;'s first text adventure.  Its player controls a private investigator on the trail of extra-terrestrial burglars who have stolen the Declaration of Independence!  There are clues to be found in the &amp;quot;maze of streets&amp;quot; representing Washington D.C. and, of course, there is the upper dimension promised in its title to be traversed with the game's text parser interface.</description>
