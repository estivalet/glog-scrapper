        <description>This is a compilation of three games by Imagic:  &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Laser+Gates"&gt;Laser Gates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/game/imagic-1-2-3"&gt;Quickstep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Wing+War"&gt;Wing War&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laser Gates is a side scrolling shoot-em-up in the same genre as &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Scramble"&gt;Scramble&lt;/a&gt;. You must blast through gates before you hit them as well as fight enemy ships and installations.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Quick Step&amp;quot; is a 1-2 player game where food items scroll down the screen vertically, and you must hop from item to item and change the item to your color.  But you play against an opponent (human or computer) who is trying to change it to their color.   You must make the color change before the item scrolls off the screen, but if you are standing on the object as it scrolls of, you lose a life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &amp;quot;Wing War&amp;quot;, you play a dragon who is trying to collect her eggs and return them to her lair.  The player flies from screen to screen and encounters various creatures while hunting for eggs.</description>
