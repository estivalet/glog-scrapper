        <description>&lt;i&gt;Problem Jasia (Johny's Trouble)&lt;/i&gt; is a timed puzzle board game. The player's task is to create twelve posters of movie stars for the birthday of Johnny's fiancÃ©e. Each poster is made up of twenty pieces. The player has five minutes to properly place all the pieces of the poster on a 5x4 board. A fragment of the poster is released from the base placed next to upper left part of the board. Each fragment of the poster may be moved horizontally or vertically. A piece moves in the indicated direction until it is stopped by another object or the end of the board. Each piece of the poster can be returned back to the base. The correct position of the selected fragment of the poster is shown on a separate board on the left. Once in a while the base launches a surprise, such as additional minute, subtracted minute, swapping two fragments, completion of the poster, bomb. The negative surprises should be immediately returned to the base.</description>
