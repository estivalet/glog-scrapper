        <description>&lt;i&gt;Caveman&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game set in the prehistoric times, similar to &lt;a href="/game/prehistorik"&gt;Prehistorik&lt;/a&gt;; as a caveman, we have to find food for our family on each level. Our hero wander around the wilderness and explores caves in his search. Hostile animals and plants have to be avoided; contact with them drains health. There are also dangerous environment elements, such as bonfires or deep water. There is a time limit on each level, and a specific amount of food to be collected before the level can be completed. </description>
