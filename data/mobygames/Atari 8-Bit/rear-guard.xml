        <description>A side-scrolling space shooting game, a bit like Defender, in which you must blast enemy drones and their missiles before they can destroy the mothership you're protecting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five ships come at you from the right and are worth between 25 and 200 points. A freighter flies in the same direction as you (left to right) and is worth 300 points. In addition, a satellite identified by an F on its side that later changes to an S flies by. Hitting the satellite while it displays an F gives you a fuel recharge, while hitting it with an S gives you a shield recharge.</description>
