        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Journey to the Planets&lt;/i&gt;, you play a spacefarer who must find a way to return to his home planet. To do this, you need to collect various treasures from several unexplored worlds. Sometimes you will need to shoot your way to a particular treasure; other times, you will need to solve a set of puzzles to reach your goal. Once you recover all the treasures, you must pilot your starship through uncharted space with a limited amount of fuel and find your home planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 1983 cartridge release features a different soundtrack and tones down some of the more difficult puzzles.</description>
