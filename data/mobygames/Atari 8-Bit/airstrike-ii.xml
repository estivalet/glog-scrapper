        <description>&lt;i&gt;Airstrike II&lt;/i&gt; takes you back to planet Cyclon, armed with an improved Mark X fighter ship, with the aim of clearing all 5 zones. These are full of tight &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Scramble"&gt;Scramble&lt;/a&gt;-style crevices and tunnels, as well as heat-sensitive missiles, doors which must be blasted out, and enemy ships. You have a laser gun and missiles at your disposal. You have limited fuel and ammo, but this can be replenished by shooting the dumps which contain them (marked F and A respectively). The game is split into five zones (with identical layouts but an increasing amount of enemies, worth more and more points)</description>
