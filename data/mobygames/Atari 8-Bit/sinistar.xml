        <description>Originating in the arcades, &lt;i&gt;Sinistar&lt;/i&gt; is a multi-directional shooter. In the game, you must fly your ship about, shooting the floating asteroids to release Sinisite crystals. These crystals must be gathered to create Sinibombs. Also gathering crystals are worker drones. They are gathering crystals to build Sinistar, who wants to destroy the universe. As the workers will sometimes steal your mined crystals, feel free to blast them. Also flying about are warrior ships who want to blast you to protect the workers and Sinistar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once Sinistar is completed, he will announce &amp;quot;Beware! I live!&amp;quot; and begin chasing you. Hopefully, you have made enough Sinibombs to destroy him. As he chases you, press the fire button to release Sinibombs to damage him. Once he is completely destroyed, you are off to the next, harder, level.</description>
