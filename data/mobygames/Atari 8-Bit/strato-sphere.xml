        <description>&lt;i&gt;Strato Sphere&lt;/i&gt; is a second part of &lt;a href="/game/excelsor"&gt;Excelsor&lt;/a&gt;. The action takes place five years later after first part of the series, on the earth's orbit. The player is a space bi-wing fighter pilot and must destroy 16 alien motherships surrounded by spherical shields and defense system. The ships are guarded by ghost-like soul suckers, patrolling the surrounding area. The fighter may sustain five hits of mothership cannons, meeting with the ghost means a certain death. The space fighter moves constantly forward, the player can only change the flight direction by turning the ship.</description>
