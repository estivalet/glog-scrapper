        <description>A compilation featuring two puzzle games following known concepts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cultivation&lt;/i&gt; follows the basic formula of  &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Puzznic"&gt;Puzznic&lt;/a&gt;. The player has to clear a level within a time limit by moving symbols of the same design left or right, taking into account possible ways in which they may fall if there is no space beneath them. When symbols of the same design come in contact with each other, they disappear. An editor for constructing levels is included.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chromatics&lt;/i&gt; is a standard falling blocks game based on the &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Columns"&gt;Columns&lt;/a&gt; concept. Different colored blocks need to be arranged into sequences (horizontally or vertically) of at least three to make them disappear. If the player isn't successful, the number of blocks stack until the top, at which point the game is over. The number of colors in play can be adjusted from three to five.
