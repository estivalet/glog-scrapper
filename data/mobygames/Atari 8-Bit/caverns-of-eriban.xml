        <description>You are the pilot of a mine supply ship and it is your task to deliver supplies to various amount of subterranean mining depots scattered deep in the &lt;i&gt;Caverns of Eriban&lt;/i&gt;. Picking up five supplies and re-fuelling your ship on one of five landing strips on the surface at the entrance to the caverns, you must negotiate the passages to deliver your goods. As you explore the caverns looking for the depots you must avoid or shoot various obstacles and if you touch these obstacles or the walls then you lose one of eight lives. You also need to take account of the momentum of the craft as you move it with the joystick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The depots are represented by a small tower and each has a flashing light with red indicating it requires supplies while green means it's has supplies. You land your ship on a small landing strip next to the tower but land too fast and the ship is destroyed. Once you have delivered five supplies or your fuel is getting low then you have to make your way back to the surface and pick up five more to deliver.</description>
