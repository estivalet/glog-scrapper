        <description>It's January 1, 2050, and after many decades of research and development of space travel, mankind is ready to reach out to the planets of the solar system to establish mining bases. Up to four players compete with each other and the computer to stake valuable mining claims throughout the solar system, while the mining council has stationed patrol ships throughout the system to make sure everyone follows the rules. Thus begins several weeks of intensive exploration, political maneuvering, sabotage, and claim jumping which will decide the course of the economic exploitation of outer space for the next hundred years. You have the opportunity to guide your family to a commanding economic position in the solar system. The game can also be played solitaire against the computer.</description>
