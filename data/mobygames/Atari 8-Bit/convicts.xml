        <description>&lt;i&gt;The Convicts&lt;/i&gt; is a labyrinth game. The game offers fun for two players on a split screen mode. In a galaxy far away lived creatures called Snows. They held the Power Gem. The Lord of the Non-existence called Akron attacked the planet. The crystal shattered into thousands of pieces. Invasion survived two Snows. Their mission is to collect all the shards scattered around the maze of traps and restoration of life on the planet.
