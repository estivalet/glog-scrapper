        <description>Your civilization is under attack, and it's down to you and your &lt;i&gt;Laser Hawk&lt;/i&gt; helicopter to put things right. Destroy the five bases belonging to Proc Irata. They have sent their full fleet of ships to intercept you - shoot to destroy, and avoid those bullets. The centres are increasingly well-defended, with bombs, missiles and meteors among the threats. Many upward-shooting ground targets are destructible, but beware of the trees they are interspersed with. You have limited fuel, but fuel stocks hang through the air - contact with these triggers a refuel.</description>
