        <description>Action Quest is an action adventure game akin to &lt;a href="/game/venture"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;. The player controls a ghost whose objective is to traverse different rooms and collect treasure while solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles such as traps and monsters, often making use of the ghostâs ability to shoot projectiles. The game features 30 rooms and 20 treasures. There is a time limit in each room and if the player fails to fulfill the objectives under the allotted time, the ghost dies.</description>
