        <description>&lt;i&gt;Tecno Ninja&lt;/i&gt; is a sci-fi arcade game. As a ninja the player must reach the final chamber of each level and defeat the stage boss. Apart from running and jumping, the ninja may use fists to fight encountered enemies and destroy selected objects, which can hide a variety of useful items, especially keys, extra lives or coins. Keys are required to open the doors blocking inaccessible parts of the level. The number of keys equals the number of doors, therefore it is very important to find all the keys. This means basically the necessity of breaking all the objects and overcome adversaries. Energy deducted by encountered opponents and obstacles (electric barriers, spikes and others) may be supplemented by collecting energy boosters and extra life hearts. </description>
