        <description>&lt;i&gt;Lords of Conquest&lt;/i&gt; is influenced by the boardgame &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Risk"&gt;Risk&lt;/a&gt;. You and your opponent start by selecting countries in turn from a map. This can be randomly generated based on requested numbers of countries and volumes of water, chosen from one of the 19 predefined ones, or created using the inbuilt editor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your army possesses infantry, cavalry and a water fleet. Natural or produced resources such as gold and iron are identified - countries containing these might be the best ones to invade.You can play at 4 skill levels, and decide how big a factor luck is. With calculations settled by the computer, players can concentrate on the power games.</description>
