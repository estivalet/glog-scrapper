        <description>&lt;i&gt;PÅÃ­zrak nuly&lt;/i&gt; is an action arcade game. The player controls a little spaceship in a maze. His task is to find all 1-coins. He has to avoid floating 0 during the game as it costs him life. He should also avoid crashing into walls, houses or other objects. The map consists of 30 screens divided into 5 environments that differ in colour. Ludwig van Beethoven's FÃ¼r Elise is used as music.</description>
