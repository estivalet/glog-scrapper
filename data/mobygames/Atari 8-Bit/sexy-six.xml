        <description>&lt;i&gt;Sexy Six&lt;/i&gt; is a puzzle-board game. The player's task is to guess the sequence of four images in eight attempts. At the bottom of the screen there are four envelopes. For each of the envelopes the player may assign one image out of eight. The results of the trials are shown on the right side of the screen: bright color is a perfect match, darker color means that the image occurs in a different place.</description>
