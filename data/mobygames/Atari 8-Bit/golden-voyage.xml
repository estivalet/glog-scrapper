        <description>The 12th and final adventure in the main Scott Adams series, and most likely the one with the fewest packaging variations as well!  The king is ill, and only YOU can save him.  You must retrieve a magic elixir from a far away land, before it is too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this game, you take to the seas and journey through magic lands with temples, magic fountains, and more.  Although this is the last of the main series, it still uses the same basic 2-word parser.</description>
