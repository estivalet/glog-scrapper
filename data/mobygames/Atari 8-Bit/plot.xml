        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Plot&lt;/i&gt; you take the part of a round head, with curly golden locks cropped close to the scalp, in a cell that has a penchant for matching symbols on tiles. Your red head will move vertically on the right side of the cell while holding a tile to you left. This tile will show a symbol on it. The symbol will match with tiles on the other side of the cell. Your goal is to shove the tile across the room and match it with tiles that share its symbol. Once you destroy a tile you'll receive a new tile, more specifically, a tile that matches one near or behind the one(s) you destroyed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can attack the tiles directly from the right or ricochet them off an angle in the ceiling. Another devious trick up your sleeve is the lightning tile. This tile with its lightning design can mimic any other. If it touches another tile it will act as if the correct image has touched it and booth shall explode.</description>
