        <description>&lt;i&gt;Six-Gun Shootout&lt;/i&gt; is a turn-based strategy game of man-to-man combat, using the setting of the American West in the 19th century. It offers ten scenarios which can be played against the computer or a human opponent. The scenarios are loosely based on historical situations, like the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, or entirely fictional. Some are based on movies, for example the 1959 released &amp;quot;Rio Bravo&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The characters engaging each other are split into two factions called &amp;quot;Good Guys&amp;quot; and Bad Guys&amp;quot;, and are rated in different categories, such as their accuracy with weapons. It's possible to play a customized character. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game's tactical combat engine has features such as line-of sight, postures, terrain and wound effects, and includes 18 weapons with different attributes. A scenario is won by the player with the most victory points, which are accumulated by killing or incapacitating opposing individuals. It's possible for a side to be completely wiped out, yet be the winner through this system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
