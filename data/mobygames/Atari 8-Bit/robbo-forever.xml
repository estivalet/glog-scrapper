        <description>&lt;i&gt;Robbo Forever&lt;/i&gt; is a side-scrolling puzzle solving action game, similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash"&gt;Boulder Dash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Sokoban"&gt;Sokoban&lt;/a&gt;. The game is a partially fan made (levels design) commercial enhanced remake of &lt;a href="/game/robbo"&gt;Robbo&lt;/a&gt;, released exactly 20 years earlier. The game features a new set of 59 levels, new main menu, title screen and music. The game is available as freeware (atr &amp;amp; xex files) on the developer's site and as a commercial boxed collector's edition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player controls a robot, named Robbo. His goal is to collect all the screws on the planet needed to repair the ship, and reach his flying capsule, avoiding alien forms of life and numerous traps. The player will encounter many obstacles on their way, for example chests that will have to be moved properly, closed doors requiring finding the key, deadly cannons or electromagnets attracting metal objects. Robbo can use a gun after finding ammunition, use bombs placed on the board, and travel through teleporters.</description>
