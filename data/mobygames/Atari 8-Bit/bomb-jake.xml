        <description>&lt;i&gt;Bomb Jake&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade action game, a clone of &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Bomb+Jack"&gt;Bomb Jack&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Tehkan+Ltd"&gt;Tehkan Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;. The main character of the game is Jack. His task is to collect all the bombs on the board, avoiding the movement paths of the numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs. The game features a few power-ups in the form of hexagons with a specific letter in (f.e. E - an extra life, P turns the enemies into tokens, B - doubles the gained points for collecting bombs). The only weapon of the Jake is the short and long jumping ability combined with a perfect timing when trying to find a gap between the enemies.</description>
