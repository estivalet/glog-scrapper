        <description>&lt;i&gt;Cosmic Hero&lt;/i&gt; is a timed futuristic game using &lt;moby game="Sokoban"&gt;Sokoban&lt;/i&gt; concept. The spacecraft carrying a substance required to save the Earth from ecological disaster has crashed. The player's task is to gather up all the vials in each cabin of the shuttle. Opening the door to the next level requires repairing the electrical system. Spare wires must be moved and placed in the proper sequence, taking into account obstacles, such as the reversal of the direction of movement (joystick) or objects blocking the road. Finding a floppy disk moves immediately to the next level, while a computer adds one life. </description>
