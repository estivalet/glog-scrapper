        <description>&lt;i&gt;Tech&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Light+Cycle+games"&gt;'Light Cycle' game &lt;/a&gt; for two human players. The good one is the lord of the system and the evil one - the Tech program. The aim depends on the selected side - defending the world against viruses or takeover of the entire IT infrastructure. Each player drives around the board leaving a solid trail behind. The collision with the trail or the board edge means a loss of the game.</description>
