        <description>&lt;i&gt;Zombies&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game in which the protagonist has to fight the titular monsters, snakes, spiders, and an array of other creatures in order to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dungeons the hero must traverse make use of visual effects, similar to those found in &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,329366/"&gt;M. C. Escher's&lt;/a&gt; work, to create physically impossible scenarios. These structures serve as a basis for puzzles which must be solved in-between the fighting in order to proceed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game features a total of 13 dungeons with 129 different rooms. A cooperative mode with another player is also included.</description>
