        <description>&lt;i&gt;Word Hanger&lt;/i&gt; is the computer version of the classic pen and paper game designed exclusively for the Atari 8-bit, and it is a 1-2 player game in which you have to guess a random word letter by letter. If you guess correctly, that letter will be revealed. If not, part of the platform or man will appear on screen. Get enough incorrect guesses and you will see the man hanged and the answer will be given out. For a two-player game, one player looks away while the other enters their own word (done by pressing the [Esc] key at any time during the game) and whoever looked away has to guess it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </description>
