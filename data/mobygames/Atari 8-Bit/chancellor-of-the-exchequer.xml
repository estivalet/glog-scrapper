        <description>&lt;i&gt;Chancellor Of The Exchequer&lt;/i&gt; is an economic simulation in which the player takes the role of the financial and economic minister of Britain. The game begins in 1805, i.e. at the beginning of the industrial revolution. The player manages the production in the eight provinces; the goal being to industrialize them in order to make the country a big player and increase the population. If a province is advanced enough, it will merge with Great Britain which simplifies the administration. The game is almost completely text based and all time is spent in menus in which the player makes production and resource distribution choices.</description>
