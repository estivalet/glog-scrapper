        <description>&lt;i&gt;Rock-Ola's Nibbler&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade game that plays like a mix of &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Pac-Man"&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/a&gt; and Snake. The player controls Nibbler, a snake, through a maze and has to collect all the dots. To complete a level all dots have to be consumed. As they are the length of Nibbler increases and things get harder since a life is lost when the snake collides with its own body. There is also a time limit so the player can't take too long. For each new level the speed increases so the player has to plan his route since there is little time for decision making. The player has five lives and when they are all gone it's game over. A new life is earned after every fourth level. Points are earned for each dot collected and the amount of points increase with each new level. Bonus points are awarded based on how much time is left.</description>
