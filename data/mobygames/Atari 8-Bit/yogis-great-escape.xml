        <description>Yogi Bear has woken from his hibernation and is now searching his home, Jellystone Park for Picnic Baskets brought by tourists. On one search, Yogi over hears an awful telephone conversation with Ranger Smith that the Park is closing and all animals must be caught and transferred to a zoo. Not wanting to live in a cage or enclosure, Yogi has decided to escape and thus the beginning of his adventure. You have to guide Yogi over six levels (ending in New York) keeping ahead of a tracker and his dog. You must complete each level in 2 minutes 40 seconds or it is game over. On the way there are obstacles like holes and water,  as well as other characters to get in your way. Touching these loses one of  three lives. Scattered over the levels are various food items which will give you 100 points as well as invisible ones giving 250 points. If you want a bigger score then on certain levels you can collect six items which reward you with 7500 points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yogi's Great Escape&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game where you move Yogi from left to right with the screen scrolling when you move. </description>
