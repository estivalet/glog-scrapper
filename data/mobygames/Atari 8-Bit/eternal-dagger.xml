        <description>This sequel to SSI's &lt;a href="/game/wizards-crown"&gt;Wizard's Crown&lt;/a&gt; plays very much like the original. It's a fantasy RPG where you assemble a party of adventurers and explore a map.  In this game, the world is being invaded by Demons coming in from a portal to another dimension, and your job is to find the one item that can seal the portal, The Eternal Dagger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like &lt;i&gt;Wizard's Crown&lt;/i&gt;, this game is notable for its detailed, tactical combat system. There was also a &amp;quot;quick combat&amp;quot; mode if you didn't want to spend the time in the tactical mode, allowing you to focus more on conventional RPG features such as exploration.</description>
