        <description>&lt;i&gt;Sea Horse Hide'n Seek&lt;/i&gt; is an educational action game for children. 1 or 2 players can participate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to help a little seahorse to get to the shipwreck at the far right of the screen, while avoiding lagoon-fishes which try to take the seahorse out of the screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seahorse can hide in tunnels, automatically bringing the seahorse to a different location. However, there is always an octopus hiding in a cave. The seahorse can also hide in corals, as long as they match the seahorse's colour.</description>
