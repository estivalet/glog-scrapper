        <description>&lt;i&gt;Lancelot&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game. The player assumes the role of a green gnome, named Lancelot. His task is to find the legendary Holy Grail, hidden somewhere in the neighborhood of the Knights of the Round Table castle. The castle and its surroundings are inhabited by hostile creatures and various traps. Collision with an enemy or a trap leads to the loss of energy. Lancelot may find many treasures, keys needed to open the numerous doors and extra energy power-ups.</description>
