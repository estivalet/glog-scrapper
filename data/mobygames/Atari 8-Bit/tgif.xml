        <description>&lt;i&gt;T.G.I.F.&lt;/i&gt; (abbreviation for &amp;quot;Thank God It's Friday&amp;quot;) is a board\party video game for 1-4 players. If chosen 1 player the computer (called &amp;quot;Atari&amp;quot;) will play against you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goal of the game is to get a certain amount of cash. You can choose between 10000$ - 90000$ USD as a set goal and you can get cash by winning the lottery, spend your money in investments and payday checks, withdrawal from the bank, or tax refunds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; has all the 7 days of the week, each with its own certain bonuses or penalties, depending on the day:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monday: You lose money due to a certain circumstance. Either because you had to pay the doctor, or because you bought new clothes.
Tuesday: Lottery day. Find out if any of the numbers you have will grant you money. For getting numbers you have to buy lottery tickets first.
Wednesday: Either you get a bonus to your payday check, a tax refund, or withdraw money from the bank.
Thursday: ??? = That means Thursday is &amp;quot;Random Day&amp;quot;. Either you go to the lottery, have a treasure hunt, or have an investment opportunity.
Friday: The reason why the game is called &amp;quot;T.G.I.F.&amp;quot;. Payday. Get your payday check! Starts at 1000$ , but you can get more money from Wednesday's payday check bonus.
Saturday: Time to go for a treasure hunt! Dig on the map to find the treasure, arrows will help you. If you don't find the treasure a certain amount of moves you will have to pay money.
Sunday: Lazy Day. You do nothing and just relax. Sometimes a buyer for your investment will come or you can do a treasure hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also the field &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot;, where you invest money to buy a car, boat, or land. After a time, or if you hit Sunday or Thursday, a buyer will come and offer you a higher sum of money than the one you paid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are in the red you have to pay a loan to continue.</description>
