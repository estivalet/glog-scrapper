        <description>This game puts you in the position of a driver of a high-performance car participating, as the name implies, in races between U.S. cities. Noteworthy features of the game include a multitude of weather and road conditions (fog, snow, road construction), day/night changes (complete with smooth twilight transitions) and the ability to plan individual route to beat competition to the destination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additional features, that this game was among the first to boast, are sequential manual transmission, refuelling, traffic and police pursuits. The graphical presentation is pseudo-3D perspective with behind the car view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
