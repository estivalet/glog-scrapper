        <description>&lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,488206/"&gt;Sue Townsend&lt;/a&gt; created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd idea for a computer game, but &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Level+9+Computing%2c+Ltd%2e"&gt;Level 9&lt;/a&gt; felt that there was an adventure in there.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to other events unfolding. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible.</description>
