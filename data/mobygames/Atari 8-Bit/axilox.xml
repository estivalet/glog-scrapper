        <description>&lt;i&gt;Axilox&lt;/i&gt; is a two-player board game. The game board is a picture covered with 81 tiles; each tile has a number on it, dark or fair in color. The players, in turns, remove tiles; the first player removes a tile from the topmost row; the second player can only remove a tile from the same column as the tile just removed; the first player then can only remove the tile from the same row as that tile; and so on. Removing a tile with a fair number increases the player's score by the number, while removing a dark tile decreases the score. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game ends once the entire board is cleared, or when a player cannot make a move. The player with the higher score is the winner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one-player game involves the human player competing with a computer opponent, trying to keep winning throughout 10 levels with 5 different pictures. The two-player game is a single match. </description>
