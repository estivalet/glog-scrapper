        <description>Blue Thunder is a side-scrolling shooter and tie-in with the short-lived TV series of the same name which has you piloting a new 'jetcopter' as the only survivor of an alien assault.
As it turns out, you're not alone after all, so you depart from your ship and fly across a sea full of heavily defended islands to reach the enemy stronghold, disable its defenses and rescue your comrades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should you succeed, you get to try it again at a higher difficulty level, where you'll face enemies with higher firing rates, planes, barrage balloons and missile-armed submarines. All the while you'll have to keep an eye on your dwindling fuel supply. Your jetcopter can fire at any angle it's flying, even straight down.</description>
