        <description>As the adventurer Brian Hammerhand you have to defeat the Wizard Morloc the Mad in his Tower. The towers stairways comprise Rooms 1-6. With the exception of the ground floor, which has been assigned the next several room numbers, rooms with odd numbers are on Floors 1, 3, and 5, and rooms with even numbers are on Floors 2, 4, and 6. The higher the number, the higher the floor on which the room is located. While your journey you meet many bad creatures and you will find some magic and helpful treasures.</description>
