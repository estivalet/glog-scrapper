        <description>Robin Hood is at it again. In this side-scrolling action game he has to use his bow to vanquish the troops of evil Sheriff, collect treasure and kiss the beautiful Maid Marian.  The only location featured in the game is Sherwoodâs Forest. However, enemies respawn so thereâs no lack of things to shoot. Robin Hood can also climb anything that is of brown color.</description>
