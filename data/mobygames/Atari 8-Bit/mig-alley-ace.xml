        <description>&lt;i&gt;MiG Alley Ace&lt;/i&gt; is an action-based simulation of air combat during the Korean War. The titular MiG Alley was the area over North Korea near the Chinese border where the world's first large-scale jet-to-jet air battles took place, with, among others, the American F-86 Sabre facing off against the Soviet MiG-15 Fagot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is similar to MicroProse's earlier simulations &lt;a href="/game/hellcat-ace"&gt;Hellcat Ace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/game/spitfire-ace"&gt;Spitfire Ace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;MiG Alley Ace&lt;/i&gt; differs in that it offers a two-player mode via split screen. Five different scenarios based on actual encounters from the war are available. Each can be played solo, cooperatively or head-to-head. The goal in each scenario is to shoot down as many of the enemy planes as possible before the own squadron is destroyed. If a player's plane is destroyed but other craft from their squadron remain, they take control over one of the surviving planes. A scenario can result in a victory or loss for either side (or a neutral result in case the time limit expires). What the result is depends on a number of factors - while a destroyed enemy plane always nets victory points, the enemy might not be punished for it if the pilot bailed out or ditched the plane. Losing a scenario deducts from the player's lives: too many losses means the game has to be restarted.</description>
