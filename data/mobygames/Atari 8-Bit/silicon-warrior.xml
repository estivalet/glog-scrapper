        <description>Make a time journey into the year 2084. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The SYBORGS, a superhuman race of Technocrates, developed a computer of the 10th generation. A computer with more RAM and more artificial intelligence as all other computers built by the mankind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The SYBORGS swore to tell the secret, which is connected with this computer, to the best and greatest computer developer of the mankind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The managers of all prominent computer companies sent their best developers to this future war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have to fight against each other. One against the other one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the best can experience the secret of the SYBORGS.
