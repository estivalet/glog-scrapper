        <description>This is a single player rescue game involving a population relocation for survival. The population in need is being attacked by Fraxullan Slimehordes and require movement  around an active volcano and registered into the City of New Hope, on the opposite side of the volcano. These people are in danger of being dropped into the flaming volcano by the Slimehordes. The player is piloting his Needlefighter and is required to hook each individual and fly them to New Hope. Upon arrival the evacuee has to be carefully placed so as not to crush already arrived individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the entire population is safely removed and are registered into New Hope, then they are placed into the Verdann Fortress. As the last citizen has been placed there, the gates of Verdann Fortress can be closed against both the Hordes, and the Volcano. The lava flows engulf the city of New Hope.</description>
