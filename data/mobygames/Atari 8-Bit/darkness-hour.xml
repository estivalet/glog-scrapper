        <description>&lt;i&gt;Darkness Hour&lt;/i&gt; is a timed action platform game. The goal of the player is to find the designated number of butterflies before the end of the night. On each level the player may find the limited number of keys necessary to open the doors. Some of the doors lead to a blind alley, incorrect usage of the keys ends up with a game over message. The passing of the time limit finishes the game automatically, no matter how many lives remaining. The game features a total of three levels with a system of teleports, transferring to other parts of the maze. Shaman-like enemies may be killed by using unlimited throwing knives, contact with them or with the sharp spikes means a certain death.</description>
