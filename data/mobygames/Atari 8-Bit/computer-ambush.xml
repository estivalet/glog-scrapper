        <description>Computer Ambush (Improved Version) is a computer tactical simulation of squad vs squad combat in France during World War II. You are a Sergeant and command a squad of 10 infantrymen (either American or German). Each man has a name, personal background (dossier), and comes rated with individual critical combat skills. You can also rate the soldiers to your own specifications for more flexibility. Computer Ambush is played as a series of turns until either one side is destroyed or one or both sides have completed their missions.The game can be played as two player ( 7 scenarios) or computer as opponent (5 scenarios). The game is advanced level and takes 1 -3 hours to complete.</description>
