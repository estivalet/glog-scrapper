        <description>&lt;i&gt;Magia&lt;/i&gt; (Magic) is a Polish adventure game in which the player controls the knight Alakhin, transformed into a ghost via evil magic. To escape the chambers he's imprisoned within, the player needs to find the wizard Or Kirr and bring him the proper artifacts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay is presented in isometric perspective. Most of the screen is taken up by the view of the chamber Alakhin is inside. At the bottom of the screen is a percentage that shows how far the player has progressed in the game, and a clock which shows how much time has been spent playing so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some chambers have objects (treasure chests, windows, paintings, shields) or people inside them. These can be interacted with by pointing to them with the cursor and pressing &amp;quot;Fire&amp;quot;; this will cause a menu with various commands to appear. Usually chests, windows or shields have items hidden within that can be picked up, while people can be given items. Note that up to four items can be carried in the player's inventory. Sometimes &amp;quot;spells&amp;quot; can be found; using these will show a map of the game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter another chamber, one points to a doorway, presses &amp;quot;Fire&amp;quot; and chooses the &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; option. </description>
