        <description>It is the year 2500 and the galaxy has been at peace for many years. Until now! A fleet of planet pulverizers has invaded the sector of the galaxy under your command. Reports are telling you of a massive wave of destruction. It is up to you to rid the universe of this threat of utter destruction. &lt;i&gt;Conflict 2500&lt;/i&gt; is a strategic simulation of conflict in the 26th century. The game can be played solitary or with up to 10 other players by giving command of ships to individuals. The computer controls a fleet of planet pulverizers and adapts its strategy to your actions. The game can be stopped during play or can continue until one side or the other is destroyed.</description>
