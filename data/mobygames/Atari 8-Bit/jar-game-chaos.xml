        <description>&lt;i&gt;The Jar Game &amp;amp; Chaos&lt;/i&gt; includes two educational games:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Jar Game&lt;/i&gt;: The game presents the player with two jars which include a different amount of bonbons (green) and lumps of sugar. The player controls a fly and needs to enter one of the jars and land on a piece of sugar. The game's goal is to teach the kid to recognise which jar has the biggest probability of success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chaos&lt;/i&gt;: The player is presented with a field which contains a number of different shapes and colours. The game specifies a shape and colour and the player needs to catch as many identical items by moving a space ship over the field. During the game, the target may be changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
