        <description>By 1989 Kenny Dalglish scarcely played for Liverpool, and was almost entirely concentrating on his role as manager, so a football management game with no arcade action featuring his license made sense. The game is purely icon- and menu-driven, perhaps the first step in dragging the genre into the 90s. Whichever team you took charge of start from the 4th division. Match highlights can be selected - these are viewed from the side and show goals and near-misses, although they can be turned off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You start with squads of over 20 players from which to choose your team of 11, each given a straightforward ability rating. Formations can be selected by placing each player in a precise position alongside the formation of the opposition team, using a fairly advanced system for the time. Via a separate menu you can consult with the chairman (to see if he's happy with your efforts), the physio (to check for injuries), the scout (who comes up with players you might like to purchase) and so on.</description>
