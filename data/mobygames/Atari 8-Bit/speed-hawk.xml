        <description>One hundred years ago your ancestors defeated a powerful force of space pirates to secure a new beginning for the humans who are inhabiting the planet Tintagel 4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, a century later, space pirates want to attack the ring worlds surrounding Tintagel 4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a direct descendant of the legendary hero &amp;quot;Speedhawk&amp;quot;, it is your task to stop them by infiltrating their motherships and destroy the mutant guardians (which serve as bosses) at the end of each level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hostile space fighters and turrets will try to protect their motherships, but if you manage to destroy a space fighter it might give you a power-up.
But be warned as they can also be shot and will be destroyed. They also might fly away if you don't collect them in time.</description>
