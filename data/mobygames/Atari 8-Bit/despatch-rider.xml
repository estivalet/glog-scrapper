        <description>&lt;i&gt;Despatch Rider&lt;/i&gt; is a side-scrolling arcade game. The goal of the player is to make as much money as possible in twelve hours (from 7:00 till 19:00) by collecting packages from one part of the city and delivering them to the final customer. The main screen is divided into a map of the whole city with current weather, road window and indicators display panel (earned money, remaining time, remaining fuel). The rainy weather may affect the brakes' functionality, therefore speed should be adjusted to the conditions on the road. The player can refuel at one of the four gas stations in exchange for a fee. Fuel stations are shown only for two seconds each game. Crashing the bike into a kerb results in the loss of 30 minutes, crashing into a skip results in loss of carrying package. Collecting packages dropped from the window requires catching them before they fall to the ground. The package is delivered by throwing it through the open doors.</description>
