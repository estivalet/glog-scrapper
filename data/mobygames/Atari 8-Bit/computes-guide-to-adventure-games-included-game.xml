        <description>In this demonstration game, whose type-in source code is included in the book to demonstrate text adventure game programming, the player must venture into a defunct factory tower (based on a real building in Manchester, NH) in hopes of retrieving magnetic media on which is stored a copy of Crowther &amp;amp; Woods' inaugural adventure game, &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Adventure+versions"&gt;ADVENTURE&lt;/a&gt;.  Typical text adventure adversaries of vermin and small animals interfere with the efforts, and must be overcome through the solving of standard text adventure puzzles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three versions of this game's source code are included in the book, for Microsoft BASIC, modified Microsoft BASIC for Atari computers, and for TI BASIC.</description>
