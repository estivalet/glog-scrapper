        <description>&lt;i&gt;The Great War 1914&lt;/i&gt; is a turn-based strategy game set during the beginning months of World War I. It covers the time period between August and October (27 turns which represent three days each) and Europe between Paris-Minsk and Antwerp-Vienna. Players either takes the role of the Western Allies (France, Great Britain, Belgium), Central Powers (Germany, Bavaria, Austria-Hungary) or Russia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each turn is divided into three phases: strategic movement, tactical orders and the resolution after all sides gave their orders. Each unit has a zone of control (the squares around it) which restricts enemy movements. Other important aspects are special environment squares which influence the units (e.g. they can't move in rivers), forts (a major strategic factor) and railroads. The winner is determined with victory points: there are 50 special squares which give points to the faction which owns it (determined by the last unit which moved through it in a tactical move).</description>
