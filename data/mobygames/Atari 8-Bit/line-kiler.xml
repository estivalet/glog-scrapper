        <description>&lt;i&gt;Line Kiler&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade 'Light Cycle' game. The game allows two human players to compete on a single screen at the same time. Each player guides a line around the game board leaving a solid trail behind them. The main purpose of the game is to cause another player to crash into the trails, obstacles or the edge of the game area. The winner is the player who accumulates four wins in a row.
