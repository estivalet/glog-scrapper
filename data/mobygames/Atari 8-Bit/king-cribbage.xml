        <description>Cribbage is a card game that has been popular for centuries.  In this adaptation, you compete against the computer in a standard game trying to beat your opponent to a score of 121.  Points are scored according to standard cribbage rules:
The game gives you a beginner play mode where the computer scores all points for both of you, or an advanced mode &lt;i&gt;(Muggins)&lt;/i&gt; where you each score your own hand and can claim any points missed by your opponent (calling Muggins).
