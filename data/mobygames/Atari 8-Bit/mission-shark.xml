        <description>&lt;i&gt;Mission Shark&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game where a covert agent is trying to find four canisters within an enemy base. The goal of the game is to find them all and make it to the exit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving around the game world, the agent must watch out for enemy soldiers, landmines, electric fields and defense turrets. Getting shot or touched by those hazards results in losing health, which can be replenished by collecting the appropriate power-up. The agent is armed with a gun and some grenades; ammo is limited, but more of it can be found. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A mini-map at the bottom right shows the agent's position within the base, as well as the areas he's already visited. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game was originally released in 1990 as part of a &lt;a href="/game/misjafred"&gt;compilation&lt;/a&gt;. </description>
