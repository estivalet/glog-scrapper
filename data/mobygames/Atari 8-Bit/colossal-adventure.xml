        <description>&lt;i&gt;Colossal Adventure&lt;/i&gt; takes its cue from &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Adventure+versions"&gt;the very earliest mainframe text adventures&lt;/a&gt;. Our hero must rescue the elves and find fifteen pieces of treasure. There are many dark areas, so lights and batteries are at a premium. Be careful of vicious dwarves, who can be killed using axes. You can carry up to four objects at a time; the useful ones include a newspaper, keys and sandwiches. The vocabulary includes saying spell names, DROPping items to stay within the carrying limit (and for other specific reasons), CATCHing a bird, and standard directions plus IN and OUT.</description>
