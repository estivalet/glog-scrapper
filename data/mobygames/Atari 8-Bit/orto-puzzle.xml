        <description>&lt;i&gt;Orto Puzzle&lt;/i&gt; is an educational game for kids. The player's task is to choose the correct spelling of Polish words. The correct missing letter need to be selected from different choices indicated at the bottom of the screen by using the up or down cursor keys (or joystick direction). The player has ten seconds to make a decision. The game underlines the missing letters of the word the player needs to decide on. For the appropriate number of correct answers (30) the player gets the reward image of a character from a cartoon (256 colors). On the left side of the screen the game shows the number of answers needed to uncover the reward picture and the good answers indicator, on the right side - the bad answers indicator.</description>
