        <description>Guide Flip Ogart, a continually bouncing blob-like creature, through several maze-like dungeons in order to rescue all the other Ogarts that have been captured by the evil RotogartEatos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These dungeons aren't just all bare, stone walls, though - you'll have to contend with plenty of RotogartEatos patrolling the corridors, invisible walls, teleports, harmless blowers, deadly suckers, and switches that reverse everything's direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebound is a type-in game from the January 1987 issue of ANTIC magazine, one of a long line of very popular BASIC games by J.D. Casten that were published by ANTIC. </description>
