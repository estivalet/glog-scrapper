        <description>The head of the Circle of Enchanters is a brave hero, the same one who has defeated the evil Krill and solved the mystery of the Necromancer Belboz. However, now an even greater threat has appeared: the very foundations of the art of Magic seem to be failing! The Guilds organize a great assembly to discuss the alarming waning of Magic; suddenly, a mysterious shadowy figure casts a spell that transforms everyone to toads and newts - everyone but the intrepid leader of the Circle, who must commit his most heroic deeds yet, solving the hardest mystery of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The concluding part of the &lt;i&gt;Enchanter&lt;/i&gt; trilogy within the &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Zork"&gt;Zork universe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/i&gt; is a sequel to &lt;a href="/game/sorcerer"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;. The game plays similarly to its predecessors, the player inputting text commands to interact with the game world and solve puzzles. The magic system is still present; however, spellcasting can fail now, due to the game's premise of the decline of magic. A new feature is the player's ability to name the objects the protagonist collects in the game. This ability becomes a necessity when the player is required to collect the identically-looking Cubes of Foundation, having to name them in order to differentiate between them.</description>
