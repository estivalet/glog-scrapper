        <description>Gossip was an experimental game designed to model interactions between the player and between 3 and 7 computer players.  The player could influence other players by phoning them up and telling them whether they liked or disliked other players.  They could also pass information such as how much another player liked or disliked someone.  After making a series of 'Phone calls', the game would process the information and adjust the internal model with the player's goal to become the most popular player.</description>
