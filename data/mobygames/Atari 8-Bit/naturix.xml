        <description>&lt;i&gt;Naturix&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game mixed with an adventure game. Player has to find four boxes and a navigation tool. His task is not easy as the game world is pretty large (124 screens) and full of enemies. Player can kill enemies with laser shots but there is a limited amount of them. There are also places where player has to solve logic puzzles, such as tricking the temperature sensor or how to get through flooded room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story is set in a Solar System far from ours. There is a planet Naturland where Naturixes live. There is a base on a moon of Naturland that provides power supplies. The player character is sent there for supplies just to find out that it is controlled by hostile beings which makes his task very complicated...</description>
