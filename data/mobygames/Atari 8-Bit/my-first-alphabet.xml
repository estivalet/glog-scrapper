        <description>This is a program to teach children their alphabet and their numbers. When the program begins, the screen draws a clown, frowning, then the letters of the alphabet begin to appear on the screen while the alphabet song plays. You are then taken to the main menu. Here, you can have the screen show pictures for each letter of the alphabet and/or each number, zero through nine. There is also an option to select that will show a corresponding picture for whatever letter or number you press on the keyboard.</description>
