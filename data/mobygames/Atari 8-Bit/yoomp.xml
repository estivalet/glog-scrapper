        <description>&lt;i&gt;Yoomp!&lt;/i&gt; is the winner of the 2007 ABBUC software competition. 
Like a combination of &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Trailblazer"&gt;Trailblazer&lt;/a&gt; and an often-seen demoscene effect, you fall down a tube, landing on each square progressively in a rhythmic manner. Landing on certain tiles will have certain effects, such as making the screen quake, decreasing the brightness or forcing you to jump. Navigating the tube itself is a matter of planning ahead and compensating for your limited movement capabilities.
This game is freeware and can be downloaded on the Yoomp website.</description>
