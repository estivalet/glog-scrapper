        <description>20 themed words are arranged in criss-cross formation over the faces of a three-dimensional cube.  You have to guess and uncover them.  A mascot- The Wuzzle- apprises you of your progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When uncovering the words, you will get: a blank square- no points and the turn is over; a vowel- 5 points and another turn; a consonant- you get a question mark and must guess the letter- a correct guess nets 10 points and another turn, an incorrect guess -5 points and the turn is over.  There are also bonus squares that let you pick an extra square on the current cube-side, as well as one on another side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New word lists can be added by the user- ostensibly to allow children to practice their spelling homework.</description>
