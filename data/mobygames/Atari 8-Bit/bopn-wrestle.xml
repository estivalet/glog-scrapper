        <description>The company behind &lt;a href="/game/kung-fu-the-way-of-the-exploding-fist"&gt;Way of the Exploding Fist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/game/fighting-warrior"&gt;Fighting Warrior&lt;/a&gt; also tried its hand at wrestling, with this game claiming to be the first 3D combat sports game, in which you can avoid the opponent by moving up or down the screen as well as left or right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like any fighting game worth its salt, the game can be played with one or two players. In one-player mode there are 10 opponents to take on in sequence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moves on offer include almost everything you'd find in real wrestling (and I don't mean WWE) - piledrivers, arm twists, body slams and turnbuckle flies, all of which are fully animated. The whole experience includes detailed multi-colour graphics and a full rock soundtrack.</description>
