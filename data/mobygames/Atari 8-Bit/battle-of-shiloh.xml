        <description>A turn-based strategy wargame set at the dawn of the US civil war, recreating the first major clash between the Confederate army and Grant's forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is played from an hexagonal grid and divided on turns of movement and attack phases, with pre-defined units divided in regiments of different sizes and abilities. You can choose whether to lead the Confederate or Union forces and the game allows for single or &amp;quot;hot-seat&amp;quot; 2P-multiplayer modes.</description>
