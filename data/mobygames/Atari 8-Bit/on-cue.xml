        <description>&lt;i&gt;On Cue&lt;/i&gt; is a game allowing you to play either a game of 8-Ball Pool or Snooker against a friend or the computer which has various skill levels. The game is viewed from above with the whole table shown on the screen. The rules of both games are closely followed and the winner in snooker is the player with the most points while in pool it is the first person to pot their balls and the black ball.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To pot the ball in both games is to first position a cross where you want the white ball to go, a press of the fire button then allows you to adjust spin. Press the fire button again and a power bar appears and using left or right, you can adjust how hard you want to hit the white ball. Once your happy with your power, you press the button again and the shot is taken.</description>
