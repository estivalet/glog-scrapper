        <description>&lt;i&gt;Computer Quarterback&lt;/i&gt; is a real time strategy simulation of NFL football. There are three ways this game can be played. In the semi pro version, there are 18 offensive plays and 14 defensive plays. In the pro version, there are 36 offensive plays and 24 defensive plays. In the computer version, you play against the computer team called The Robots and this version plays the same was as the semi pro version. With this game you will have to name your own team and draft players with the money you start out with. There was an optional team disk you could order through the catalog that came with this game. The team disk has NFL teams you can choose from instead of creating your own.</description>
