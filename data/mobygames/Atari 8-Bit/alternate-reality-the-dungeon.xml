        <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate Reality: The Dungeon&lt;/i&gt; directly follows its &lt;a href="/game/alternate-reality-the-city"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;: The player is still captured by aliens and imprisoned in an alternate reality. After visiting the city, now he proceeds to the dungeon with only one goal in mind: surviving. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the predecessor was more about exploring the city, this installment has a largely linear path - the dungeon consists of four levels which have to be visited in order. But the surroundings don't mean that there are only monsters to fight in the turn-based combat system or treasure to loot: the player still has the shops, e.g. an inn or a smithy, to his disposal. Even the six 
guilds (plus two additional ones) found their way into the dungeon; this time the player even may become a member. An important change in gameplay is that all items have a weight associated with them - carrying too much is bad for speed and endurance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dungeon is separated from the city and after entering there is no turning back. Save games can be imported, but the player loses all potions but sixteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
