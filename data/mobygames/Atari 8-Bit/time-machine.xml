        <description>&lt;i&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/i&gt; is the second in the &lt;i&gt;Mysterious Adventure&lt;/i&gt; series of  text adventures by Brian Howarth.  You are a newspaper reporter, come to investigate the eccentric professor who lives all by himself out on the moors.  When you get there, you find the place deserted though.  Ultimately you must rescue the professor by finding 3 missing prisms which control his time machine, which are lost in time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the other games in the series, the game uses an interpreter similar to the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus also has the same limitations - a basic 2-word parser, limited vocabulary, and brief descriptions. Illustrations are included in Spectrum, C64, Dragon and Oric ports.</description>
