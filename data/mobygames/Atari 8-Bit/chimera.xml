        <description>A strange alien spacecraft has been discovered orbiting the Earth, it its weaponry primed and ready to destroy the planet. Your mission: To infiltrate the craft, disable the weapons, initiate the self-destruct sequence, and escape with your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chimera&lt;/i&gt; is an isometric adventure game set on an uninhabited space ship. The player must explore the ship, which is divided into a grid of rooms. There are various items scattered around the maze-like craft, which will be either a help or a hindrance. For example, food and water will keep the player alive, while radiators will quickly deplete water reserves while standing in the same room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only actions the player can perform are to move and to interact with objects. Many objects â such as electric fences, or the aforementioned radiators â are deadly to the touch unless the player has the correct item in their possession. The ultimate goal is to prime and activate the four-stage self destruct sequence in the correct order by using items found on the ship. A scrolling message indicator at the bottom of the screen provides useful status information.</description>
