        <description>You, Brian Hammerhand, mercenary at large, presently least senior officer of the cavalry troop, and drawer of the shortest straw, have the singular honor of undertaking this hazardous but glorious mission. Will you emerge victorious, carrying the 
sacred stones and the head of Rex the Reaver, or will you meet ignominious defeat, pierced through by a cold steel blade thrust from the shadows? The honor of the duchy is in your hands. A 2D text based RPG written in BASIC.</description>
