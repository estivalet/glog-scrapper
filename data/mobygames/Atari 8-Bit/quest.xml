        <description>A dragon is terrorizing the kingdom of Balema, and King Galt send his champion, named Gorn, to solve the problem. The player takes the role of a nameless advisor, who has to help the strong, but not very intelligent Gorn to get rid of the dragon and save his homeland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Quest&lt;/i&gt; was one of the first graphic adventures that incorporated full sentence parsing. Unlike most other adventures, the commands the player inputs do not refer to the playable character. Rather, as the playable character, the player gives those commands to Gorn. Instead of just entering short verb commands, the player is able to type relatively complex instructions, that have to be understood by Gorn in order to perform the necessary action.</description>
