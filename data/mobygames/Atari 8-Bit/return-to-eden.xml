        <description>The command robots of &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Snowball"&gt;Snowball&lt;/a&gt; have found the colonisable planet Eden, and already set about colonising this lush verdant planet. Not easy though - native plants and animals have adapted and fought back at the threat to their territory. A walled area now encloses the city, which is crumbling around you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Snowball 9 reaches the planet, Commander Kim Kimberley is filmed apparently committing a murder. As Kim, you must escape from the 'justice' of crazed robot droids. Snowball 9's landing is made dangerous due to the robots malfunctioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to Eden&lt;/i&gt; is an interactive fiction game which sets you as Kim, and challenges you to enter and survive within the robot city. Strange and surreal outcomes about - what do you get when you plant a brick? The world includes a bank, a theme park, the Corridors of Power, and a Starbike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Snowball"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, it features graphics, with over 200 illustrative pictures featured. adds the ability to type while the screen is updating. Vocabulary is simplified - a new IT command refers to the last-mentioned object, and clothing can be WEAR'ed without being GET'ted first.</description>
