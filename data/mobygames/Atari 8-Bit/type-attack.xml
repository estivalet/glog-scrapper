        <description>A Space Invaders inspired typing game. Letters slowly descend from the sky, type them in order to destroy them. Any letter that is at the bottom of a column is a valid input; mistakenly inputting another drains energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 99 speeds (Anything above 80 requires a genetic mutation), and 39 lessons. These can include upper and lower case, symbols and special keys as options. Each lesson finishes with a sequence of words using the featured letters, to be input in as little time as possible, allowing for use of the delete key.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Score is based on WPM, letters destroyed, minus mistakes. There is a savable high score table plus you can save your game at any time. The package includes finger placement diagrams for all variants of the host platform. </description>
