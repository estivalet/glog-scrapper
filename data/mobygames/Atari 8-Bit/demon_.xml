        <description>&lt;i&gt;Demon&lt;/i&gt; is a simple action-adventure game. The player moves through a maze, collecting one-use items along the way and using them in the right places, mostly to open underground passages. Movement is limited to walking, no jumping or ducking available. Contact with moving obstacles takes a certain amount of energy, which can be supplemented through the heart power up. The door opens by using the appropriate keys, campfire must be put out with a fire extinguisher and a wall with a dynamite stick.</description>
