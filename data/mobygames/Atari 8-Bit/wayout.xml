        <description>&lt;i&gt;Wayout&lt;/i&gt; is an early use of first-person 3D perspective, featuring a small gameplay window but smooth 360-degree movement. You are trapped inside one of 26 mazes (composed of 90-degree direction changes) and must find the exit. The game records how many movement units you use up, and saves the best scores to disk. Up to nine in-progress games can also be saved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have a compass and a map-making kit, enabling the game to automatically map the areas you explore. These can be stolen by the Cleptangle beast, but you can chase him to get them back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can't push against the wind without finding a special way of overcoming it. Fireflies automatically move with the wind, and can serve as a clue to its direction.</description>
