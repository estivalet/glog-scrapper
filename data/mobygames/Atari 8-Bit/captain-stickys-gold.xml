        <description>Captain Sticky has a big problem: He is all out of gum! To buy more, he requires gold which needs to be acquired by one of his crew mates. He puts on his diving suit and, controlled by the player, starts the search underwater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The non-scrolling screen is shown from the side and is mostly covered by water. At the bottom of the screen are platforms on which gold bars randomly appear. The player needs to navigate to the gold bar and use a rope on them (which happens automatically by touching them) so Captain Sticky can retrieve them. After every gold bar, it is necessary to reach the surface in order to get a new rope (which also refills the limited air supply). Other obstacles are enemies (the player character carries a harpoon which can be used to get rid of some), deadly force fields, bombs dropped by helicopters and an overall time limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After collecting ten bars the player moves on to a new of the overall eight levels which loop with a higher difficulty after beating all. The first eight difficulty levels can be chosen before starting a new game and the 32K version has a highscore list.</description>
