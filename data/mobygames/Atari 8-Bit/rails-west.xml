        <description>&lt;i&gt;Rails West!&lt;/i&gt; is a simulation game about the 19th century speculation in railroad financing. It allows for 1-8 players, with up to 4 under computer control. The long scenario starts in 1870 and ends after the 1900 turn (with 31 turns total). The short scenario starts in 1890 and ends either in 1895 (6 turns) or 1900 (11 turns). The objective is to accumulate cash, stocks and bonds and to control viable transcontinental railroads through strategical decisions.</description>
