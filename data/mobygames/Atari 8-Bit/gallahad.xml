        <description>&lt;i&gt;Gallahad&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure game. The game takes place in the castle and its surroundings. The main character of the game is Tristan. His task is to defeat the sorcerer named Saldar and save the kingdom. Tristan may carry up to five items. A large proportion of items in the game are unnecessary. The player must be careful what he collects because the items cannot be put down. An additional complication is the sorcerer's guards with whom contact means a loss of energy.</description>
