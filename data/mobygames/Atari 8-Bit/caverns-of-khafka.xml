        <description>&lt;i&gt;Caverns of Khafka&lt;/i&gt; is an action game inspired by &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Indiana+Jones"&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/a&gt; movies. The cover features gold, pharaohs and a tan pants clad protagonist missing only the trademark hat. The plot is familiar; facing the treacherous caverns of rolling boulders and deadly insects, you set out on a search for the five seals to unlock and raid the king's chambers. Be prepared for a trying time as the tools at your disposal include only your trusty grapple-action whip and gravity defying jump. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the original C-64 version features large sprites and 8-way scrolling the Atari XL version has levels that fit on one screen, a smaller player sprite reminding of &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=lode-runner"&gt;Loderunner&lt;/a&gt;, and different soundtrack.</description>
