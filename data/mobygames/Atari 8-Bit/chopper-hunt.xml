        <description>This is a redoing of &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=A%2eN%2eA%2eL%2eO%2eG%2e+Software"&gt;A.N.A.L.O.G. Software's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/game/buried-buck"&gt;Buried Buck$&lt;/a&gt;, with some changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are still a helicopter but now the treasure you are after looks different for each level. For example, level one you are after barrels of oil, level two is green money bags, level three is nuclear symbols (uranium, I suppose), etc. You must still bomb the ground to dig a hole to reach the treasures and the plane is still dropping giant clods of dirt to fill in the hole, and maybe bury you. When you gather a treasure, you must still land on your base to claim it. If you are destroyed before you return to base, you drop the treasure. You can only carry one treasure at a time. After you collect all the buried treasures, you move on to the next level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There background has also been spruced up. There are mountains, a cloud and a sun. The plane has been altered from a bomber to a fighter jet. &lt;i&gt;Chopper Hunt&lt;/i&gt;, unlike &lt;a href="/game/buried-buck"&gt;Buried Buck$&lt;/a&gt;, was also ported to the Commodore 64.</description>
