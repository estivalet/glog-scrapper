        <description>&lt;i&gt;Maze&lt;/i&gt; is a game created for the &amp;quot;NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014&amp;quot; competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goal is to get to the top-left corner of a randomly-generated maze. Once the goal is reached, the time taken to complete the maze is displayed, then the game restarts. At the beginning of the game, the player can choose either to have the maze stay on screen as it is explored, or to have only a small section of the maze displayed at one time. </description>
