        <description>On December 16, 1944 in the twilight of the Third Reich, Hitler played his last desperate gamble and launched a massive surprise assault against the thin allied lines in the Ardennes forest of Belgium and Luxemborg. As the German Commander your goal is to cross the Ardennes forest and get to the other side of the Meuse River. With division/regiment sized forces you must storm thru the allied forces taking as many towns as possible. If you choose to command the allied forces your goal is the same as the American commander in 1944. Hold out against the attacking germans until reinforcements arrive while keeping the enemy from taking towns and exiting from the map. The game lasts 15 turns. Each turn historically representing one day. The game can be played solitaire or against another individual.</description>
