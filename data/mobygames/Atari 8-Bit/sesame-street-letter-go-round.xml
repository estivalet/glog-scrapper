        <description>The &lt;i&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/i&gt; Muppets invite a child player for a spin on the &lt;b&gt;Letter-Go-Round&lt;/b&gt;!. By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel, children practice recognizing and matching letters, simple spelling and word formation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several types of game:&lt;br&gt;
 - Upper case matching; &lt;br&gt;
 - Lower case matching; &lt;br&gt;
 - Mixed case matching; &lt;br&gt;
 - One little word; &lt;br&gt;
 - What's missing?; &lt;br&gt;
 - Spell the secret word. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the start of each game, one of Muppet pets brings out a letter to match or word to spell and drops it on the seesaw. A letter appears on each ferris wheel bucket and as the Letter-Go-Round spins, child player should find the right letter to match or complete a word. Child may choose and try any letter, because there is no time limit to play. When a match is made or a word is completed, Muppet pets will dance and cheer a child player to the next round of play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is recommended for 1 player aged 3 to 4.</description>
