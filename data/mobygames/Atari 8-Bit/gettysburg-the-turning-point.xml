        <description>Gettysburg: The Turning Point is a grand tactical simulation of the most famous, well known and arguably the most decisive battle of the Civil War fought at the little town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from July 1 to July 3, 1863.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game uses a refined version of SSI's Antietam game system and is played in 42 turns each representing 1 hour of real time over a 3 day period.. Players are awarded points based on casualties and territorial objectives. At the end of each turn and the end of the game points are calculated and compared to a chart which determines your level of victory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game can be played under 3 different sets of rules (Basic, Intermediate and Advanced) with 5 levels of difficulty for each and can be played against another person or the computer can play either side.</description>
