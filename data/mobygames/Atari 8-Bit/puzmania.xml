        <description>&lt;i&gt;Puzmania&lt;/i&gt; is a cartoon style timed puzzle game. The game starts with five pictures to choose from. On each level a new image appears. The player chooses the image from pictures that keep rapidly changing. Each puzzle consists of a set of twenty parts. The bottom of the screen consists of time indicator and a belt with constantly moving puzzles. After selecting one piece the player must place it in the appropriate place on the board. For the remaining time the player receives bonus points. The game ends when the time runs out. The game saves the progress every five levels and thus the player does not have to start from scratch.</description>
