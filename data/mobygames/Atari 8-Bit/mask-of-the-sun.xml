        <description>You are Mac Steele - archeologist, adventurer and treasure hunter. Poisoned by one of your newly found artifacts, you're fighting against time to find the legendary Mask of the Sun, which is your only chance to find a cure.
On your trip you'll stumble across antique ruins of the Aztecs, burried deep within Mexico, which hold the secret of a long lost civilization.
Mask of the Sun is a classical text adventure with graphics of your surroundings.</description>
