        <description>&lt;i&gt;Inside&lt;/i&gt; is a side-scrolling action game for up to two players, based on the C64 game &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Chip-War"&gt;Chip-War&lt;/a&gt;. The player controls a ship placed inside the computer (on the main board) who has to repair all eight chips needed to supply the power to the computer. After finding the broken chip the player is transferred to the diagram board. The player must replace the damaged parts before time runs out. At any time the player can check the amount of remaining errors (T letter) or view the correct schema (S letter, costs 100 time units). Not repaired components results in loss of computer power. All damages affect the game itself, for example, damaged sound card distorts the music, damaged graphics card blurs the screen view, damaged joystick port interacts with steering the ship. Reaching the zero power level turns off the computer and ends the game.</description>
