        <description>For his own amusement, a Wizard has constructed a strange game inside his head. It takes place on a grid loaded with pieces of an Amulate, all of which must be collected. When you collect one, an arrow appears preventing you from moving back in that direction; failure to obey the Wizard sees him release a beast, which must be avoided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are the player in this forced 3D world. As well as Amulate pieces, there are also scrolls to collect - these produce spells which can be activated by typing the name. Spells include freezing the enemies, a level skip and a smart bomb. Other than the bomb, each one lasts for 20 seconds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Power Disks are activated once a screen is clear, and take you to the next one. Other hazardous creatures to avoid include the Kitz and the Nim, who kill you on contact.</description>
