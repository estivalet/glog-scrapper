        <description>Number 11 and final entry in the Mysterious Adventures series. You've spent a fun day at the local fair.  Now you decide to head over to the waxworks for some fun.  But you are tired.  You lie down for a snooze...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It turns out you are trapped in the Waxworks.  Is it all a dream though?   Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.</description>
