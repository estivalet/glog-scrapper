        <description>&lt;i&gt;Sexversi&lt;/i&gt; is a computer conversion of the popular two players board game reversi, also known as Othello. You can play against the computer with a choice of four skill levels or against a human player. The computer player is represented by four women. For every winning round the player uncovers one puzzle of a picture with naked opponent. To uncover the whole picture it is necessary to win sixteen rounds. The aim is to fill the board with as many bricks of your own color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the 8x8 grid by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The enclosed discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when there are no empty tiles left. The player with the most discs on board wins the game.</description>
