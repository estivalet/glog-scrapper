        <description>&lt;i&gt;The Wizard of Akyrz&lt;/i&gt; is the eighth game in the &lt;i&gt;Mysterious Adventures&lt;/i&gt; series. The player begins in the royal palace, where the king asks him to save his daughter from an evil wizard. If the player should succeed, his reward will be priceless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most instructions are either 90-degree compass moves, or verb-noun commands such as &amp;quot;get painting&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fit chain&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;climb tree&amp;quot;. On the player's journey he will discover treasures, which must be stored in a special room, reached via a spell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game engine has been redone to allow complete sentences, instead of the two-word &lt;a href="/search/quick?developer=Scott+Adams"&gt;Scott Adams&lt;/a&gt; parser that was used previously.</description>
