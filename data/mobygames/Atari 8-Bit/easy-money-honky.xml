        <description>This title is a compilation of two games:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Easy Money&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game. The protagonist of the game is Eddie. His task is to find the hidden treasure in the family castle. Interfering in his mission are various objects in the castle and the neighbor Beni, attempting to get the treasure for himself. In each chamber Eddi has to collect all the coins before time runs out. Between each level the player can purchase a bonus, such as the absence of Beni, skip-level, timer lock, extra lives, increasing the value of the coins, etc. In some chambers keys can be found. Reaching the key means immediate transfer to the next chamber.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Honky&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade game. The player's task is to reach the Monster who bewitched all the creatures and objects in the land. Contact with them means instant death: the player must jump over them or go under.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
