        <description>Mogul Maniac is a 1st-person perspective (although you can see your ski's) skiing game where the objective is to get through the open and and closed gates as quickly as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gates consists of 2 poles of the same color: either red or blue of which the objective is to ski between those poles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game consists of 9 different courses as well as 2 different difficulty settings (novice and expert). In the novice setting you will be penalized 5 seconds for each gate you miss, the expert setting however automatically disqualifies you if you miss a gate (although you still can complete the run).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There also is no limit to the number of players that can play, but only the fastest time will be shown on the screen.</description>
