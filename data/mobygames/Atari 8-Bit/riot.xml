        <description>&lt;i&gt;Riot&lt;/i&gt; is a side-scrolling beat'em up game set in a gypsy neighborhood. The character walks to the right and engages the enemies with no particular reason â usually two at a time. The player may punch, kick, attack with the elbow and choke on the ground. The opponents may also use a club. To recover some of the energy the player can relax by genuflection.</description>
