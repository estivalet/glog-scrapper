        <description>Includes four activities intended for young children, designed to impart and exercise basic skills with the English alphabet, numbers, drawing and music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the alphabet game the player selects letters, and is rewarded with short, amusing animations about words beginning with those letters.  The numbers game presents groups of objects, and if the player can count them correctly, more animations ensue.  The drawing section offers a blank sheet with free-form drawing tools and a selection of ready-made sprites, and the music program can compose short tunes by entering notes from an on-screen keyboard, using different instruments, each with its own sound.</description>
