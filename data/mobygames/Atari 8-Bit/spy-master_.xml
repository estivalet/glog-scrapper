        <description>&lt;i&gt;Spy Master&lt;/i&gt; is a platform game, where the player (John), equipped with a pistol, must destroy a mysterious computer located in an extensive bunker, defended by numerous divisions of Nazi soldiers. Damaging the computer requires finding and using a floppy disk containing a virus, hidden in one of the many safes. Safes may be accessed after acquiring a proper code by hacking the selected terminals. John must use designated items to access selected areas. The game contains a few hidden mini games on the terminals, accessed by using the in-game &amp;quot;Spy DOS&amp;quot; via keyboard commands.</description>
