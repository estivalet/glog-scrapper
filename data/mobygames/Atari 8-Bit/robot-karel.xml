        <description>&lt;i&gt;Robot Karel&lt;/i&gt; is an easy side-scrolling arcade game. The player controls the eponymous robot and has to find a yellow oval in the game world. When he takes one, another appears. Player then has to find it and take it. When player finds the last one, the game ends. It is not always easy to get to the oval as not every way is not evident at first glance. It should be noted that the player character can't jump so he has to find places where can climb. Player has to avoid discs that end the game if the player touches them. To avoid these discs he can crouch.</description>
