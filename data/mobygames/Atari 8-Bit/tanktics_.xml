        <description>It is September 6, 1943 following the debacle at Kursk the German Army reels back to the protection of the Dneiper River. The Red Army pursues hard trying to turn a retreat into a rout. You are in charge of a tiny Panzer Group (tank platoon) and you are the only unit capable of stopping them. You are outnumbered 2 to 1 but your orders are firm stop the Soviet tanks. You command a force up to 8 tanks or anti-tank guns in 5 different scenarios. The computer is your Soviet opponent. Tanktics is played out on a two piece full color 22&amp;quot; x 16&amp;quot; mapboard with 240 1/2&amp;quot; counters while the computer takes care of all the calculations.</description>
