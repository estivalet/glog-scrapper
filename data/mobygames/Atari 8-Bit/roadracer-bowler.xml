        <description>Sports Illustrated added its name to this pairing of auto-racing and bowling, an early graphical release for both genres. &lt;i&gt;Roadracer&lt;/i&gt; offers an overhead view of the whole track, and the two cars guided around it by two players or a player and the computer. Accelerators are automatically pushed to the floor; players control only the steering wheel and brakes. The disproportionately wide track focuses the competition on turn strategies. If you come into a corner too fast, your car will drift wide, opening an easy inside pass for your opponent. Three different tracks are offered: oval, figure-eight, and a horse shoe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Bowler&lt;/i&gt;, the perspective is also top-down, with the screen split between the score board and alley. The computer takes the back seat and just keeps score, while up to four players throw the ball. You control initial angle, and then during the roll, set the curve. The pins bounce around enough to help you pick up a split.</description>
