        <description>Obviously &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Donkey+Kong"&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/a&gt;-inspired, in Canyon Climber you try to climb to the top of the Grand Canyon, while avoiding various obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three levels, each a single screen:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Level 1 you set bombs on each side of three bridges and then push the plunger at the top to blow them up, all while jumping or outrunning charging sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Level 2 you climb ladders and run up long paths to reach the top of the screen while jumping over arrows shot by indians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Level 3 you jump pits and climb ladders to reach the top while avoiding birds that drop bricks.</description>
