        <description>TAC is a game of WWII tactical armored combat. You pick a nation (Britain, USA, Germany or Russia). Build a combat team of tanks, assault guns and tank destroyers and command the team you have created against the forces of the enemy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The computer handles the technical details which leaves the decision making to you. You search for the enemy, find them, aim your gun, knock them out and the results of the combat are determined by the computer. The game can be played solitaire or by two people.</description>
