        <description>You play as Edward &amp;quot;Pee Wee&amp;quot; Morris, who, despite his shortcomings, strives to get revenge on Porky, the owner of the bar that dissed Pee Wee and his friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;County Line&lt;br&gt;
-----------------&lt;br&gt;
You begin at the county line. You must move up from highway lane to highway lane without getting hit. You get points for dodging various obstacles on your way to Porky's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Motor Boat=1 point&lt;br&gt;The Police=100 points&lt;br&gt;Porky's Girls=200 points&lt;br&gt;Attack Pigs=400 points&lt;br&gt;Porky's Bouncers=800 points&lt;br&gt;Pig Mobile=1600 points&lt;br&gt;Last Band=3200 points&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Porky's Bar&lt;br&gt;
-----------------&lt;br&gt;
After you get all the way to the top, you enter Porky's Bar, where you have to travel the correct path up  the scaffolding, planting charges as you go. If you get to the top, there will be a detonator and so long Porky's! If you fall and Porky catches you, it is off to the swamp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Porky catches you=lose 200 points&lt;br&gt;
What points you get for exiting the scaffolding depends on the difficulty you have set the game to. The points are from 100 to 3200.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Swamp&lt;br&gt;
-----------------&lt;br&gt;
If you get caught on any other screen, you end up here. You must pole vault up and release when in mid-flight to get up to one of the platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first time you are there, you have to collect bricks then place then on the wall on the other side until you can climb out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are sent to the swamp a second time, you can climb out right away but look out for Porky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Place a brick=100 points&lt;br&gt;Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points&lt;br&gt;Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points&lt;br&gt;Falling into swamp=lose 100 points&lt;br&gt;Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shower&lt;br&gt;
-------------------&lt;br&gt;
Push the random object that appears at center, top into the pit at the bottom without getting caught by Ms. Balbricker or falling in the pit the climb out the top back to the county line. Every time you get through the shower, you stop or slow a lane on the highway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You get 100 points for pushing an object into the pit.&lt;br&gt;
You lose 200 points if you fall in the pit or are caught by Ms. Balbricker.&lt;br&gt;
Every ten seconds you are in the shower, you lose ten points so don't dawdle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difficulty settings:&lt;br&gt;
Left difficulty switch set to A=Shower scene most difficult&lt;br&gt;
Left difficulty switch set to B=Shower scene less difficult&lt;br&gt;
Right difficulty switch set to A=Swamp scene most difficult&lt;br&gt;
