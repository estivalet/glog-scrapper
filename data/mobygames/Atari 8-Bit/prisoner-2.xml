        <description>High-resolution graphics remake of the text-based adventure game inspired by the cult-classic British television show about a former spy who is abducted and sent to a resort-themed &amp;quot;prison&amp;quot; where his captors attempt to get him to reveal why he resigned from his classified job. The game takes place on &amp;quot;The Island,&amp;quot; where the player travels from building to building, each hosting a metaphorical quest in which the player's creative thinking skills are tested. Players demonstrating individual thinking eventually gain access to the Island's &amp;quot;Caretaker,&amp;quot; and their ensuing conversation (using a language parser) can lead to the player's freedom.</description>
