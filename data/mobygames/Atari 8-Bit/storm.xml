        <description>Una Cum has abducted Storm's wife Corrine and locked her in his well-guarded laboratory. Storm and his Wizard friend set off to have her in a top-down arcade game similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Gauntlet"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;. You run around rooms which are all the same size, killing monsters and collecting treasure. A simultaneous 2-player mode is on offer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The C16 version was limited from 100 rooms to 40 rooms.</description>
