        <description>&lt;i&gt;Droga do Duplandu&lt;/i&gt; is an illustrated fantasy text adventure game. According to the words of scenario author the game story is completely irrational and contains some vulgar language, therefore it is not advisable for young players. The action takes place in a land called Dupland. The player's goal is to reach the castle called PiÅºdzisko and rescue the princess Gertruda, imprisoned by the sorcerer Cootafon. The protagonist is accompanied by Cipowgryz. The journey is full of  fantasy adventures, such as meeting with the dragon or  werewolf or death and resurrection as a goat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The text in the game is supplemented by graphics. The gameplay is branching narratives - after reading a long descriptive texts the player is given two alternatives in the form of direct questions how to act in the current situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
