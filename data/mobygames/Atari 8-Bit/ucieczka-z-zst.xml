        <description>&lt;i&gt;Ucieczka z Z.S.T&lt;/i&gt; is a text adventure game. The player starts the game locked in the high school (ZespÃ³Å SzkÃ³Å Technicznych in MikoÅÃ³w, Poland) and must find a way to escape. The only escape route leads through the closed front door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The screen is divided into inventory part and descriptive text part. When the player arrives at a new location he may read a short description of the place, including possible exits, items and present individuals. The player may carry up to four items and wear clothes. The command follows a verb noun pattern or single verb orders. The game dictionary shows up after typing 'sÅÃ³wka' command.</description>
