        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Caverns of the Lost Miner&lt;/i&gt; the player controls a smiling head through a series of increasingly difficult caves, which each consist of a single screen. Each cave contains several diamonds. Once all diamonds are collected the player reaches the next cave. The gameplay is heavily influenced by &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Manic+Miner"&gt;Manic Miner&lt;/a&gt;. A life is lost if the player hits deadly objects / surfaces or falls down from high platforms.</description>
