        <description>&lt;i&gt;3-D Red Baron Dogfight/Flight Simulator&lt;/i&gt; is a simulation game where the player, flying a warplane, must shoot down an enemy fighter. The player must adjust the angle of his plane so that the enemy ends up in the crosshairs, then shoot. If the player takes too long, the enemy can shoot the player's plane down instead. The screen contains navigational indicators, as well as a counter of how many enemy planes have been shot down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an enemy is shot down, the player receives points (how many depends on how fast the enemy plane was shot down) and faces another enemy. The player loses points if his own plane is hit. The game has a time limit, and once it's up the score is tallied and the player can restart. </description>
