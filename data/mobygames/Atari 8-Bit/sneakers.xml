        <description>&lt;i&gt;Sneakers&lt;/i&gt; is a variation on Atari's classic &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders"&gt; Space Invaders&lt;/a&gt;. Move your ship to the left and to the right and shoot enemies who try to fall down and kill you. There are eight types of enemies, each one using a different tactic to destroy you. You start with the relatively harmless Sneakers and gradually work your way through Cyclops, Saucers, Fangs, H-Wings, Meteors, Scrambles, and Scrubs. After you finish off the Scrubs, you proceed to level 2, which follows the same pattern, but with an increased difficulty level.</description>
