        <description>&lt;i&gt;Time Bandit&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Snake"&gt;Snake&lt;/a&gt; variant where the player controls a worm called Herbie. The goal of the game is to eat all power pills in each level. When all pills have been eaten an exit opens up and the player can progress to the next level. For each pill that Herbie eats his body grows longer. In addition to the pills there are obstacles that the player has to avoid colliding with since that will cost a life. The same will happen if Herbie collides with his own long tail. After each level there is a bonus level where Herbie is joined by a second worm which is called Hank. Hank is out to catch Herbie and if he manages to do so the player will not get any bonus points. The game consists of 300 levels and an edit mode that allows the player to create an additional 100 levels.</description>
