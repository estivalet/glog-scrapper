        <description>&lt;i&gt;Bombaman&lt;/i&gt; is an ambitious &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/game/turbo-grafx/bomberman"&gt;Bomberman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; clone for the MSX computer with both a story mode and a tournament multiplayer mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the story mode, which takes place on the &amp;quot;Iko Iko Island&amp;quot;, you start out in a village of Bombermen as an orphan. On the graveyard, near your mother's grave, you hear a mysterious voice urging you to enter the flooded Greek temple. Naturally, these turn out to be typical &lt;i&gt;Bomberman&lt;/i&gt; arenas, filled with destructible square terrain, wandering monsters of different kinds, and power-ups as well as power-downs. In order to progress in your quest, you must bomb your way through these arenas, picking up items that will open the door to the next level. There are several worlds to progress through in this adventure mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the multiplayer mode, up to four players can play at once, on joysticks and keyboard, in a tournament where the last one standing wins the match, and the tournament is won by the one with most victories. If the match goes on for too long, the walls of the arena start to close in, forcing the contestants closer together or swallowing them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game features many bells and whistles, such as a jukebox in the disco in the village, a map editor and support for modern hardware such as the Moonsound sound module, hard disk support and sampled sound effects.</description>
