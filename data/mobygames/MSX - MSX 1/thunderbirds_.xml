        <description>International Rescue is made up of Jeff Tracy, Brains, and Tracy's five sons, each of whom has a Thunderbird craft of their own. They have four missions to complete in turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.</description>
