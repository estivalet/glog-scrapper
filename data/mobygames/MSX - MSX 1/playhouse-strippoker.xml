        <description>European answer to American &lt;a href="/game/strip-poker-a-sizzling-game-of-chance"&gt;Artworx Strip Poker&lt;/a&gt;, this game introduces one girl in MSX1 original version and two girls with different names and slightly different looks in other versions (Amiga, Atari ST, DOS versus MSX2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The playmate welcomes you in her apartment and proposes a card game. The game is a poker, and when player loses another $100, some part of her dress will be removed. The goal is to keep your clothes on and to make a girl completely naked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The graphics in original MSX1 game is different, but other versions tries to keep conceptual design of original.</description>
