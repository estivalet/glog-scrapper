        <description>The puzzle and platform game &lt;i&gt;Castle Excellent&lt;/i&gt; is a sequel to &lt;a id="d74bd76a1e4f32ffddd3d17d715cd5617" href="/search/quick?game=The+Castle"&gt;The Castle&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;Castle Excellent&lt;/i&gt; you control a prince that has to save the princess again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find your princess you have to explore the castle, which has 100 different rooms. Each room is a puzzle on its own as you have to avoid enemy knights, fat Tiroler men, hazardous objects and have to use objects to get to the next door.
In each room you have to collect keys and items like rings and gold bars. The keys may have different colors and only opens doors with the corresponding key color.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main difference with the original &lt;i&gt;The Castle&lt;/i&gt; game is that the castle rooms are completely redesigned and contain many new challenges. The game play has not changed.</description>
