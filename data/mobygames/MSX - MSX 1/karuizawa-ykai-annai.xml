        <description>A girl named Kumiko is spending a vacation with her younger sister Nagisa in Karuizawa, a popular tourist destination in Japan. The vacation turns into nightmare when Nagisa doesn't return home from the local supermarket. Kumiko receives a strange phone call later that evening, and decides to call the police. However, the authorities seem unable to solve the mystery, and Kumiko's boyfriend decides to conduct the investigation by himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Karuizawa YÅ«kai Annai&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure game that relies on exploration and information-gathering rather than on puzzle-solving. Individual locations are displayed as still screens viewed from first-person perspective; however, the player can also navigate the protagonist on a top-down map. The player is presented with a large menu of commands, which are for the most part identical on every screen. Some of these commands can be combined with objects chosen from a menu.</description>
