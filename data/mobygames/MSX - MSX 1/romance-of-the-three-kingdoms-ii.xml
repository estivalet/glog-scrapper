        <description>The sequel to &lt;a href="/game/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms"&gt;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing' from &lt;i&gt;RTK I&lt;/i&gt; (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). &lt;i&gt;RTK&lt;/i&gt; can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The &lt;i&gt;RTK II&lt;/i&gt; gameplay and interface is closely similar to &lt;a href="/game/nobunagas-ambition-ii"&gt;Nobunaga's Ambition II&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
