        <description>&lt;i&gt;Cyborg Z&lt;/i&gt; is a sci-fi vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. One or two players control identically-looking giant robots reminiscent of &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Mazinger+Z"&gt;Mazinger Z&lt;/a&gt;, moving in all directions and shooting at enemies as the screen slowly scrolls forward. The game's visual design and gameplay are very similar to those of Zemina's own &lt;a href="/game/three-dragon-story"&gt;The Three Dragon Story&lt;/a&gt;. Weapon power-ups are stored in boxes that must be destroyed to acquire them. The robot starts with a close-range punch attack; additional weapons include laser gun, energy bullets, rockets, and others. Players can switch between the weapons at any time. There are eight levels in total in the game, each culminating with a boss battle.</description>
