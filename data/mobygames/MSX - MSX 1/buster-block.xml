        <description>&lt;i&gt;Buster Block&lt;/i&gt; is a maze game where the player needs to go through 25 levels and destroy monsters by pushing blocks onto them. Energy is lost when the player collides with a monster or gets pushed by a block. The game is based on the two BBC Micro titles &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Pingu"&gt;Pingu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/game/rubble-trouble"&gt;Rubble Trouble&lt;/a&gt; and uses 16 types of blocks; those from the games it is based on along with blocks that can go around corners. There are six different monsters and the game's 400 rooms are not random, but designed individually. Energy can also be gained back, along with bonus points.</description>
