        <description>This is a shoot-em-up game is the sequel to &lt;a href="/game/exerion"&gt;Exerion&lt;/a&gt; again with parallax effects in the background. It does have a simulation of inertia in the control of the ship.
There are dozens of enemies and two types of shooting: slow and fast.
Two weapon systems: one slow double-shot cannon and one fast single-shot cannon.
With each enemy hit by the slow cannon you get one shot added to the fast cannon ammunition supply.
A challenge stage follows each stage in which you can build up your fast-shot bullet supply.</description>
