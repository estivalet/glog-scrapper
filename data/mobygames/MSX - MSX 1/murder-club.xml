        <description>&lt;i&gt;Murder Club&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure game with simulation elements. The player controls the private detective J.B. Harold, who must investigate the murder of a wealthy businessman named Bill Robbins and bring the murderer to court. The player has to do all the work a real detective would do: find clues, gather evidence, interrogate suspects, establish the motive for the crime â and in the end, make sure the case will stand up in the court. </description>
