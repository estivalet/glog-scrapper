        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Banana&lt;/i&gt;, you are a round little thing on the Amazonas river, hunted by the man-eating Boconda tribe. A bit like &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Q%2aBert"&gt;Q*Bert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, you jump around on stones in the river. Jumping is done by placing a cursor, with limited range, above a stone. If you don't place it right above the stone, you instead jump into the water. This isn't necessarily lethal, since you can jump up on adjacent stones, or you can go with the flow, as long as you take care not to pulled by the strong current into a spot where there are no stones to seek refuge on. It is also in the water that you will catch bananas coming down the stream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bananas are necessary to get rid of the Bocondas; they can be placed on top of stones, and if a Boconda tries to jump at you, they will land on a banana and slip into the river where they are swept away. They are smart, though, so you will need to trick them into jumping onto your boobytrapped stones. Instead of tricking them, you can also swim to the river shore, pick up stones on the shore and throw them at the Bocondas to make them fall off their stones.</description>
