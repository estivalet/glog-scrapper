        <description>Several months have passed since the protagonist of this game experienced the sexual pleasures and horrors of the mysterious mansion. One day he goes on a date with a girl named Reiko, and his girlfriend YÅko gets jealous. Returning home, the young man begins to think of his behavior and how to improve it, and gradually sinks into a dream that takes him back to the mansion and back to sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third installment of the Twilight Zone series is very similar to its &lt;a href="/game/twilight-zone-ii-nagisa-no-yakata"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt; visually and gameplay-wise. Like the previous game, it is a pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawler with turn-based battles against naked girls, where RPG activities are replaced by sexual positions and alike. New in this iteration is an automap feature and a point-and-click interface for the basic battle command, allowing the player to choose a girl's body part to touch.</description>
