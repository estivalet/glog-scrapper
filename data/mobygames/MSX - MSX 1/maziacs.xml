        <description>&lt;i&gt;Maziacs&lt;/i&gt; is a maze game. The maze in Maziacs has no edges but has around 100 locations and a new maze is generated at each game start. The aim of &lt;i&gt;Maziacs&lt;/i&gt; is to find the treasure and take it to the point the game started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All scattered over the maze are prisoners, food, swords and treasures for you to collect but you are chased by monsters that will attack you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sword can only kill one Maziac, a hostile and horrible monster and it's only possible to carry one item at the time. Without a sword, you can still fight Maziacs, but your chances of victory are much lower. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You need to collect food or you will die of starvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find the treasure you should ask the prisoners who can show you the way, but only for a short distance. The route will turn yellow for a short time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prisoners will also tell you the way back to your starting point.
As you can only carry one item at the time it is best to kill as many Maziacs on your way to the treasure.</description>
