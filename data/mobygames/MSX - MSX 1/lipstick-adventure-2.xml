        <description>This is the second entry in &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Lipstick+Adventure"&gt; Lipstick Adventure&lt;/a&gt; series. Once again, the protagonist is the young private detective Gorou. One day his girlfriend Otomi introduces to him a customer, a man who calls himself Sakamoto. When Gorou meets him at the train station, Sakamoto hands him a suitcase, saying he should deliver it to his company in Osaka. However, the suitcase contains a bomb, and the poor Gorou is brought to police headquarters as a terrorist suspect...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the first game, &lt;i&gt;Lipstick Adventure 2&lt;/i&gt; is a detective/mystery Japanese-style adventure with comical and erotic elements. The player typically advances in the game by going through all the menu commands at a given screen. The commands are of a traditional &amp;quot;Look - Talk - Think - Move&amp;quot; variety, with sub-menus for object names.</description>
