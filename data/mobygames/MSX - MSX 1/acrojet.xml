        <description>&lt;i&gt;Acrojet&lt;/i&gt; contains ten acrobatic events which can be played by up to four players and at four different levels of difficulty.
In all ten events you fly a BD5J Acrojet over a series of obstacles:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Pylon Race you have to fly around pylons and land safely. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Slalom Race you have to fly a 'figure 8'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the next event, the Ribbon Cut you have to break two ribbons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Inverted Ribbon Cut you perform the same stunt but flying the plane upside down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Ribbon Roll there are two ribbons in a row and you have to fly under one&lt;/li&gt;
and complete a full roll followed by flying under the second ribbon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Under Ribbon Race you perform a slalom by flying in sequence under three ribbons. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Under Ribbon Loop you fly under a ribbon followed by a loop and passing over the same ribbon upside down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Spot Landing event you have to fly up to 2,000 feet and land on the runway as close as possible to a marked spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Flame-Out Landing event you perform the same stunt 
but then without the engines running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tenth and last event, the Cuban Eight, you have to make a half-loop over a ribbon, followed by a half-role, a half loop and flying under the first ribbon again. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Some game parameters can be set. You can decide how the weather conditions are going to be.
An instrument panel at the bottom of the screen contains several read-outs, like a altitude meter, a compass, an artificial horizon and a vertical velocity meter.</description>
