        <description>Two horrifying incidents that happened in two unrelated places. A man in Peru, one of the constructors of a new dam. An American female exchange student in Japan. Both were suddenly struck by a horrible disease that deformed their faces... Two young special agents, Alice and Brian, are sent to investigate the mystery, that will lead them into a dark world of occult and demonic forces...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Akuma no Fukuin&lt;/i&gt; (Japanese for &lt;i&gt;Devil's Gospel&lt;/i&gt;) is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player chooses menu commands (&amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, etc.) that are displayed under a still picture that represents the location. Most of these command have their own context-dependent sub-menus, i.e. it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to look at different things and talk about different topics. There are no puzzles, and the story usually advances when the player has triggered a necessary conversation or event.</description>
