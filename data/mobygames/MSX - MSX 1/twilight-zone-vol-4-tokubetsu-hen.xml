        <description>Aliens have invaded Earth. Seemingly impervious to damage, they took control of the planet. Only a few partisan organizations dared to oppose their rule. All the aliens look like young and attractive human women, and soon it was found out that they have a weakness to sperm. Thus, a young Japanese man and his few male allies embark on a quest to defeat the aliens by having sex with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fourth installment of the Twilight Zone series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. Like the three previous games, it is an RPG where the enemies are exclusively semi-naked girls and most battle commands correspond to sexual actions. Unlike the preceding games, navigation is done in top-down view, though the battles remain first-person. Up to three characters will join the protagonist and take part in combat. There is no world map and the game is built in a fairly linear way, with only a few friendly areas where enemies do not appear.</description>
