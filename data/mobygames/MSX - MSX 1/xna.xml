        <description>Tetsu is a young warrior who has left his home country in order to serve human rulers in their battle against the dark elves. But one day the valiant knight was heavily wounded in battle. Unconscious, he was found by a female fighter named Mei, who brought him to her house and cured him.

In town, it is possible to buy weapons and rest. The player controls only Tetsu and Mei during the entire game, as they fight random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining levels.
