        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Lipstick Adventure&lt;/i&gt;, the player takes the role of Gorou, a young Japanese private detective. One day, a wealthy and powerful old man contacts him and asks him to find a box which - according to him - contained a family treasure. The young detective thinks that fortune has finally smiled to him, but when his pretty girlfriend Otomi disappears, he realizes that the mystery is bigger than he thought...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, with the usual first-person view and &amp;quot;Look - Talk - Think - Move&amp;quot; interface. There are no puzzles, and the game usually advances the plot when all the commands at a given screen are depleted, sometimes requiring to visit different locations several times.</description>
