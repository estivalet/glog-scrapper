        <description>Building on the basic gameplay and visual ideas of &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Ultimate"&gt;Ultimate's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/game/zx-spectrum/atic-atac"&gt;Atic Atac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Wizard's Lair&lt;/i&gt; stars an explorer named Pothole Pete, who is stuck in the Lair unless he can find all four pieces of the Golden Lion. The game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than the fuller jungle graphics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pace of the game is quite fast, and the challenge of the action elements is increased by not having infinite weaponry. The route through the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and secret rooms commonplace. Although the screens always contain a particular area, rather than the sections of different areas viewed in &lt;i&gt;Atic Atac&lt;/i&gt; (meaning that the player would often have to work out how to reach some sections via other screens), a river is a central aspect of the layout, delimiting some sections of the screens.</description>
