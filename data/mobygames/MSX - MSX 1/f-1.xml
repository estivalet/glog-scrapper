        <description>&amp;quot;F-1&amp;quot; is an unofficial Formula 1 racing game. You must compete along the Formula 1 season (16 circuits included). There are three game modes: Practise, Race (Single race) &amp;amp; Complete season. 
 
Before each race, you can modify aspects like tires, transmission (manual or automatic), the number of laps or the difficulty level (between three levels).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the race, if you have problems, you have the option to stop at the boxes to repair your car.</description>
