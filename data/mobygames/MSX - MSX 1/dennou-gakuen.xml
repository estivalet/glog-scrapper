        <description>You have been selected as one of the few lucky male pupils to go to the famous Cybernetic Hi-School. But before you can enroll, you must undergo three tests executed by fellow female pupils. Each test has three rounds of 25 questions, of which 20 must be correctly answered. As you finish a round, your examinator takes off some clothes, until they are entirely naked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The questions are decidedly nerdy, pertaining mainly to science fiction, comics, animation and toys, as well as the technology used in such genres and media.</description>
