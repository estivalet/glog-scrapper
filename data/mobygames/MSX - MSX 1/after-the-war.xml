        <description>Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as &amp;quot;Jungle Rogers&amp;quot;, the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later you await the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</description>
