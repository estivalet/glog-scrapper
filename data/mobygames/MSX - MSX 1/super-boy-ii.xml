        <description>&lt;i&gt;Super Boy II&lt;/i&gt; has less to do with any version of &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Super+Mario+Bros%2e+2"&gt;Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/a&gt; than it does with its &lt;a href="/game/super-boy-i"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, which is, in turn, based on the &lt;a href="/game/super-mario-bros"&gt;first Super Mario&lt;/a&gt; game. The game is identical to the first installment of the Korean-made unlicensed Mario conversions in terms of gameplay and visuals; level design is also very similar, with only slight variations and no new terrain, enemies, traps, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of the features omitted in the previous entry returns in this iteration; once again, there are no secrets, underwater stages, warp zones, bonuses, or other power-ups besides the mushroom. The only difference is in the actual layout of the locations, as well as in the message following a Bowser encounter in a castle; instead of being greeted by &amp;quot;Sorry Nothing&amp;quot;, the player is encouraged by the order &amp;quot;Go! Next stage&amp;quot;.</description>
