        <description>The third chapter in the Pinky Ponky series is identical to its predecessors visually and gameplay-wise. Like in the previous two games, the protagonist, a young man named Akira, must successfully seduce five young women in five different scenarios. The goal is to select dialogue choices and actions that would raise the girl's satisfaction meter and trigger the next scene. Failure to do so will break off the current scenario and end the game after the fifth one. The situations are fairly traditional compared to the second game, involving encounters on a train, in an amusement park, in an apartment complex, etc.</description>
