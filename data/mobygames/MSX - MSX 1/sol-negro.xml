        <description>A millenarian spell, transmitted from parents to children, turned the muscular Bully into a fish and the indomitable MÃ³nica into a hawk. Every full moon one of them suffers a transformation and the other recovers his normal form, which prevents them to be together. Only an extraordinary phenomenon can break the spell, something as extraordinary as a sun eclipse... the Black Sun. In order to break the spell, Bully must free MÃ³nica (the hawk) of her cage for, turned he in fish, arrive on time together at the sacred submarine temple of the sun, a grotto located beyond the borders of the city submerged of Hidrionis, just at the moment in which the moon is embraced with the sun and a huge shade crosses the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The objective in the first stage is to rescue MÃ³nica, turned a hawk, for which you will have to locate the key of the cage on which she is imprisoned and go to rescue her, you will count with the help of a jet pack and a M-92 rifle laser; once done, face together with her all the dangers until arriving at the magical palace. The second stage is developed at the heart of the ocean. MÃ³nica must protect Bully in his form of fish and together with him arrive at the submarine grotto. MÃ³nica counts with an aquatic propellent and a hydro leak pistol with which she will have to defended herself against the submarine enemies.</description>
