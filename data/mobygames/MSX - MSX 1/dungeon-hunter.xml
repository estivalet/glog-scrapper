        <description>Dungeon Hunter is a First Person Shooter dungeon horror game that is played using a gun joystick. There were three different levels, or settings, that you play in. You travel your way through forests, dungeons, and caverns, and some graveyards at the end of a level. Each setting offered a slightly different variety of enemies. Enemies encountered are of the standard type found in most early games of the genre, such as bats and skeletons.  To help navigate through the maze-like levels, a map is available for access. The entire game is played using the gun joystick so that movement is also done by shooting on the arrows onscreen.</description>
