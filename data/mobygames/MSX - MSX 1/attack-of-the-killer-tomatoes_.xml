        <description>You are a factory worker and start your shift at the PuraTom processing plant and you find that all tomatoes have mutated. You have to stop the mutated killer tomatoes by put them into holes. The smaller bouncing tomatoes must be crushed. This must all be done before your shift is over! This means wandering to various rooms to locate the tomatoes and to find various objects you can use to kill them.
There are some punch cards around, those cards will buy you some extra time. The cards must be inserted in the cube objects in the factory plant.</description>
