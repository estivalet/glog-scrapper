        <description>You control a crossbowman that protects his king from being taken by enemy hot-air balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried far up into the sky by one of the balloons by firing arrows at squads of descending hot air balloons. If the king is actually picked up he will scream &amp;quot;Help&amp;quot;, and if he disappears he will say &amp;quot;Bye, bye&amp;quot;. Each round is completed when all 42 balloons have been destroyed.</description>
