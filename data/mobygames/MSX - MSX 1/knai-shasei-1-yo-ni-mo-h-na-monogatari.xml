        <description>&lt;i&gt;KÅnai Shasei&lt;/i&gt; opens with a text introduction that describes a miraculous Girls' High School that can be accessed by sailing through the Indian Ocean or walking along the Silk Road - a school that even the famous Marco Polo allegedly describes in his memoirs. This establishes the humorous tone of subsequent narrative, which has little to do with history and a lot to do with pretty high school girls. The game has no real story, being instead composed of five unrelated vignettes, short episodes that feature a sexy high school girl, a male protagonist (named &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; by default), and various comical and erotic situations under different circumstances: meeting in a school, haunted house, crowded train station, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay walks the middle ground between a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; Japanese-style adventure and a visual novel. There are verb commands and sometimes also vast sub-menus with objects that allow text-based interaction; however, many segments are very straightforward and only involve occasional choice-making. There are also a few mini-games, such as a quiz, which must be solved by the player in order to avoid a premature Game Over.</description>
