        <description>The evil Minister Pumpkin betrayed his king, kidnapped his daughter, the lovely Princess Tomato, and began to terrorize the land of vegetables. The king entrusted Sir Cucumber with the task of freeing his daughter and his kingdom. Without further delay, the brave warrior embarks on a long journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Salad no Kuni no Tomato-hime&lt;/i&gt; is a text adventure game with graphics. Locations are presented as still images viewed from first-person perspective, and the player interacts with the environment by typing commands. Even though the game's text is entirely in Japanese, the game only understands commands in English, mainly simple combinations of verbs and objects.</description>
