        <description>&lt;i&gt;D.C. Connection&lt;/i&gt;, the third entry in the &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=J%2eB%2e+Harold+Series"&gt; J.B. Harold Series&lt;/a&gt;, is - perhaps not very surprisingly - set in Washington, D.C., the capital of United States of America. Walter Edwards, the chief of Liberty Town police, was found murdered near the grave of President Kennedy. His son Frederick is the prime suspect. However, when it becomes known that a very important FBI document has disappeared, the private investigator J.B. Harold decides that he must investigate the case on his own, without trusting the authorities...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game plays similarly to the &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=manhattan+requiem"&gt; previous entry&lt;/a&gt;: J.B. Harold visit various locations in Washington, talking to people, questioning suspects, searching apartments, and generally gathering clues. The progress of the investigation can be reviewed in the hotel where the J.B. Harold is staying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite its Japanese origins, the game has realistic graphics without any manga/anime influences.</description>
