        <description>The year is 2042, the stage is a huge futuristic city Neo Kobe. Among the remains of passengers who died in a plane crash, experts discovered a strange biomechanical organism. Recent events proved that it was not the only appearance of a &amp;quot;snatcher&amp;quot; -a robotic creature who can masterfully disguise itself as a human being in order to infiltrate and to destroy human society. Gillian Seed, a man who suffers from amnesia, remembers just this word: &amp;quot;snatcher&amp;quot;. He joins the Junkers, a combat unit whose goal is to track down and to exterminate the snatchers, and is determined to find out the truth about those creatures and his past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;SD Snatcher&lt;/i&gt; is based on the same story as the more famous &lt;a href="/game/snatcher"&gt; Snatcher&lt;/a&gt;, but gameplay-wise it is an entirely different game: an RPG. You navigate your hero from top-down view, enter buildings and talk to people. In many locations you'll meet enemies who are visible on the screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a turn-based battle begins. You can choose to fire from a variety of weapons, and to target a specific part of the enemy's body. Targeting has a direct effect in battles: for example, shooting the enemy's gun will weaken it, destroying its wheels will prevent it from avoiding your shots to its face or body, etc. You gain experience points (&amp;quot;rank points&amp;quot;), improving in different categories (speed, defense, etc.). You also improve your weapon skills by continuously using the same weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike &lt;i&gt;Snatcher&lt;/i&gt; with its &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; graphics, the characters in &lt;i&gt;SD Snatcher&lt;/i&gt; have a typically Japanese anime &amp;quot;super-deformed&amp;quot; style, which adds an element of a parody to the game.</description>
