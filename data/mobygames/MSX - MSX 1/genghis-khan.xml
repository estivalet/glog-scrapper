        <description>&lt;i&gt;Genghis Khan&lt;/i&gt; is a top-down 2D turn-based grand strategy game, based on the real mongol leader Genghis Khan's life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game's main objective is to become the supreme ruler. The player can select from two campaigns: Mongol conquest or World conquest. In the Mongol conquest, players take on the role as Temujin (later known as Genghis Khan), with the goal being to unite all the tribes of Mongolia. In the World conquest, Players can be one of four characters. Similar to the Mongol conquest, players must unite all the countries together. Players can use military force (players must gather an army and lead them into war) or use diplomacy (including things such as strategic marriages). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main focus of the game involves management of territory, as the player manages various activities that improve their provinces. Battlefields are hex tiled based, with players giving commands to units groups with the objective of  trying to defeat the forces of the enemy combatants.</description>
