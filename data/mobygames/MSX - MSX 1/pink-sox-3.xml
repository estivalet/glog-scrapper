        <description>&lt;i&gt;Pink Sox 3&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi Japanese-style adventure &lt;i&gt;Who Is There?&lt;/i&gt;, focusing primarily on lesbian relationships of the characters. The quiz game returns in a simplified form, with the tile-matching puzzle portions completely removed; the player simply has to answer several global knowledge questions correctly to unravel an erotic picture. New to this volume is a card game played with a special deck, in which players try to assemble pairs and other combinations in order to beat the partner.</description>
