        <description>You maneuver a snake across the screen eating boxed objects that make it's tail grow. At the the same time you have to avoid obstacles like it's own tail, monsters and the screen edge. The screen edge will open occasionally and that gives you the opportunity to enter the screen on the opposing side.Question marks may appear on the screen and can be eaten for bonuses. You 'll enter the next round when all objects are cleared.</description>
