        <description>In the final instalment of the &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Time+Magik"&gt;Time and Magik series&lt;/a&gt; of interactive fiction, the light from the &lt;a href="/game/red-moon"&gt;Red Moon&lt;/a&gt; is under threat. It was captured and harnessed by the magicians of Baskalos, but its keeper Myglar has turned against them and is using it for himself. He must be defeated before the crystal is exhausted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The typing interface is typical of Level 9 games of the era. Time saving features include an ALL command can apply TAKE and EXAMINE to every object you can see, and the ability to type future commands while the screen is still scrolling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;18 spells are available, activated using 3-letter codes you will discover while exploring. These range from confusing or angering an enemy to healing yourself and detecting danger.</description>
