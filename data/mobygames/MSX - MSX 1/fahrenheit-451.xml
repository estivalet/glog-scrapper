        <description>Based on &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,116815/"&gt;Ray Bradbury&lt;/a&gt;'s classic science fiction novel &lt;i&gt;Fahrenheit 451&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a not so distant future, books have become illegal. As Fireman Guy Montag, the player's role is not to save houses, but to burn them for the books inside. However, Guy becomes passionate about books and becomes a rebel, pursued by the authorities. With the help of the Underground, he must survive and save books from complete extinction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game acts a sequel to Bradbury's novel.  Following the imposition of martial law Montag finds the young woman who inspired his resistance to the established order.  With her help he can now track down 34 microcassettes which hold the contents of the New York Public Library, then pass them on to underground members who will memorise the texts.
