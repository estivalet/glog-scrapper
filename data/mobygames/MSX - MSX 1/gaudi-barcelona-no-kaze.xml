        <description>&lt;i&gt;Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze&lt;/i&gt; was the first adventure developed by &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=wolf+team"&gt; Wolf Team&lt;/a&gt;. It takes place in the Spanish city of Barcelona, which just the year before the release of the game was chosen for the celebration of the 25th Olympic Games. This is important to mention as the game takes place in the summer of 1992, the time at which the Olympic Games were being held in Barcelona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is a classic graphical adventure with static images and text, with the occasional appearance of small menus that ask you which action you want to execute next. Hard-boiled stories will be touching each corner of the most emblematic spaces of the city (which had been digitalized for the occasion, with special mention to the monuments designed by Spanish architect Antoni GaudÃ­). The stories have all the elements of a thriller, including terrorist attacks, characters with a dark past, romance, crime, etc. all this accompanied by elegant Latin jazz throughout the adventure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
