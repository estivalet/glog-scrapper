        <description>&lt;i&gt;Hacchake Ayayo-san&lt;/i&gt; is a very short visual novel starring Ayayo, a seventeen-year-old girl who finds a part-time job as a clerk in Mr. Suzuki's shop. Further plot is dedicated to her sexual encounters with customers and the owner. The gameplay is very limited and consists of occasional choices the player must make to slightly affect the course of the plot. Some of the sex scenes have animated segments.</description>
