        <description>&lt;i&gt;Hang-On&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade racing game, also bundled with the Master System and reminiscent of &lt;a href="/search/quick?quickSearch=000121642264"&gt;Pole Position&lt;/a&gt;, but with bikes. The player races against time, battling an unlimited amount of opponents on a highway. While the clock ticks down, he should try to maneuver past his opponents and to steer clear of obstacles on the side of the road. Beating the clock extends the time and draws a new backdrop to race in.</description>
