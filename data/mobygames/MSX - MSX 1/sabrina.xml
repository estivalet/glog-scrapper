        <description>The game features the eventful journey that a popular singer -Sabrina Salerno.- must suffer to be able to be transferred from the airport to the nearest television studios. In order to arrive there, she must cross a town whose inhabitants seem to be a little dis-conformed with her way to be, act, and mainly, to dress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your mission will be to guide Sabrina in an arduous way, avoiding or eliminating as many enemies as possible. They are of several kinds, although all of them have an aspect in common: they are normal people of whom can be found in the street in the dozens. Thus, for example, the typical housewives, the knifer, the aggressive punker, the exorcist priest, the old woman with her cane and others of citizen tropisms.</description>
