Master the qualification games to reach the final tournament and try to get the World Cup. You can fill up your team with 22 players, and can give each of them individual tactical game instructions. Before each game you give an interview that has influence of the morals of your players. In every half-time you can give new instructions to your team and make tactical corrections.</description>
