        <description>After the huge success of the first two releases HAL Laboratory released a third golf simulation game. Again it is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective.
Hole In One Special can be played  up to two players at three difficulty levels: average, expert and pro.
You can compete in stroke play, match play and tournament play. The tournament play can be set at one to four days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the game the following options can be changed: the direction of the ball, pick a club, set the curve of the ball and the stroke power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main difference with the other two releases in the Hole In One series for MSX is that Hole In One Special makes full use of the MSX2 graphical capabilities and can only be played on MSX2 computers.</description>
