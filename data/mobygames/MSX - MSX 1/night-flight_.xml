        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Night Flight&lt;/i&gt;, you fly an airplane above a city, leaving a trace of dots behind. If the trace forms a rectangle, it is filled in. What makes this difficult is the fact that you are chased by a bolt of lightning (let out by the thunder god, no less). From time to time, a shooting star also crosses the screen. If you manage to trap the bolt of lightning within your line, the level is cleared. Much like in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/game/arcade/qix"&gt;Qix&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; though, if the lightning or the star hits your line while it is being drawn, you lose a plane. However, lives are not lost just because a plane is hit. In an intermission, a plane flown by a comrade crosses the screen while you fall in a parachute, and with some luck or skill, you may guide the plane to pick up the falling pilot so that you are given a new chance.</description>
