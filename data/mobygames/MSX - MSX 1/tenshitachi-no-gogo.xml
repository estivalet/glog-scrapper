        <description>One of the first adult games with a recognizable anime style, &lt;i&gt;Tenshitachi no Gogo&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure game set in a Japanese high school. The goal of the game is to seduce Yumiko Shiraishi, the star girl of the tennis club. To seduce her, the protagonist will have to become acquainted and intimate with her friends by talking to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player interacts with the environment by either typing text commands or selecting pre-set ones from a list. Though there are a few instances of interaction with objects, most of the game revolves around moving between locations and talking to characters. There is no puzzle solving in the game.</description>
