One day he has a strange dream after having dozed off in his office: he has found an enormous mythical treasure, which is guarded by a terrifying monster... when he wakes up, strange things begin to happen one after the other. Ryuusuke finds a mysterious ancient staff and decides to investigate its secret; beautiful golden-haired girl tells him he is on a a grand mission... Which is dream and which is reality? That is what the hero will have to find out...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;DEã»JA&lt;/i&gt; is a Japanese-style adventure. At every screen, a menu with verb commands appears at the bottom. The commands include Examine, Talk, Ask, Take, Use (an inventory item), Move, as well as other context-specific commands that appear on some screens. Choosing a verb usually leads to an object sub-menu. Typically, the game's story advances once the player has gone through most of the commands and acquired the needed information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game has some scenes with nudity and mildly depicted sexual situations.</description>
