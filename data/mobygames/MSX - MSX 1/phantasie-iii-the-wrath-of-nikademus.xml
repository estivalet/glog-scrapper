        <description>&lt;i&gt;Phantasie III: The Wrath of Nikademus&lt;/i&gt; is the third chapter of the &lt;i&gt;Phantasie&lt;/i&gt; trilogy. This time, the Dark Lord Nikademus has set his evil sights on conquering - not only an island - but the entire world. He must be stopped, and you've chosen to undertake this difficult and dangerous quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basic gameplay in this game is quite similar to the system implemented in &lt;a href="/game/phantasie"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/game/phantasie-ii"&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, with several additions and enhancements. Some weapons and spells have been added. During combat, you can move each character to the front, middle, or back of the party. It's also possible to aim your spells at different ranks of the enemy. Wounds are specified by body location and extent of injury.</description>
