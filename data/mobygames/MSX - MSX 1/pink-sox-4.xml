        <description>&lt;i&gt;Pink Sox 4&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi Japanese-style adventure &lt;i&gt;Who Is There?&lt;/i&gt;, as well as a continuation of &lt;i&gt;Halftime Lover&lt;/i&gt;, this time non-interactive. The simplified quiz game from the &lt;a href="/game/pink-sox-3"&gt;previous game&lt;/a&gt; returns as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This volume introduces four new mini-games. The first is a simple mini-adventure depicting a sexual relationship between a student and her teachers, male and female. The second is a &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Whac-A-Mole"&gt;Whac-A-Mole&lt;/a&gt; variant with various creatures popping out of the holes. The third mini-game involves rapidly pressing a key to align falling objects of different weight. Finally, the fourth game features descending heads (monkey, human, and a reptile monster) that have to be attached to the bodies below by quickly moving them around and turning them left and right.  The last two games award the player with erotic images, varying depending on the score achieved by the player.</description>
