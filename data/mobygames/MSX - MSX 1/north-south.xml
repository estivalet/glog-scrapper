        <description>Based on the Belgian comic book, &amp;quot;Les Tuniques Bleues&amp;quot;, this strategy game allows you to replay the American Civil War from both the North and the South sides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the strategy part of the game, you can move your troops on a map of the US. If two opposing armies enter the same state, the battle is played out in an action sequence. Additional action sequences must be accomplished when capturing an enemy fort or train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game also offers a two-player-mode.</description>
