        <description>Based on &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,2889/"&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/a&gt;'s classic science fiction novel &lt;i&gt;Rendezvous With Rama&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an uncatalogued giant asteroid is discovered approaching Earth, scientists soon realize that it is in reality an alien starship. As commander of the spaceship Endeavor, and being the nearest to the gargantuan ship, it is up to you to rendezvous with it and explore it before it leaves the Solar system.</description>
