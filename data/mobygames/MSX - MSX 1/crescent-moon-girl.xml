        <description>The protagonist of &lt;i&gt;Crescent Moon Girl&lt;/i&gt; is a cat who accidentally walks into a tent and triggers the appearance of a mysterious female magician and her strange assistant. They turn the cat into a young man and tell him that in order to become a cat again he has to find three particularly well-endowed young girls and bring them to the tent. The ex-feline begins his quest in a town containing many female inhabitants, with only a select few answering to the requirements that are his ticket back to his native shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay follows a Japanese template, with menu-based navigation and interaction with the environment. Each location offers various verb commands (Look, Talk, Enter, Touch, etc.), most of which can (and should) be combined with objects or persons in a sub-menu. Conversation topics can be selected as well; in particular, it is possible to ask most female characters about their age, hobbies, three sizes, etc. The game has scenes with explicit nudity.</description>
