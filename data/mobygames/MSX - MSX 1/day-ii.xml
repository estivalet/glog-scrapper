        <description>The android terrorist organization Metalabor stole the highly valuable Mega Plutonium K element, intending to use it for military purposes. Their biggest mistake, however, was kidnapping the sister of the pilot Captain Lee in order to force their father, a famous scientist, to aid them in their nefarious plans. Captain Lee decides to rescue his sister alone, and perhaps find a way to stop Metalabor altogether.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Day II&lt;/i&gt; is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up and (notwithstanding its title) the first entry in the Korean-made series. The player controls a different spaceship in every mission, though they play nearly identically (with the exception of the range of the smart bombs). Different weapons and power-ups (such as a life-adding item) can be collected throughout the stages. Each mission ends with a boss battle. The game features three selectable difficulty levels.</description>
