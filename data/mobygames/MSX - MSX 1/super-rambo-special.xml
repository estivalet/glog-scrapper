        <description>&lt;i&gt;Super Rambo Special&lt;/i&gt; is an action game based on  movie &lt;i&gt;Rambo: First Blood Part 2&lt;/i&gt;. As in the movie you play the part of one-man-army John Rambo who is busted out of prison by his former CO to go deep into the Vietnamese jungle and rescue a group of P.O.W.s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You control Rambo from a top-down perspective as he explores the jungle looking for keys and avoiding enemy patrols, the keys allow you to unlock the many huts you will come across in the jungle and must be explored to release the P.O.W.s and gather weapons and munitions in order to raise some hell, as your trusty knife is not going to cut it against all those Vietnamese and Russian soldiers.</description>
