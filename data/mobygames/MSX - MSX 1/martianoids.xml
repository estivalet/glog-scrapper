        <description>After a long journey, robot ship Markon Dawn is attacked by the martianoids aliens which disrupt the passage of programs, destroy active components in the ships brain and drain your battery in attempt to destroy your ship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your mission is to defend the Markon brain from the infestation using a defence droid that has to guide programs from a transmitter to a receiver to activate the ships defences. When all nine sectors are activated, the brain is safe. The droid is equipped with lasers as a weapon against enemies, and there is a console displaying messages and a map.</description>
