        <description>Based on Nippon Sunrise's animation series of the eighties, your goal in &lt;i&gt;Vifam&lt;/i&gt; is to guide your mothership to a specific planet while surviving the assault of enemy robots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is divided into three screens, or monitors:&lt;br&gt;
Monitor 1 is a two-dimensional starmap, where you guide your ship through the planet system while avoiding being pulled into a planet's gravity field. If this happens, the game switches to a screen displaying the planet in close-up, and you must immediately accelerate out of its vicinity. The radar screen displays both approaching enemy robots and an arrow pointing to your destination. You have a limited fuel supply, so time must not be wasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the red dots on your radar come too close, you must switch to monitor 2, where you fly the robot Vifam in a first-person perspective through space in order to shoot the enemy down. After that, you can return to the mother ship and resume your voyage. Monitor 3 is used for servicing Vifam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you've reached the red planet, the game wraps around and you must do the same voyage again.</description>
