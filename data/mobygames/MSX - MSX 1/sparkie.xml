        <description>Sparkie is a action game where you need to clear a level to get to the next. Each screen is one level. To clear the level you either need to make the entire level blue, which you do simply by walking around, or eradicate all fiery enemies that can spark your fuse. For this your able to shoot water at them. The small flames can be quickly extinguished, but new ones keep appearing as long as you do not extinguish the fires they come out of. The larger enemies require several hits. Also pay attention to blocks changing colour to red, that means it is about to combust and an enemy will appear there.</description>
