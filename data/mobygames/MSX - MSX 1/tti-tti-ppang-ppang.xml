        <description>&lt;i&gt;Tti Tti! Ppang Ppang!&lt;/i&gt; is a simple Korean-made continuously-scrolling platformer. The player controls a car equipped with a propeller; it is impossible to stop it, but the player can choose to change its direction and jump to avoid enemies and obstacles. The game consists of three stages, each populated by hostile skulls as well as stage-specific enemies such as construction cars, cuttlefish, and helicopters. After completing the three stages the player is taken back to the beginning.</description>
