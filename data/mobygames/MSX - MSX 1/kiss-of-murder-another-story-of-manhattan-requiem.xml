        <description>&lt;i&gt;Kiss of Murder&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure game set in a parallel world to &lt;a href="/game/jb-harold-series-2-manhattan-requiem-angels-flying-in-the-dark"&gt;Manhattan Requiem&lt;/a&gt;. While it features the same graphics and set of characters as that title, it has a completely different story. In Manhattan a large blue sapphire has been stolen and a young woman named Sarah Shields who worked at a jewelry store has been murdered. Insurance investigator Judd Gregory has contacted the private detective &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=J%2eB%2e+Harold"&gt; J.B. Harold&lt;/a&gt; and asked him for help with the case. Gameplay involves going to various locations in New York, talking to people, interrogating suspects, finding clues and gathering evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Early releases of the game (PC-88, X68000, FM-7, X1 and PC-98) are add-ons and require Manhattan Requiem to play. Later iterations became stand-alone.</description>
