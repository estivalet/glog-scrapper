        <description>The famous crazy-scientist Dr. Bacterio was experimenting with hens to let them grow to the size of a horse, thus trying definitively to end the hunger in the world.  But, as was habitual in his experiments, he had failed in his objective and now a gang of uncontrolled hens is circulating around the city putting eggs on the street.  But certain special eggs have the capacity to turn one person into a hen (or at least that's what they believed) if the egg crushes on his head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is the sequel of the first game dedicated to the famous IbaÃ±ez's comicbook saga, &amp;quot;Mortadelo y FilemÃ³n&amp;quot;, known as &amp;quot;Clever &amp;amp; Smart&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Flip &amp;amp; Flop&amp;quot; outside Spain.</description>
