        <description>Life in the Fast Lane can best be described as a cross between &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Trailblazer"&gt;Trailblazer&lt;/a&gt;, for its bouncy ball on a chequered path action, and &lt;a href="/game/elektraglide"&gt;Elektraglide&lt;/a&gt; for its twisty road and futuristic enemies and obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your task is simple: Travel as far as you can on the road inside your rolling sphere. There are obstacles in the road that you must avoid, either by going to the left or right or by jumping over them. Unlike Trailblazer, you can jump a whole lot, even to the point of virtually flying above the level. Not even then are you safe, though, since airplanes will attack you in the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ground has holes in it. If you miscalculate a leap, and fall into a black hole, you are dropped into something very much like &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Tempest"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;, with your sphere moving across the outer edge of a space tunnel, shooting at the things that come out of it. If you fall into a water-filled hole, you fall through the road and find that it runs above a river. Here, you are attacked by fish, but luckily you can shoot back at them (something you cannot do on the ground). The next time there is a whole in the ground, you have a chance to resurface. All the while, you must make sure not to expend your jumping and shooting power bars, or you will be left vulnerable.</description>
