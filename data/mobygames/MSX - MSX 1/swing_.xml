        <description>In Swing you control a man that has to wash the windows of several skyscrapers.
Dirty windows have a grey color and clean windows are blue.
The skycraper's windows form a sort of maze-like pattern as you can only climb up or down on or next to a window.
While washing the windows of the skyscrapers you are pursued by several hostile monsters and if they catch you, you 'll lose a life. 
When all windows are cleaned you have to enter the skyscraper through the front door to go to the next round.</description>
