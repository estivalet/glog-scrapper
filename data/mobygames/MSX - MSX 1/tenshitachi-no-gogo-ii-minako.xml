        <description>The sequel to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Tenshitachi+no+Gogo+MSX"&gt; Tenshitachi no Gogo&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;switches sides&amp;quot;; instead of playing as the obnoxious male protagonist of the previous game, the player takes control of Minako, a female Japanese high-school student with a strong interest towards sexuality. The story mainly depicts Minako's sexual encounters with men and women, which take place on school grounds, in various locations of the city, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tenshitachi no Gogo 2: Minako&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure game that has both text input and a set of verb commands (&amp;quot;Search&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;, etc.) attached to the function keys. There are no puzzles, but not every event in the game can be triggered by using the pre-set commands; often it is required to type in other verbs, using hiragana (Japanese syllable system) input via the keyboard.</description>
