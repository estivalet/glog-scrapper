        <description>The city of Palma has always been protected by the spirits of the four elements. However, Dolgo, the spirit of the earth, revolts and makes off with the Life Seeker, the controller of the world's life energies, to his underground lair. In doing so, the people of Palma begin to lose their very souls. The spirit of the air has ordered that a champion needs to be found, to retrieve the Life Seeker from the clutches of Dolgo. You are that champion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zombie Hunter&lt;/i&gt; is an action role-playing game, somewhat similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Zelda+II"&gt;Zelda II&lt;/a&gt; with its side-scrolling battles. You receive experience from defeating your enemies and you have an inventory complete with armor and weapons.</description>
