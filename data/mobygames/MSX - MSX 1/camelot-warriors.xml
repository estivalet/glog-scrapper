        <description>If you dare to cross the threshold of mystery, forget everything that you know, because you will go into in a trip without return. Past and future worlds, black magic, hidden traps - take your sword with a lot of courage and never throw a glance back. Four elements from the 20th century have entered the world of Camelot: &amp;quot;The voice of another world&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Wisdom mirror&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The life elixir&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The fire that doesn't burn&amp;quot;. You must take them and present them to the guardians of each world, who will be in charge of their destruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Camelot Warriors&lt;/i&gt; is an action game with platforming elements. You must travel through four different worlds populated by many enemies. Forests, lakes, caverns and finally, the Castle of Camelot are awaiting you.</description>
