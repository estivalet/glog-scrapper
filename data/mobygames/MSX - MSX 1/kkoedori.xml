        <description>&lt;i&gt;Kkoedori&lt;/i&gt; is a Korean-made action puzzle game similar in concept to &lt;a href="/game/solomons-key"&gt;Solomon's Key&lt;/a&gt;. The player must construct and destroy blocks in order to access the key that opens the door to the next stage. As opposed to &lt;i&gt;Solomon's Key&lt;/i&gt;, blocks can only be built diagonally upwards, like stairs. Deleted blocks can be used to trap wandering enemies. The protagonist can also wear armor that protects him from projectile attacks. </description>
