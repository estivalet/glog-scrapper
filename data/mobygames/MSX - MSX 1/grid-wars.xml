        <description>Grid Wars is best described as a cross between classic Jeff Minter games such as &lt;a href="/game/gridrunner"&gt;Gridrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Pac-Man"&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/a&gt;. The playfield looks and sounds just like Gridrunner or &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Matrix"&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. In the middle of the grid is your space ship, and on all four sides of the grid are moving cannons which will try to shoot you down. Your task is to avoid the fire coming from all directions, while picking up the &amp;quot;energon cubes&amp;quot; that will let your ship fly to the next level. With so much happening on screen and the clean graphics, this looks like something Mr. Minter forgot in his desk drawer some day back in 1984.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grid Wars was made for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.</description>
