        <description>After the evil Nikademus was defeated, the land of Scandor enjoyed a time period of peace, which lasted twenty years. However, when a ship sent to the Skull Island disappeared without trace, Scandor's inhabitants realized a new threat was rising...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Phantasie IV: The Birth of Heroes&lt;/i&gt; is the fourth entry in the RPG series &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Phantasie"&gt; Phantasie&lt;/a&gt;, and the only one that was released exclusively for Japanese computers. Gameplay-wise and visually, the game is very similar to the previous installments. The player creates a party of adventurers (up to six active combatants, including the series' trademark &amp;quot;random creatures&amp;quot;, such as ogres, minotaurs, lizardmen, etc.), which then roams the top-down world-map, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. Battles allow specific commands such as &amp;quot;Thrust&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Parry&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Throw&amp;quot;, etc., and - similarly to the &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=phantasie+III"&gt;third game&lt;/a&gt; - placement of the characters in rows on the battle screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new feature is the possibility to choose parents for the characters the player creates. They can both belong to the same race, or produce an offspring in a mixed marriage - which, naturally, influences the newborn's parameters, affinities, etc. Theoretically, it is possible to create a party that consists entirely of children born to troll fathers and gnoll mothers; however, these &amp;quot;random creatures&amp;quot; (unlike the privileged races such as humans, dwarves, and elves) can only be either thieves or fighters.</description>
