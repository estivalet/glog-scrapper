        <description>The second game in the &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Can+can+bunny"&gt; Can Can Bunny&lt;/a&gt; series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. &amp;quot;Oh, if only I could get her&amp;quot;, sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi's wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compared to the first game, &lt;i&gt;Can Can Bunny Superior&lt;/i&gt; plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;, etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.</description>
