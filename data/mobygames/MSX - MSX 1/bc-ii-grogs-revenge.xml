        <description>Thor has completed his &lt;a href="/game/bcs-quest-for-tires"&gt;Quest for Tires&lt;/a&gt;. Now he must discover the
Meaning of Life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it won't be easy. The Meaning of Life is hidden away; somewhere in a long maze of mountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each mountain is covered with clams and Thor needs to gather 100 clams in order to pay the tolls and advance through each mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way to Peter and the toll bridge is through the &amp;quot;real scary
caves&amp;quot;. There are lots of clams in the caves but watch out for
stalagmites. Keep Thor's headlight sweeping back and forth for
maximum clams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of the cave, watch out for Grog, who saves clams from Thor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thor also has contend with rocks, potholes and pterodactyls (they'll
eat his wheel) in his Quest for Clams and the Meaning of Life.</description>
