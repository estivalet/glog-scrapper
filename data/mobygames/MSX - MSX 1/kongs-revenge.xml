        <description>&lt;i&gt;Kong's Revenge&lt;/i&gt; is an action game based on &lt;a href="/game/donkey-kong"&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/a&gt;. It is divided into two parts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first part, the player must climb to the top of five buildings and must defeat one of Kong's minions on each one. Throughout the level, the player must avoid barrels and fire balls, and activate levers to move platforms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second part, which can only be accessed when the first one is completed, is a simple side-scrolling run 'n' gun game. While still avoiding barrels and other objects, the player must shoot at enemies. Finally, they have to defeat Kong and save the girl.</description>
