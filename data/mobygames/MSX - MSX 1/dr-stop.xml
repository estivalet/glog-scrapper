        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Dr. Stop!&lt;/i&gt; you control Takumi, who works in a hospital and whose mind is mostly occupied with female patients, most of whom are young and pretty. One day, during a visit to a patient, an explosion occurs. Who caused it - one of the patients or an outsider, or maybe a staff member? It's up to you to investigate, and win the affection of your lovely patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Stop!&lt;/i&gt; is a traditional first-person anime-style Japanese adventure. You interact with the game by selecting commands from a menu. In some of the rooms you'll see backgrounds, while others have text-only descriptions. You move around the hospital by selecting destinations from a menu while looking at the hospital map.</description>
