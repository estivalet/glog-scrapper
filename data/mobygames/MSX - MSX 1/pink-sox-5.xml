        <description>&lt;i&gt;Pink Sox 5&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi adventure &lt;i&gt;Who Is There&lt;/i&gt;, its story advancing towards darker themes, as well as a very short non-interactive episode of &lt;i&gt;Halftime Lover&lt;/i&gt;.  The mini-adventure &lt;i&gt;Balancing Beam of Love&lt;/i&gt;, depicting the sexual experiences of a school girl, continues in a slightly different format with a point-and-click interface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other mini-games are different from those included in the previous volumes. They are: a simple action game entitled &lt;i&gt;Monkey-Mankey-Baby&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;), in which the player controls a monkey and must imitate the movements of a comical human character by pressing different keys; a simple (no betting) poker game where getting better combinations removes lines obscuring an erotic picture; and a board game named &lt;i&gt;Adultic Time&lt;/i&gt;, in which the player has to position fitting items on a board to match a character (e.g. a GameBoy for a school boy) to defeat an AI-controlled opponent who is trying to do the same.</description>
