        <description>We play as a hero who has to go inside the abandoned nuclear power station on the edge of a meltdown to shut the reactor off and to prevent a major catastrophe. We have to find and/or fight our way through the robotic guards gone crazy and many other strange creatures that probably got influenced by a high radiation level. The hero has a laser pistol, but the ammo is limited, so that we should shoot on special occasions only. Instead, we have to look for and use several objects, like poison bottles, floppy disks, keys etc. - carried one at a time, they can help us to overcome the many obstacles.</description>
