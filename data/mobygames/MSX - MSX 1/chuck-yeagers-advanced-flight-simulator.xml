        <description>In &lt;i&gt;Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer&lt;/i&gt; you have the chance to test pilot 14 different airplanes, such as the Bell X-1 and the Lockheed SR-71. It features 10 different viewpoints both inside and outside of the plane, with a zoom of up to 256x, and different aerodynamics for each plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can do different things with the planes, from racing against a computer opponent, to practising formation and stunt flights. You can follow the testing and development programme through its evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a &amp;quot;black box recorder&amp;quot; to replay your flights, and analysis of your performance compared to an ideal one.</description>
