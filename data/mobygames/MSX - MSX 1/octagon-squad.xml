        <description>&lt;i&gt;Octagon Squad&lt;/i&gt; is a 2D top-down maze game, where the player controls several units via a special command interface. His mission is to rescue survivors from a chemical attack on Planet 54.7. He controls Equadroid's squad and must block off the maze exits. The gameplay is quite standard, based on locked doors, avoiding enemies, and finding keys. Each Equadroid has limited strength, so player must be careful in his moves.</description>
