        <description>The third entry in Zemina's unlicensed conversions of early &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Mario"&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/a&gt; games differs from its predecessors by having its own levels. While the two first games imported levels of their correspondent Mario counterparts, &lt;i&gt;Super Boy III&lt;/i&gt; does not copy the stages of &lt;a href="/game/super-mario-bros-3"&gt;Super Mario Bros 3.&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it utilizes elements from previous Mario games as well as &lt;a href="/game/super-mario-world"&gt;Super Mario World&lt;/a&gt;, from where some enemies and level design ingredients are borrowed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike those two games, however, &lt;i&gt;Super Boy III&lt;/i&gt;  has completely linear levels that must be traversed in a particular order. There are no special levels such as castles, no familiar bonuses, and no power-ups besides those that were introduced in the &lt;a href="/game/super-mario-bros"&gt;first Mario&lt;/a&gt; game. Mario also walks and runs significantly slower than in Nintendo games. At the end of each stage Mario has to defeat a Hammer Brother.</description>
