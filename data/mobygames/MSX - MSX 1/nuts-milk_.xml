        <description>Unlike the &lt;a href="/game/nes/nuts-milk"&gt;Famicom version&lt;/a&gt;, the home computer version of &lt;i&gt;Nuts &amp;amp; Milk&lt;/i&gt; is viewed from a top-down perspective and the character (Milk) can walk in four directions. As such, all platforming elements are removed from the game and the emphasis is more on puzzle-solving. The overall goal is the same - collect all fruit onscreen while avoiding baddies, and after that collect the heart to end the level. There are different types of terrain, and the enemies can only traverse blue type of terrain. Unfortunately, the protagonist leaves behind a blue trail, so the player needs to use strategy to successfully complete his task.</description>
