        <description>Once again Epyx invites players to compete in winter Olympics. This time there are 8 events which can be played, which are: Figure Skating, Cross Country Skiing, Speed Skating, Ski Jumping, Slalom, Downhill Skiing and Luge. Up to 8 players can either play the complete Olympics, compete in one or more events or simply practice an event. Some events can be played simultaneously (Cross Country Skiing, Slalom and Speed Skating) while the others have to be played one after another. </description>
