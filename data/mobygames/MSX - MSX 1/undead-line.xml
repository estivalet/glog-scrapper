        <description>&lt;i&gt;Undead Line&lt;/i&gt; is a top-down arcade shooter with scrolling screens, like &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Senjou+No+Ookami"&gt;Commando&lt;/a&gt; and other games. The player controls a character (from a selection of three on the MSX 2 version) that shoots projectiles at enemy monsters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six levels available are presented in a menu and can be selected and played in any order. There is a boss battle at the end of each one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chests with power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. They open when shot, and in the Genesis version it is possible to cycle through the available power-ups by keeping firing at them. The power-ups include armor and speed boosts, and several types of projectiles.</description>
