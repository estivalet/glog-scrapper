        <description>&lt;i&gt;Topografie Wereld&lt;/i&gt; is a Dutch educational program which was used in the '80s to help primary school children learn their geography of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three options to choose from, which are Opzoeken (Look up), Overhoring (Quiz) and Helikopterspel (The Helicopter Game). The game use a mid 1980s map of the world, so there are countries that still exists in that time like the Soviet Union.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Look Up mode the player can type in places and the game will automatically go to the right place on the map. In the Quiz Mode the player has to name the places that has been pointed out by the computer in a certain time. In the Helicopter game player controls a helicopter and has to fly within a certain time limit to find the places around the world that have been indicated by the computer. These places will only appear if you are close enough. Each place that have been found you'll get points. If the points are high enough, the player will get extra time and smaller places in the next level.</description>
