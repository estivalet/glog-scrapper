        <description>Just like the two previous Cybernetic Hi-School games, the third part is a strip quiz game. This time, it is centred upon Gainax's famous &lt;i&gt;Gunbuster&lt;/i&gt; animation videos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You, as an alpha-class &lt;i&gt;Top&lt;/i&gt;, are supposed to win three keys to pilot the Great Gunbuster robot against the cosmic threat to humanity. The keys are held by Jung-Freud, Kazumi &lt;i&gt;(oneesama)&lt;/i&gt; and Noriko, and you must retrieve the keys by defeating each character in a quiz game, which has the side-effect of stripping them of all their clothes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each character asks questions around a certain theme; Jung-Freud asks about the Soviet Union and military technology, Kazumi asks about fashion and Noriko asks about cult science fiction and animation.</description>
