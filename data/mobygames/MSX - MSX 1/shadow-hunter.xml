        <description>Yoshizawa, a famous writer, is targeted by a madman. She has been receiving threatening messages for a while, and comes to you, a police investigator. You start the investigation at her house, where things take a dramatic turn when her housekeeper tells you that Yoshizawa's assistant and niece, Rika, hasn't left her room for the entire day. As you break the door, you find Rika dead on the floor. The madman has found his first victim...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shadow Hunter&lt;/i&gt; is a graphical adventure game using principles common to Japanese adventures of its age, quite similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Icom"&gt;Icom's&lt;/a&gt; adventures such as &lt;a href="/game/deja-vu-a-nightmare-comes-true"&gt;DÃ©jÃ  vu&lt;/a&gt;, where you have a graphical view occupying most of the screen, surrounded by a message box at the bottom and actions on the right. Unlike Icom's adventures, though, you cannot choose a verb on the right and then point a cursor on an object on the screen. Instead, ready-made actions are presented in an ad-hoc manner according to what is relevant to each screen. The game is filled with bad ends â e.g. if you choose to stay at the hotel, the game is ended because you're wasting time.</description>
