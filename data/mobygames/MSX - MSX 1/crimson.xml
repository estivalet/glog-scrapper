        <description>&lt;i&gt;Crimson&lt;/i&gt; is a medieval-themed role-playing game similar to &lt;a href="/game/dragon-warrior"&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/a&gt;. The player controls a lone character, a young man whose father sent him on a mission to defeat the evil monster Crimson before passing away. Exploration is done in an overhead fashion, and is divided into world map and hostile areas, which are usually maze-like and contain one or more dungeons each. In towns the hero can buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as rest in inns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike &lt;i&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/i&gt;, there are no random encounters on the world map. Exploration is non-linear, i.e. the player has access to many areas of the map from the beginning of the game.</description>
