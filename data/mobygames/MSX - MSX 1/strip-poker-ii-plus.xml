        <description>&lt;i&gt;Anco&lt;/i&gt; released their own sequel to &lt;a href="/game/strip-poker-a-sizzling-game-of-chance"&gt;Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance&lt;/a&gt; using a different interface and girls to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Strip+Poker+II"&gt;Artworx's own sequel&lt;/a&gt;. The concept is the same â two beautiful girls are your poker opponents, and they will gradually remove their clothes for you if you win. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You start with $100 and each bet starts at $5, which can be raised to $25. After a second round of cards is dealt based on how many you choose to exchange, hands are compared and winnings assigned. Donna and Sam are the included girls.</description>
