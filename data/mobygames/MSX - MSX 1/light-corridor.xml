        <description>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.</description>
