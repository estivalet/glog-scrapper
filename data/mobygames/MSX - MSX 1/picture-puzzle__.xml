        <description>This is a clone of Success Corp.'s picture crossword game &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Oekaki+Puzzle"&gt;Picture Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; for the MSX. Most of the game, including both graphics and the puzzles themselves, is copied from the Neo Geo Pocket model, with alterations to fit the new target hardware. The number of puzzles has been reduced to 45, but additional puzzles can be loaded from disk or cassette.</description>
