        <description>&lt;i&gt;Dragon's Eye&lt;/i&gt; is an installment in the tile-matching game series initiated by &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Activision"&gt;Activision&lt;/a&gt;.  Players try to remove mahjong tiles in pairs from a set pattern.  Different versions of the game have up to eight different tile sets, twelve patterns based on the animals of the Chinese zodiac, and a layout editor for creating patterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the standard mode, the game also features &amp;quot;Dragon's Eye&amp;quot;, a two-player Shanghai variant.  Players take turns adding and removing tiles from a small field with one player attempting to remove all the tiles and the other trying to position tiles to make this impossible.</description>
