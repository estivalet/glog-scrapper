        <description>&lt;i&gt;KujakuÅ&lt;/i&gt; is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the late eighties and drawn by &lt;a href="/search/quick?developer=Makoto+Ogino"&gt;Makoto Ogino&lt;/a&gt;. The story is centered around the demon-hunting Buddhist monk Kujaku, who gets send out by his master to investigate rumors about attacks on a nearby temple, which ultimately leads him on a quest to stop a demon clan from summoning their Dark Lord into the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is a menu-based adventure game with verbs like &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speak&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;look&amp;quot; being the first menu choice, followed by objects/nouns in subsequent menus. From time to time Kujaku encounters enemies which he has to battle in a short combat sequences, which work similar to turn-based RPGs from that era (&lt;a href="/game/nes/dragon-warrior"&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/a&gt;). During combats, options are limited to fight, run away or use one of several prayers, which work as sort of magical spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game's story and gameplay resembles Sega's &lt;a href="/game/sega-master-system/kujaku"&gt;KujakuÅ&lt;/a&gt; version for the Sega Master System, at least to its adventure part, because there are no action sequences in this version of the game.</description>
