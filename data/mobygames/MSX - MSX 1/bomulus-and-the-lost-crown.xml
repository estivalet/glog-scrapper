        <description>The third &lt;i&gt;Bomulus&lt;/i&gt; game is a walk-and-pickup adventure based on the same general principle as Atari's original &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/game/atari-2600/adventure"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of moving between rooms in a castle, picking up objects and looking for a special item â in this case, it's a crown. The castle features many rooms and deadly dogs, dragons, fires, spiders and cooks. Items you pick up on your way to the crown will help you foil the enemies, and many rooms contain parchments with a letter. These spell a password, which you will need on your way out with the crown.</description>
