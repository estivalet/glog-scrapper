        <description>This game consists in directing an explorer through a gigantic map in the search of four coffee coats which are distributed on it. In the territory where the action takes place we can find rivers, fences, trees, rocks and some more things which can suppose an obstacle for accomplishing the mission. All that together with the presence of killer indigenous serpents which will try to finish with us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The map has 100 screens that we must cross if we want to find the four coats. Nevertheless, it's necessary to consider that at least one of them is always located inside the cave, which we will only be able to open if previously we found the key. There are also many objects distributed on the way that can help us: boats to cross rivers, tips to break rocks, machetes to cut to the vegetation, etc.</description>
