        <description>The second &lt;i&gt;Bangai-hen&lt;/i&gt; (a side story) in the &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=tenshitachi+no+gogo"&gt; Tenshitachi no Gogo&lt;/a&gt; series is set in the same environment and features recurrent characters from &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Tenshitachi+no+Gogo+3%3a+Ribbon"&gt; Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist is a high-school student, who also happens to be the brother of Haru Okamoto, the main love interest in &lt;i&gt;Ribbon&lt;/i&gt;. Like in most other games in this series, the story revolves around the main character's effort to have sex with every female character, including school mates and colleagues in part-time jobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay is identical to the one in &lt;i&gt;Ribbon&lt;/i&gt; or in the &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=tenshitachi+no+gogo+2%3a+bangai-hen"&gt; previous Bangai-hen&lt;/a&gt;: the player proceeds through still screens, typically depleting the available menu commands (verbs and object sub-menus) until a new command appears or an event is triggered. Like in most other games in the series, there are multiple dead ends and possible actions that lead to premature end of the game.</description>
