        <description>&lt;i&gt;Pelmanism&lt;/i&gt; is a game similar to memory/concentration for two to four players. The game is played on a 10 by 9 grid where a number of cards have been placed. Players take turns in flipping the cards, two at a time. If the two cards show the same symbol the player earns a point and gets to keep flipping until a pair is picked with different symbols. The game goes on until all cards have been removed from the grid and the player with the largest score will win. The number of cards to use is selected before starting: from two pairs up to forty. The game is played with the keyboard and players choose cards by entering their coordinates on the grid.</description>
