        <description>A kendo sports game - kendo is dueling with wooden swords. You can play against the computer or a friend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mode 1 there are five rounds, and you win a round by striking your opponent in the head or disarming them, twice. In mode 2, there are no rounds and each kendo practitioner has a life meter. The winner is the one to deplete his opponent's life meter. In both modes, there is a time limit on each round.</description>
