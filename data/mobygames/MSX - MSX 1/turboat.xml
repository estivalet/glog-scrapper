        <description>What do you get if you cross &lt;a href="/game/river-raid"&gt;River Raid&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="/game/zaxxon"&gt;Zaxxon&lt;/a&gt;? You get an early isometric motorboating game. You must travel in your turboat along a river infested with enemy patrol boats which shoot at you. Unlike the above-mentioned games, you can turn your boat with a fair amount of precision. This is absolutely necessary in order to avoid the enemy shots which come not only from ships, but from turrets on the shore as well. You must also avoid contact with ground, such as the small islands which float in the river. Luckily, you can shoot back at the enemy, but don't forget to look where you're going!</description>
