        <description>&lt;i&gt;Salvage&lt;/i&gt; is a text adventure with graphics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game takes place on a space ship. It's not just any space ship, this is an old convict shuttle that's been in orbit around asteroid 4-Gamma-7 for seventeen years. It's no longer used and the player takes the role of the commander of the salvage ship sent to retrieve the ship's Sequerra crystal. These crystals provide the energy in modern ion-drive are now scarce which makes the crystal in this old ship extremely valuable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game starts when the player teleports onto the old ship, an action which triggers the shuttle's security procedures. Now the only way off the ship is to track down the code which activates the shuttles own teleporter. To do so the player must find hidden clues left by former inmates as they plotted their escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game features an on-screen notepad that records key information and a save-game feature that allows partially completed games to be stored on tape.</description>
