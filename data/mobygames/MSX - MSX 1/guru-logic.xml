        <description>When &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Guru+Logic+Champ"&gt;Guru Logic Champ&lt;/a&gt; was released for the Gameboy Advance, it soon became apparent that the game was simple enough in concept to be ported to much simpler systems. One Spanish programmer took it upon himself to port the title to the humble MSX1, and released it as part of the MSXdev'03 contest. However, he never asked the then-defunct &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Compile"&gt;Compile&lt;/a&gt; for permission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game uses the exact same rules and even the same puzzles as the GBA original, as well as the original sprites. The graphics make good use of the limited power of the MSX, with many colours, and even renders the player character using multicolour sprites. Due to the limitations in the number of sprites that may be displayed, only one duck is responsible for shooting the blocks that fill in the picture that is to be completed for each level (the GBA original uses two ducks). While the game replicates the original gameplay, it lacks the storyline and does not display a coloured version of the completed pictures, something which would not fit into the 32K of memory used by the game. Instead, Guru Logic for the MSX1 concentrates on the puzzle gameplay that is central to the game, giving a clear impression of what Guru Logic Champ might have looked like had it been conceived ten years earlier.</description>
