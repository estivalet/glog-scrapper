        <description>&lt;i&gt;The Return of Ishtar&lt;/i&gt; is a sequel to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=The+Tower+of+Druaga"&gt;The Tower of Druaga&lt;/a&gt;. It is an action game with light puzzle-solving elements that requires two players. One person is in control of the maiden Ki who fights with magic and the other controls Gilgamesh, the sword-wielding knight. Search for keys and special items. The tower has a few different ways to exit, and the aggregate total of levels is 128.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Players are presented a password to allow them to continue from where they left off.</description>
