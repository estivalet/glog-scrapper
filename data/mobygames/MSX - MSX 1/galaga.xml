        <description>&lt;i&gt;Galaga&lt;/i&gt; is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a &amp;quot;challenge stage&amp;quot; in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last &amp;quot;life,&amp;quot; you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final &amp;quot;hit ratio&amp;quot;--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</description>
