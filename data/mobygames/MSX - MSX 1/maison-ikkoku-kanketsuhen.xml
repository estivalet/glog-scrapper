        <description>The game is based on the manga &lt;i&gt;Maison Ikkoku&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,132555/"&gt;Rumiko Takahashi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in Tokyo of the 80-ies, the story can be described as a romantic tale with a touch of comedy. It centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot line. The game's story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the conclusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is a &amp;quot;puzzle-less&amp;quot; adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, and Move&amp;quot; typical for Japanese adventures (no &amp;quot;Think&amp;quot; command), but also context-sensitive commands &amp;quot;Eat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Drink&amp;quot;, etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.</description>
