        <description>A 24-year-old woman was found dead in her flat in Manhattan, New York. Her skull was crushed - it was clear that she was murdered. Further investigation showed that she was working as a pianist. The police can find no clues, so it's time for the private detective &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=J%2eB%2e+Harold"&gt; J.B. Harold&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the murder and to bring the killer to justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite its Japanese origins, &lt;i&gt;Manhattan Requiem&lt;/i&gt; has realistic graphic design without any manga/anime influences. As an adventure game, it has Japanese influences (no inventory, no puzzles), as well as Western ones (relative freedom in navigation, detailed dialogue system, no &amp;quot;trigger commands&amp;quot; to advance the plot). The game plays similarly to a real investigation: the player has to question suspects, collect evidence, find new leads, after which new locations become accessible. It is also possible to review all the data collected during the investigation in-game, by going to a bar at any time.</description>
