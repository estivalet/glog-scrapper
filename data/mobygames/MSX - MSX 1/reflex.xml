        <description>This bat and ball game has 90 levels, each more difficult than the last. The blocks are worth between 5 and 250 points. As you hit the special blocks on the left hand side, you gain power-ups ranging from slowing the ball to making the ball able to go through the blocks. Also, as you are playing you need to be fast as you score starts to decrease until you complete the level and go to the next. On the B side of the game there is a level editor which you can make your own screens up.</description>
