        <description>Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different &lt;i&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/i&gt; arcade games in Japan, following the original arcade games release. Stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into &lt;i&gt;Super Lode Runner&lt;/i&gt; for the MSX. The game also kept the two-player mode from the arcade version.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game keeps the typical gameplay of the &lt;i&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/i&gt; series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This game shouldn't be confused with the NES game of the same title - it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.)</description>
