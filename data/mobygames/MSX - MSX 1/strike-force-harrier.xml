        <description>&lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1985/"&gt;Rod Hyde&lt;/a&gt; was always determined to produce the most realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, as well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.</description>
