        <description>&lt;a href="/search/quick?company=HAL+Laboratory%2c+Inc%2e"&gt;HAL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;i&gt;Hole in One&lt;/i&gt; is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective. You can compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When playing against the computer, you will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to stroke and match play, you can obtain passwords that allow you to replay any spectacular shots that you make (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).</description>
