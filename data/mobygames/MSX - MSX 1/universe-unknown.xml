        <description>In 2038 AD, the United States of America, Europe and East-Asia joined their forces in the development of space technology. The joint venture was called STAR (Space Transport And Research). One of the goals of the joint venture was to explore the possibilities of transdimensional voyages to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri. Six years later, a prototype of the transdimensional drive was completed. Test pilot Jim Benson is to take the craft on its maiden voyage. In a technical mishap, too much energy is injected into the drive, and the Einstein-Rosen bridge doesn't work out as calculated. Instead, Jim ends up in an unknown part of space unidentifiable to the board computer. &lt;i&gt;Universe: Unknown!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a game, U:U owes much inspiration to Konami's classic &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Gradius+Series"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; games for the MSX. Horizontally scrolling (albeit at a jittery pace, due to being programmed for the MSX1), your sole spaceship must shoot down wave upon wave of alien enemies. Killed enemies often leave behind upgrade capsules for your weapon. The weapons are similar to Nemesis, containing both bullets and lasers as well as bombs and auxiliary weapon pods; so-called &lt;i&gt;options&lt;/i&gt;. The weapon system differs somewhat, in that you can choose freely between different weapons as long as you have collected enough upgrade capsules. A meter at the bottom shows your current weapons energy level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a beginning in open space, you enter a system of caverns. Just like in Nemesis, this requires both precise timing and precise memorisation of evasive manoeuvres. The usual enemies, such as turrets, pods which spawn clusters of enemies, and falling pieces of the terrain are all present. Choosing the right weapon for the task helps, but manoeuvring is the decisive element in surviving the often cramped caves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This game made second place in the MSXdev '05 coding contest.</description>
