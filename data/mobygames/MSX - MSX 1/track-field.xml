        <description>&lt;i&gt;Track &amp;amp; Field&lt;/i&gt; is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</description>
