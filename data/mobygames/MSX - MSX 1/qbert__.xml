        <description>Despite it's name, this &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Q%2aBert+Series"&gt;Q*Bert installment&lt;/a&gt; is not a port of the &lt;a href="/game/arcade/qbert"&gt;first game&lt;/a&gt;, rather it's based on &lt;a href="/game/qberts-qubes"&gt;Q*Bert's Qubes&lt;/a&gt;. The player doesn't even control Q*Bert, but rather the dragon Wrappy. The gameplay is still focused on forming lines of blocks that match a target color, while enemies constantly enter the playfield. However there are now many different layouts in 50 different stages. Also added are differently colored blobs that function as power-ups when touched. Blue ones for example grant invincibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another addition are two-player simultaneous modes, where both players compete against each other, with or without enemies.
The first player to complete a line of five of his target alignment wins. If the time runs out, the relevant blocks are counted, 
a draw leads to a round of rock-paper-scissors with a random result. </description>
