        <description>Two million years ago, a spaceship crashed on what is today the Brazilian coastline. The alien survivors of the crash buried the radioactive wreck and the body of the ship's captain inside a huge rock and carved his likeness on it. On present day U.S.A., the Army starts experimenting with mind-altering technology on a few subjects. One of them enters a trance and starts relaying what happened all those years ago in Brazil. The U.S. government decides to investigate these claims by deploying troops near the Pedra da GÃ¡vea, the only structure matching the description on the Brazilian territory. An alpinist hired by the Army as a guide discovers the plot and sends secret military documents to a friend, hoping he could unveil the mystery hidden inside the rock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Lenda da GÃ¡vea&lt;/i&gt; is a text adventure from Brazil made with the &lt;a href="/game/graphic-adventure-creator"&gt;G.A.C.&lt;/a&gt; utility. The parser is not as sophisticated as the one found on &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Infocom"&gt;Infocom&lt;/a&gt; games, but it is a step-up from the verb-noun parser of &lt;a href="/search/quick?developer=Scott+Adams"&gt;Scott Adams&lt;/a&gt; adventures (it can't process chain commands, but understands pronouns).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game's main objective is to gain entrance to the GÃ¡vea rock. In order to accomplish this, the player has to collect several objects that are scattered around the area of dense vegetation surrounding it. Some of these objects are useless, intended as red-herrings. On the screen there are two pictures of a snake. As a warning, when approaching a dangerous situation they transform into pictures of an anthropomorphic figure of death. Even though the game is entirely written in first person, the game bizarrely warns about being hungry and thirsty. If the player don't drink or eat something in the game, after a few turns the death screen comes up.</description>
