        <description>This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to &lt;a href="/game/super-sprint"&gt;Super Sprint&lt;/a&gt;. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</description>
