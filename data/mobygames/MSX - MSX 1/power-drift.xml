        <description>Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? &lt;i&gt;Power Drift&lt;/i&gt; is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. Youâll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While youâre buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finish all 5 stages in a level and youâll be presented with a bonus level.</description>
