        <description>You are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Altered Beast&lt;/i&gt; title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</description>
