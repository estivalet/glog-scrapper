        <description>&lt;i&gt;Maze Max&lt;/i&gt; is a racing game similar to the arcade game &lt;a href="/game/rally-x"&gt;Rally-X&lt;/a&gt;. Like in the arcade game the players is in control of a racing car and has to drive it through a maze in search for flags. There are ten flags in the maze and they all have to be collected in order to complete the level. At the same time it is necessary to watch out for the AI controlled cars that are pursuing and trying to crash into the player's car. In addition to flags there are fuel tanks that have to be collected to avoid running out of gas. Crashing with a chasing car or running out of fuel leads to a life being lost and the player has three at the start. After a level has been completed the player moves on to the next which has one additional chasing car. The main difference from Rally-X is that it is not possible to use smoke screens to distract the cars. </description>
