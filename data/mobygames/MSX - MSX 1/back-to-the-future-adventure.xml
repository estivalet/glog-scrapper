        <description>This video game incarnation of the movie &lt;i&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/i&gt; (1985) is a Japanese-style adventure game with visual novel elements. The story follows that of the movie, putting the player in control of its protagonist Marty McFly as he accidentally travels to the past and must make his parents fall in love with each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game's visuals are composed out of digitized photos of original scenes from the movie, though the plot is more concise and many scenes are missing. Many screens offer a list of verbs (such as Look, Say, Show, Go, etc.) for the player to choose from, but usually only one action should be selected to move on to the next scenes. Other instances require the player to reply &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; to a suggested action by Marty, or offer several choices the player must choose from. Wrong choice may lead to Game Over in these cases.</description>
