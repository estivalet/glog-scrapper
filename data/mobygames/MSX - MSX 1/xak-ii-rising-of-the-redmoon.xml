        <description>Three years have passed since the brave young warrior Latok Kart defeated the evil demon Badu, bringing peace to Xak, the world of humans. But one of Badu's servants, a sorcerer known as the Necromancer, has escaped. He plans to summon another dark being, known as the Gospel, from the demon world Zekisis to the world of Xak. Meanwhile, Latok and his companion, the fairy Pixie, are on the way to the village of Banuwa, hearing the rumor that Latok's long lost father has been seen nearby...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rising of the Redmoon&lt;/i&gt; is the sequel to &lt;a href="/game/xak-the-art-of-visual-stage"&gt; The Art of Visual Stage&lt;/a&gt; and the second entry in the &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Xak"&gt; Xak&lt;/a&gt; series. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor: Latok wanders through hostile areas, fighting enemies in action melee combat, gaining experience points and leveling up. A few options have been added, such as praying to Duel, a legendary god of war, to restore hit points.</description>
