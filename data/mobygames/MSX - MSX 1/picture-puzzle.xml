        <description>&lt;i&gt;Picture Puzzle&lt;/i&gt; is a puzzle game.  The player has to reconstruct an image that is cut out in 16 pieces and one of those pieces is not present.
They can only move one piece at the time and only towards the missing piece. The pictures to reconstruct are cartoon style animal pictures such as a crocodile, a cat, a pig, a horse and elephant.
It can be played by one or two players.</description>
