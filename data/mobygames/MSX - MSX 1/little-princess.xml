        <description>You are Kentarou Kogawa, a Japanese high-school student. One day you meet your girlfriend and the two of you go to the park. Suddenly, a dark winged being descends and kidnaps your girlfriend! Following the beast, you step through a portal and find yourself in a mysterious world. Will you be able to save your girlfriend and find a way home?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a first-person anime-style Japanese adventure. You interact with the environment by typing commands (Japanese keyboard allows typing of &lt;i&gt;katakana&lt;/i&gt; syllables). Movement is also done by typing direction commands (&amp;quot;North&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;West&amp;quot;, etc.)</description>
