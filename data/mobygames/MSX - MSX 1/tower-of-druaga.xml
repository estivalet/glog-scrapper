        <description>You control a heroic knight, who is actually prince Gilgamesh, who must attempt to rescue the maiden from the demon Druaga. You are armed with a sword and shield to attack and defend.
You move from floor to floor, which are constructed as mazes, searching for the key; this key will unlock the stage exit.
Items can be found by killing (all) enemies.</description>
