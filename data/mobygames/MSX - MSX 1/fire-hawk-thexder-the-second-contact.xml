        <description>&lt;i&gt;Fire Hawk: Thexder - The Second Contact&lt;/i&gt; is the sequel to &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Thexder"&gt;Thexder&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Fire Hawk robot has the same main design as Thexder: a laser, shield and the ability to transform into a jet. It's also possible to use some special weapons which can be found during the missions, such as the Flasher, (damages anything on screen) and the Stopper (freezes enemies for a while).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Levels are divided into sub-levels, with each fourth one featuring a boss fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the main improvements compared to the original game include the ability to save a game at certain points, the ability to switch between special weapons during gameplay, and a greatly expanded high-quality soundtrack.</description>
