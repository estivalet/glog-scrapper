        <description>&lt;i&gt;The 4th Unit 2&lt;/i&gt; is a direct sequel to &lt;a href="/game/4th-unit"&gt;The 4th Unit&lt;/a&gt;. The young and pretty bionic soldier Blon-Win has exposed the dark schemes of the trade organization WWWF. However, a new conspiracy is rising. WWWF has employed another bionic soldier, a young woman named Dalzy, who manages to seal Blon-Win's psychic powers. Blon-Win is arrested by WWWF and must find a way to contact her friends, escape, and defeat the treacherous organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sequel follows the same gameplay format, being a predominantly puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure with an interface that combines menu-based verb selection and interaction with objects and characters highlighted on-screen. Compared to the previous games, the gameplay is more streamlined and the menu contains less commands. Rarely used options such as answering &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; during dialogues or the command &amp;quot;Rescue&amp;quot; have been eliminated.</description>
