        <description>Electric Software's Buzz Off! is a basic one player arcade game starring Bertie The Bee.
Bertie The Bee loves ripe and sweet fruits and when he sees it, he must have it. No matter what. He flies to a fruity place where a big spider has build his web. Doesn't Bertie know or doesn't he just care?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You control Bertie across the screen and must collect pieces of fruit. When you've eaten a piece of fruit it will be replaced by a portion of the spider's web and when you get tangled in it you'll die and the spider comes down to grab and eat you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are ten levels of difficulty ranging from 0 to 9. When the easiest difficulty level is selected the web of the spider is not visible at the start of a game. The higher difficulty level you select the more visible will the spiders web be.</description>
