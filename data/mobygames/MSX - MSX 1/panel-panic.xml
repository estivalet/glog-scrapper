        <description>&lt;i&gt;Panel Panic&lt;/i&gt; is a clone of Konami's old &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Amidar"&gt;Amidar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. You are a small jellyfish-like thing on a grid. You can only move on the lines of the grid, and as you move, you leave a coloured line behind. When you manage to colour all sides of a cell, it is lit up. When the entire grid is coloured, and therefore all cells are lit up, you have finished the level. Of course, there are nasties following you around, so you have to navigate smartly if you don't want to be caught.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the game progresses, the speed and number of the baddies is increased, but so is your speed. There are also bonus levels, where you gain extra lives by catching a baddie within a time limit.</description>
