        <description>In &lt;em&gt;Empire City: 1931&lt;/em&gt; which is set in 1931 you are a federal agent that has to eliminate all criminal activities in New York City.
You must hunt the criminals down and shoot them one by one. To locate a criminal you just have to follow the arrow on the left or right of the screen. Killing criminals is done by moving the cross hair over them.
A countdown timer will start counting down if a criminal starts shooting at you. You must kill the criminal before the timer reaches zero or you'll loose a life.
New bullets can be collected by shooting at the bullet boxes that regularly appear in the game as other useful objects.
The criminals sometimes take hostages for protection. Rescue these hostages for additional points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firing your gun is done with fire button 1 and deflecting bullets by pressing the fire button 2.</description>
