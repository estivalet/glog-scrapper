        <description>Turbo Girl, well-known by that name in all the Galaxy, lieutenant of the body of immediate intervention of the korg army, has been chosen to fulfill a suicidal mission: Three &amp;quot;Elder&amp;quot; (strange cybernetic beings) intercept the provisions of the colony supported by a ship-robot army; she must destroy them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cross the different levels avoiding to be demolished by the ship-robots and finish every &amp;quot;Elder&amp;quot; which all of them are protecting. The game consists of three levels very differentiated, and each one is divided as well in several parts that will allow you to continue from one of them when beaten.</description>
