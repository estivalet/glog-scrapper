        <description>The Milk Race involved cycling 1000 miles across Britain, and the game simulates being one of the 84 entrants. The route takes you form Newcastle to London via Sheffield, Birmingham and Ipswich among others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The roads are strewn with potholes, and cars and other bikes make things more treacherous. Time-trials are sprung on you at random, and these must be completed in the allotted time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You canât cycle at full pelt for the whole event and you need to make efficient use of energy, via pacing yourself and riding in higher gears when you reach hills, are vital. Milk (what else?) can be picked up to boost your energy.
