        <description>&lt;i&gt;Pink Sox 7&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It contains another very short episode in the &lt;i&gt;Halftime Lover&lt;/i&gt; series; like in the few previous installments, it is non-interactive. Otherwise all the mini-games in this volume are new. A mini-adventure entitled &lt;i&gt;G Gun-Cannon&lt;/i&gt; introduces characters seen in other Pink Sox mini-games before (such as Sayaka from &lt;i&gt;Balancing Beam of Love&lt;/i&gt;), and is mostly dedicated to lesbian sex between high school girls. Another very simple Japanese-style adventure is an erotic variation on the Red Riding Hood tale. Finally, there is also a simple slot machine mini-game.</description>
