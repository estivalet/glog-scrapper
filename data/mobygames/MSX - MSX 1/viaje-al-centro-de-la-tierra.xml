        <description>In this &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,61309/"&gt;Jules Verne&lt;/a&gt; inspired game you are gonna take a journey to the center of the earth.
This game consist of three parts.
In the first part you have to solve a puzzle by putting the parts in the correct order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second part you control three characters at the same time. Each character carries its own objects and attributes, while they enter the volcano on their way to the center of the earth. They have to pass water cascades, geysers and eventually a lake with a monster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the third part you have to choose one of the three ways to get to the surface of the earth.
Each route is different and has its own dangers like tigers, carnivorous plants and quick sand.</description>
