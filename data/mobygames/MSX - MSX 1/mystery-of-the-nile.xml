        <description>In this unofficial adaptation of the film &amp;quot;The Jewel of the Nile&amp;quot;, three travelers have been captured by a dictatorial regime in an Arab country. They must escape the country at once, and the player is the only one who can help them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the initial screens all three tourists need to be reunited from their different prison cells. Each character also needs to find their weapon of choice, those being grenades, a pistol and an umbrella. Control between any of the travelers can be switched at any moment by typing 1, 2 or 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the three travelers are reunited, every screen acts as a puzzle of sorts: the player is given a few seconds to strategically place each character before enemies appear. When they do, two of the characters will react automatically to the enemies, and the player will directly control the last character. If all enemies in the screen are eliminated and the three characters survive, they will advance to the next screen.</description>
