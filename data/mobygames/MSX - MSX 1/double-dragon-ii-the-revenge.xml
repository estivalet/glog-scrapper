        <description>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp;amp; Jimmy Lee in &lt;a href="/search/quick?game=Double+Dragon"&gt;the first Double Dragon game&lt;/a&gt;, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original arcade version of &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up &lt;a href="/game/renegade"&gt;Renegade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.</description>
