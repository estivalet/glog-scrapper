        <description>&lt;i&gt;Fukujinzuke&lt;/i&gt; has little to do with the Japanese pickled vegetables it was named after. Rather, it is a small humorous mini-game tribute to Humming Bird's role-playing game &lt;a href="/game/record-of-lodoss-war-haiiro-no-majo"&gt;Record of Lodoss War: Haiiro no Majo&lt;/a&gt;. Besides a sound gallery feature, the game consists of three mini-games. The first is a puzzle which requires the player to assemble a picture by sliding disarranged fragments of it one at a time. The second is a recreation of a typical battle from the role-playing game, featuring a party of high-level characters entering a castle and fighting enemies in a turn-based encounter identical to those of &lt;i&gt;Haiiro no Majo&lt;/i&gt;. The third mini-game is a quiz concerning all things related to Record of Lodoss War.</description>
