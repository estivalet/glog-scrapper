        <description>&lt;i&gt;Fire Hawk&lt;/i&gt; is a side scrolling space shoot-em-up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player takes on the role of a pilot who has been chosen from many to fly the Fire Hawk prototype. The mission is to take the ship to the Zeus galaxy and fly through six tough planetary defence systems. 
Each stage is timed. The ship will run low on fuel but additional fuel can be picked up along the way.
