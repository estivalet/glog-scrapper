        <description>Based on &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,445455/"&gt;FranÃ§ois Bourgeon&lt;/a&gt;'s French comic book series from the '80s, the game follows the series' plot very closely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the French Revolution is about to begin, Hoel and Isa find themselves in Brittany after a series of unfortunate events. They will face a thousand dangers, travel from the European to the African shores, in a quest to discover truth about Isa's real identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player controls, in turn, the actions of the daring heroine, the courageous and loving sailor, and more than fifteen other characters living towards the end of the eighteenth century.</description>
