        <description>Combining the gameplay of an arcade shoot'em'up with watching pretty girls, &lt;i&gt;Girl's Control&lt;/i&gt; puts you in a spaceship, battling hordes of enemies flying downwards. All that flies is not an enemy, though; you can also shoot at blocks that, when shot, make up a picture of a pretty girl on the right of the screen. Picking up bonuses in the shape of the signs for &amp;quot;pretty girl&amp;quot; powers up your weapon. When all pieces of the picture are picked up, you are given a chance to enjoy the picture at your own pace before progressing to the next level (and the next girl). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gameplay can be spiced up by upgrading your spaceship into a much more &amp;quot;phallic&amp;quot; configuration, with bullets looking like big sperm, while the enemies come in the shape of scissors, mouths, pants and syringes. Your ship can also gain a condom shield. Whereas the MSX version starts off like a more normal shooter, progressively becoming more vulgar, this is the default mode in the Famicom version.</description>
