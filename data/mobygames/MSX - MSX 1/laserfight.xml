        <description>&lt;i&gt;Laserfight!&lt;/i&gt; is a horizontally-scrolling shooter that is exceptionally similar to the classic &lt;a href="/game/gradius"&gt;Gradius&lt;/a&gt;. The visual design and power-up system are both reminiscent of Konami's well-known title. There is a gauge along the bottom of the screen which increases when a power-up is picked up. Each level of the gauge will activate a different weapon, with the last level switching to another set of weapons. There are three weapon sets in all for a total of nine weapons, including lasers, reflect shots, and 4-way shots; each weapon set also has a &amp;quot;speed up&amp;quot; option. Gradius' trademark ship-following &amp;quot;options&amp;quot; are also present. Each stage consists of numerous obstacles and enemies which must be destroyed and maneuvered around. At the end of each stage is a large boss.</description>
