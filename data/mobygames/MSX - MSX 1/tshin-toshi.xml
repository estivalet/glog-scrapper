        <description>You play the role of a young boy named Custom. You've always liked fighting, but haven't quite found a way to develop your talents. One day, wandering through the country, you meet a beautiful girl named Kumiko, who tells you about the Battling Gods Championship in her town. The conditions sound good enough for Custom, but soon he realizes that he is too weak to participate, and has to descend into nearby dungeons to fight monsters and to become stronger, having more chances to win the big prize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;TÅshin Toshi&lt;/i&gt; is an erotic animÃ©-style RPG similar to &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Rance"&gt; Rance&lt;/a&gt; series, and set in the same universe. Navigation in town and dialogues with characters are done from first-person view. In dungeons, the perspective switches to top-down. You explore the dungeons and fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. In the town, you can stay in the inn, buy supplies, or enter the tournament in the Colosseum.</description>
