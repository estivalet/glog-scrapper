        <description>&lt;i&gt;Guillermo Tell&lt;/i&gt; is a shooting game made exclusively for use with a Spanish lightgun called Gunstick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is similar to &lt;a href="/game/arcade/crossbow"&gt;Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. Like in that title, the main character walks automatically (he must rescue his beloved) and the player has the mission (more or less in the role of a gunman bodyguard) to protect Guillermo from the attacks of archers, trolls, birds and also from the impact of objects like stones or bows.</description>
