        <description>The sequel to &lt;a href="/game/colossal-adventure"&gt;Colossal Adventure&lt;/a&gt; is an interactive fiction game with a VERB NOUN interface. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fantasy setting takes a clear influence from &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=Lord+of+the+Rings"&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;. After centuries of harmony, Middle Earth has hit problems due to a cataclysmic sequence of events - a crop failure leading to animals turning violent, and then an attack from a mysterious enemy to the north. The evil Demon Lord Alagiarept is discovered to be responsible, and as such the Wizards are given a week to beat him, before Middle Earth must surrender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You play a rookie magician with Meditation, Mysticism and
Moneymaking skills. While the main war goes on, you attempt a much bolder mission - locate the four Stones-of-the-Elements and the Medallion of Life to enter Alagiarept's Dark Tower and kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your quest will take you through Beaches, Moors and Rocky Outcrops, as well as more specific locations such as the Pillar in the Desert, the Cave of the Sun-Dial and the Mills of God. Wolves, skeletal hands, sharks and octopuses must be dealt with.</description>
