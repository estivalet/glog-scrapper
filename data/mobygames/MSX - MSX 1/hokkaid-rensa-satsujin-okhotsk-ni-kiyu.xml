        <description>In &lt;a href="/developer/sheet/view/developerId,50434/"&gt;Yuji Horii's&lt;/a&gt; follow-up to &lt;a href="/game/portopia-renzoku-satsujin-jiken"&gt;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&lt;/a&gt;, you once again play as a Tokyo police detective (whose name you assign) charged with solving a mysterious murder.  This time, your initial investigation of a dead body found floating in Tokyo Bay quickly leads you to follow the trail of clues to Hokkaido.  There, assisted by local police officer Shunsuke &amp;quot;Shun&amp;quot; Saruwatari, you will visit numerous popular real-life tourist attractions as you attempt to puzzle out the truth behind an ever-expanding series of murders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While maintaining the same first-person adventure format, this game drops the parser-driven interface used in earlier versions of the preceding title, instead introducing the menu system which was to become typical of Japanese adventure games.  The player selects from a number of simple commands (Go, Ask, Take, Show, Photograph, etc.) to find new evidence and advance the plot; also, the &amp;quot;Examine&amp;quot; command can (and sometimes must) be used to point at and examine specific spots in the scene pictured, so that the interface is not solely text-based.</description>
