        <description>The player controls a human that battles with enemy robots that pursue and attack in maze like constructed levels.
All you have to do is shoot all the robots and your off to the next level. Each level has different level exits on the north, south, east and west but some exits might be closed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Occasionally a bouncing smiley appears and you can not shoot it for bonus points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digitized speech is another feature of this game.</description>
