        <description>This is the first in &lt;a href="/search/quick?company=Bothtec"&gt; Bothtec's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=ginga+eiyuu"&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; of games based on the anime adaptation of &lt;a href="/search/quick?developer=Yoshiki+Tanaka"&gt;Yoshiki Tanaka&lt;/a&gt;'s science fiction novel cycle &lt;i&gt;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&lt;/i&gt;. The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von MÃ¼sel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around &amp;quot;historical&amp;quot; battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space. The player usually takes control of a &amp;quot;home planet&amp;quot;, which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map. Enemies typically appear after a few turns; depending on the goal, the player must prevent them from invading planets, destroy them, have his own ships invade a planet, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The space ships come in different flavors: high-speed battle ships, cruisers, supply ships, etc. Each ship has different mobility, attack range, weapons, defense parameters, etc. Actual combat is displayed on a separate screen and is automatic. The player usually has a choice to use different weapons (cannons, missiles, etc.) against the enemy ships.</description>
