        <description>&lt;i&gt;A Ressha de Ikou&lt;/i&gt; is the first in the long-running transport network simulation series mostly known as &lt;a href="/search/quick?gamegroup=A-Train"&gt; A-Train&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player controls a railroad company CEO in the end of the nineteenth century, who was entrusted by the president of an unnamed country to build a railroad that reaches its Western coast. The game is played in real time, with a day/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, &lt;i&gt;A Ressha de Ikou&lt;/i&gt; has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his/her competition against other networks.</description>
