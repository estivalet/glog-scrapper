        <description>Made in the old Japanese top-down style, Monster Hunter is a straight-forward RPG with a few original twists. You, as a knight, find yourself in a foreign land, and must find the king to be granted passage out of the kingdom. Thus, you find yourself on a typical console RPG quest to find one person, help him find an item, let him tell you where to find another person who can tell you where to find item X, and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outside of the major population centres are random encounters with monsters, which makes the game change to a battle screen. You can equip your character with new weapons and armours, and you have a range of magic spells available to you as well. Fighting is carried out in a peculiar manner, similar to certain golf games. You have a quickly rotating power bar, and pressing the button when it is at its highest makes your attack stronger.</description>
