        <description>The Serena Commander have the mission to rescue his companion of expedition captured in Moon 4 of System Sotpok, better known like the world Phantis, an unusual place inhabited by a hostile fauna and exuberant flora.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phantis is an horizontal shooter (&lt;a href="/search/quick?game=R-Type"&gt;R-Type&lt;/a&gt; like), combined with platform arcade levels (&lt;a href="/game/turrican"&gt;Turrican&lt;/a&gt; like). You have 24 different enemies to beat throughout 4 phases and 6 levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This program has two parts, recorded individually on cassette versions. In order to play the second, it's necessary to discover the access code, which is granted when finishing the first.That procedure was called FX Doble Carga (FX Double Charge), and designed to give more hours of addictive playing.</description>
