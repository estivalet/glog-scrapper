        <description>&lt;i&gt;Pink Sox 8&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. This volume contains an episode in the mini-adventure &lt;i&gt;G Gun-Cannon&lt;/i&gt; which began in the &lt;a href="/game/pink-sox-7"&gt;previous installment&lt;/a&gt; and features the recurrent protagonist Sayaka as she is being molested by a gang of genetically mutated students. The non-interactive story &lt;i&gt;Halftime Lover&lt;/i&gt; is concluded in this volume as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only other mini-game in this installment is entitled &lt;i&gt;Sim Girl&lt;/i&gt;. Rather than being a true simulation game, however, it is a simple arcade-style game where the player moves a paddle left and right, trying to connect with falling objects such as rocks, chunks of meat, Y chromosomes, etc. Depending on the type and the amount of objects caught the player is treated to view a picture of the creature that has evolved as a result.</description>
