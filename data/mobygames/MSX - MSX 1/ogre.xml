        <description>&lt;i&gt;Ogre&lt;/i&gt; is a 2D turn-based strategy game, and a direct computer conversion of Steve Jackson's board game of supertanks going against conventional infantry with howitzers. It plays exactly like the board game - on a hex-based board one player controls ordinary military units (soldiers, tanks etc.), and defends against the second player, who controls a supertank named &amp;quot;Ogre&amp;quot; - Ogre is very powerful, and can easily destroy normal weaponry and ground forces.</description>
