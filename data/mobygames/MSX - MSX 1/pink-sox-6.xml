        <description>&lt;i&gt;Pink Sox 6&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the conclusion of the sci-fi adventure &lt;i&gt;Who Is There&lt;/i&gt; from the previous games, as well as a new chapter in the &lt;i&gt;Balancing Beam of Love&lt;/i&gt;, introducing a new heroine in a superhero comic book-like setting. There are two new mini-games: the first, entitled &lt;i&gt;PC City&lt;/i&gt;, consists of a floating island and a few scenes (mostly involving young women) that occur when the player accesses various locations on it (such as a ship, an observatory, a medieval castle, etc.). The second mini-game is sub-titled &lt;i&gt;Let's Zazen&lt;/i&gt; and depicts a comical Zen lesson as the player switches between pupils trying to avoid the master's blows.</description>
