Like many other manufacturers, Triumph-Adler tried to conceive hybrid systems using 8-bit AND 16-bit CPUs, so that 8-bit systems owners could still use their 8-bit sotfware when buying their new systems...

Unfortunately, the Triumph-Adler solution is not very enthusiastic. The P-30 and the P-40 use the same case and keyboard as the P-3 and P-4. In fact they can be considered has P-3 and P-4 systems with an additional 8088 CPU card, for 16-bit enhancement.

The difference between the P-30 and the P-40 is that the P-30 has two 5''1/4 disk-drives (875kb each), and the P-40 has one floppy and one 12Mb hard-disk.
