With the Quattro, ICL attempted to tackle the multi-user market which was still opened with neither definitive system nor operating system.
The Quattro was a development of earlier ICL Personal Computer which in turn was a development of the Rair Black Box
The machine was named Quattro as it supported up to four users, each user running up to four programs simultaneously.
Internal hardware design was quite similar as the Personal Computer's. An eight connector backplane supporting logic boards. However, the CPU board featured a 16 bit 8086-2 and up to 1 MB of RAM could be installed.
Thre models were available:
Model 19 with 256 KB RAM and 2 x 5&amp;quot; 800 KB floppy drive,
Model 39 with 512 KB of RAM, one floppy drive and one 10 MB hard disk,
Model 49 same as Model 39 but with a 20 MB hard disk.
The Quattro could work with wirtually any video terminal. ICL supplied its own monochrome (6402G) and colour (6404G) graphic versions along with a 102 key keyboard.
It was delivered with Concurrent CP/M Operating System, later called Concurrent DOS, a true multi-tasking, multi-user O.S. which offered a very limited compatibility with MS-DOS.
Sadly, few major software of the time, running on the first IBM PC and clones, were adapted to the specific features of the ICL. This is the main reason why the Quattro didn't meet any success, except near some corporate customers who already used ICL mainframes.
