In 1991, Psion launched their first clamshell format organiser, the
Series 3.  It featured a NEC V30H 8086-compatible processor running at
3.84MHz.  The machine featured 128K or 256K of RAM, and into its 384K
ROM Psion fit their EPOC operating system (as used in the MC 200 &amp;amp; 400
models, upgraded with new features), several good office/PDA
applications and the OPL programming language.

In 1993 the Series 3a was launched.  Despite the insignificant change
in version number, this was a major upgrade: 256K or 512K RAM, double
the processor speed, a much bigger LCD screen and upgraded sound
capable of playing back digital samples at 8-bit or 13-bit quality.
The 1MB ROM included new applications: a spreadsheet and a much
upgraded Agenda package comparable to agenda/diary applications on
desktop machines.  1MB and 2MB models were added later, and included a
Patience game.

The Series 3 range of computers continued to be developed until 1998,
when the model 3mx was released.  This model was discontinued in 1999.
Much of their software was ported to the Series 5 range, which was
produced between 1997 and 2001, and some of the software, especially
the built-in programming language OPL, is still being used and
developed in Symbian mobile phones (Series 60, etc.), which are the
descendants of the Psion PDA software architecture.
