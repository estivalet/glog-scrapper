 SIL'Z systems from the same company seem to be an evolution of the Silex. SIL'Z systems had some success, particularly in french administrations and schools. 

According to somone who worked at the plant (Haubourdin city in France) the Sil''z was an Apple 2 machine with some enhancements (graphics) in a hard case (aluminium), and with a better power supply, built in video CRT and strong keyboard. It was possible to connect 8&amp;quot; and 5.25&amp;quot; drives.

The floppy disk unit can store 320 KB for the model 5 and 640 KB for the model 6.

Several devices were developped for this computer : video card (512 x 256), secondary RS232, IEEE488 or battery.
