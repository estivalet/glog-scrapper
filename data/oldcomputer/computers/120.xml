We don't know much about this strange French computer. It was designed by Patrick Jossier, an award winning French designer, to be used as a word processing computer and only few were sold.

This computer was dedicated to word processing (with a 80*25 text resolution), had a 'hidden' CP/M OS launching the text processor at start. Main CPU was Z80/4MHz, the other Z80 was dedicated to keyboard/display, almost like an 'integrated terminal'.

This computer was 100% french made, from hardware to software (except for the OS).

The system pictured here is Logystem Ecritext 2
