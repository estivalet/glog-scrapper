The AT&amp;amp;T UnixPC was AT&amp;amp;T's attempt to get into the business computer market of the mid-1980s. There were two flavors of this machine: the 7300, and the 3B1. Basically the circuitry is identical in both machines however the 3B1 allowed more room for hard-drive storage, as shown with the ominous bulge underneath the screen. (not shown in model above).

The windowing manager was absolutely wonderful keeping the UNIX system well hidden, however, you could naturally open a shell and interface directly. The graphics system was neat as well - there is a 3D bitmap demo online somewhere. 

These computers could support 3 terminals with an add-on card for concurrent use by up to 4 users (one at he console, one on the built-in port, and one each on the two add-on ports).

The keyboard could be &amp;quot;nested&amp;quot; on the shelf in front of the floppy drive. The sound was limited to beeps. 

There was also an add-on board with a speech synthesizer which could turn the UnixPC into a full-fleged voicemail management system.

An absolutely wonderful and advanced computer for it's time, which can still teach modern computers a lesson in innovation.
