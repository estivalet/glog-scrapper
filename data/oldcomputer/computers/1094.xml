Extremely rare french portable computer!

Sobrelec was based in Bretagne, near Brest (France). It was founded by Marcel Richard, former Thomson engineer, in 1974. They used to produce goods for Thomson or Marine Nationale (french Navy). They also produced the LX-500 and LX-525 computers for Logabax.

At the Sicob 1982 exhibition they presented their first own computer : the Totus. It is luggable system, quite similar to the Osborn 1, with a bigger screen though, and two 370 KB 5.25'' built-in disk drives.

Apparently it was mainly used by accountants in Bretagne, while moving from farms to farms.
