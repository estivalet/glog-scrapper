This Word Processor was originally produced by Syntrex Inc. Eatontown, New Jersey and sold under the brand of Olivetti. This was in 1980 (Version 1 of Syntrex Operating System was not sold); in 1981 the completely redesigned Version was sold with the system worldwide. 

The picture shows the base unit of the ETS 1010 (Electronic Typing System) It came with a display unit and one could attach an electronic typewriter (usually an ET121 or ET221) or a keyboard.

The cabinet socket plugged into a central storage device which could support 8 or 16 ETS units at a time plus 2 printers. There was a 10 MB hard drive option (later 20 MB Winchester HDD) which was the size of a chest freezer.

A variety of daisy wheel printers could be used with the system: PR430 / DY310 / DY450 / ET121 / ET221

There also existed an ETS2010 which was an updated version. It used an 80186 CPU, had more memory and was compabitable with all data on ETS1010.
