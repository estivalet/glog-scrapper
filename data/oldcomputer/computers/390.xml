        <description>
The motherboard accommodates up to four memory boards, each with 16 K 16 bit words of programmable memory, four IO cards, and an optional front panel card. A parallel IO card includes two 16-bit input and two output ports as well as EPROM sockets for IO device handler sofware.

System software includes 8K macroassembler, linker and relocate loader, an editor and a debugger.

The M16 provides a 8K PACE BASIC which features IO and memory access, wait for input or timer.

And, last but not least, it is enclosed in a gun stock walnut veneer cabinet (insert oohs &amp;amp; ahs here).

Chad Castagana adds:
Back in 1986 Micromega came out with a Home Robot called Hernie, similar in utility to the Hero Jr from Tandy.
The personal robot looked like a black 'Darth Vader' helmet on wheels, low to the ground. Its 'eyes' where ultrasonic transducers for a sonar locater/ranging system, it also had a musical tone generator and a voice synthesizer. It's programming language was a variant of BASIC specially written for it and called Mother Ernie.
