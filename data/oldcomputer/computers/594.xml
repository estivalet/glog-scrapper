The S-100 Bus was an universal standard for computer cards. It was adopted by dozens manufacturers between 1975 and 1983.

To differentiate themselves from other competitors, each manufacturer tried to add an original idea in their new machines. For the QPD-100, it was a start-up menu displayed when the machine was turned on, which allowed users to easily modify operating system parameters or run various utilities and applications. 
Apart from this menu, the system was a standard S-100 based computer with a 4-6 Mhz Z80 microprocessor card. It was sold with one or two 8&amp;quot; floppy drives and an optional 10 MB hard disk running under a CP/M or MP/M operating system.

This first version was followed by the QDP-200 and QDP-300 series but we have little information about them at the moment.
