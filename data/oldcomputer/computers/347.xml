Software for this system includes the debugger (in ROM), a BASIC interpreter, a FORTRAN compiler and a linker. The ROM debugger features interactive translation of assembly language mnemonics, tape, disk and printer commands and multiple breakpoints.

The system was available in two configurations : the DEC68 DT (pictured above) which includes a FDD, and the DEC68 C which fits into a smaller case without the FDD. It was priced from $2000.
