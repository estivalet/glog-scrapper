This first Alphatronic computer by the german company Triumph-Adler is targeted for the business and education. The main software applications were for management, billing, wordprocessing (TRENDTEXT), calculation, etc...

The Alphatronic uses the MOS (Micro Operating System) operating system.

There were in fact two models available: P1 and P2. The Alphatronic PC/P1 had one floppy drive, and the PC/P2 had two. The picture beside seems to be a PC/P2.

There was SKS/BASIC on Disc, startable by MOS directly. It was a pure Microsoft BASIC, comparable to GW-BASIC without Graphics. 

There was a modified version of CP/M 2.2 for this machine, and for this you could get BASIC 80 and the Siemens Macro ASSEMBLER.

The native double disk-drives (160 KB each) could be replaced by higher capacity ones (785 KB each). A hard-disk (5 MB) was also available, as well as a memory expansion (64 KB).
