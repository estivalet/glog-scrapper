IBM was struggling in 1986 against Apple's Macintosh series, so IBM set out to create something that would defeat the Macintosh. IBM came up with a all-in-one similar to the Macintosh. However, the Model 25 &amp;amp; 30 were the low-end (budget) models of the PS/2 range.

The PS/2 Model 25 became quite popular with businesses, but never made it strong with the home market.

The PS/2 Model 25 &amp;amp; 30 were the only system using the MCGA (Multicolor Graphics Adapter) standard. They came with this video features built-in. MCGA offered all text and graphic modes of the CGA standard plus 640x480 monochrome and 320x200, 256 colors (out of a palette of 262,144). It announced the future VGA standard which will become much more popular.

Model 25 &amp;amp; 30 were also the only PS/2 systems using an 8-bit ISA bus (like PC ATs), as opposed to other PS/2 models which used a 16 or 32 bit MCA bus.

Further information from Brandon:
The model 25 came in two models, a monochrome model, and a color model.  The monochrome model usually is called &amp;quot;Type 001&amp;quot;, the color one being &amp;quot;Type 004&amp;quot;..  There never was a type 002, or 003.
The motherboard for the color and black and white models are exactly the same, minus some revisions on the later years.  They were always surface mounted though (most of the chips anyway).
They are a tough machine, though when you install one in a new room, it NEEDS to let sit in the room for a couple hours, otherwise the power supply/motherboard will die.
While the floppy drives were 720KB, they &amp;quot;could&amp;quot; use 1.44MB drives, as long as the interface was the same.
They contain TWO BIOS's in them.  One called the CBIOS, and the other called the ABIOS.. CBIOS is &amp;quot;Compatible BIOS&amp;quot;, and is used for DOS or Windows 3.0 and under...  ABIOS, or &amp;quot;Advanced BIOS&amp;quot;, is used when it runs OS/2..  OS/2 is the native OS to this unit. They also had an option for a hard drive.
