The Rockwell AIM 65/40 was an evolution of the AIM 65 mainly intended for industrial and scientific applications.

Its four modules included an 6502-based single board computer, a dot matrix printer with 40-column alphanumerics and graphic capabilities, a 40-char. alphanumeric display and a full ASCII keyboard.

The AIM 65/40 could be purchased as a complete system for end users or as separate modules for OEM users. The printer and display modules could be mounted remotely from the mainboard.
