The HP Integral PC is a &amp;quot;portable&amp;quot; computer (luggable, more like it, since it weights more than 10 Kg) which works under HP-UX (Hewlett Packard UNIX variant).

It has a plasma screen and a built-in printer (the world famous HP ThinkJet, 150 cps).

The memory can be extended to 1.5 Mb with 256 Kb modules and up to 5.5 Mb with an external extension.

The ROM contains the OS (HP-UX), HP windows (the GUI) and PAM (a kind of graphic shell).

This computer had no great success since it was very expensive and only few business applications were adapted to it.
