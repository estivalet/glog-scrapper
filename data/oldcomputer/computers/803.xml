The SPC-1000 is a Z80-based home computer from Samsung. This machine was developed in Korea, but built-in BASIC was written by Hudson soft in Japan.

Because of its integrated tape recorder design, it looks like MZ 700 series.

It has a button 'ILP' on its left side. Pushing ILP button enables this machine to load a new O/S from tape recorder. (This concept resembles MZ 700, too).

This machine was quite popular at the first time, but advent of MSX and MSX2 pushed this machine off the market.

CP/M was available with double-side, double density floppy disk drives. But the cost of the FDD unit and poor display capability limited its use.

Part of early productions were delivered under the name of SPC-1100.

Thanks to Kue-Hwan Sihn from Korea for info and picture.
