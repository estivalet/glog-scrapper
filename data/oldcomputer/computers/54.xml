Iskra DELTA 800 was derived from the Digital PDP-11/34, compatible to the DELTA family. It could be connected to other computer systems like DEC, IBM, UNIVAC, and others.

It had extended addressing capability (hence, could support 4 MB of RAM), was running somewhat modified RSX 11M, called Delta M OS, and ran J11 Digital Equipment processor (as all PDPs 11 did).

There were several programming languages written for its operating system: ASSEMBLER, COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC and PASCAL. Iskra Delta was one of the biggest producers of computer systems in former Yugoslavia. Their systems could be found in almost all large companies in Yugoslavia.

More info needed!
Thanks to Delimir Purgar and Bostjan Lemut for some info.
