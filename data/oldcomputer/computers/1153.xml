After NeXT abandoned the hardware business,Canon (who had a large investment in NeXT) bought the licence and started producing the successor to the NeXTstation. 

The Object Station was an Intel-based PC specifically adapted to run the NEXTSTEP O/S. There were two versions available, the 31 and the 41, with IDE &amp;amp; SCSI being the main difference. There are also specs for a Pentium-based 51 but it remains unclear whether it actually came to market. 

The computer could also run Windows and other PC operating systems.
It came with a keyboard, that had the NeXT-specific keys found on NeXT keyboards and accompanied by a 17&amp;quot; or 21&amp;quot; monitor (made by Hitachi). NEXTSTEP 3.3 O/S was pre-installed. 

The Object Station did not sell very well (possibly due to marketing and Canon having other plans than being a PC manufacturer) and thus was very short lived, making it a very hard to find item.
