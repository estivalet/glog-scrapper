This Bulgarian computer was an IBM PC compatible system. It was one of the most powerful computer available at that time in Bulgaria. It was developed by a team of computer engineers ran by professor Angel Angelov.  

The latest models were powered with a NEC microprocessor (at approx. 12 Mhz). They had a Bulgarian BIOS and DOS.

The following software was available:
-programing languages (BASIC-16, PASCAL, Cobol,Ada);
-dBASE systems (Micro-PC-2);
-Text editors (Text-16, MicroTEXT-16, DOKS-2);
-Electronic schedules (Superplan-16, MicroPLAN/16);
-information-searching systems (INFOS);
-Administration automatisation (MIS);
-Integrated products (MULTIPACK);
-Machine graphics;
-CAD (GraphCAD, PLOT-1);
-communication utilities;
-learning&amp;amp;enjoy programs;
-specialised products.

Bogomil Alexandrov reports:
Pravetz 16 was part of the MIK-16 family of computers, which included:
- Pravetz 16 (the one on the picture, 4.77Mhz)
- Pravetz 16A (1x Floppy, 1x 5MB HDD)
- Pravetz 16H (improved one, 8Mhz, 1 or 2 Half size floppies + 1x HDD 20MB - half size)
- Pravetz-286
The first version of Pravetz 16 had a built-in Basic on a ROM chip, which loaded if no OS was present. The 16A did not have a built-in Basic.

Todor Kirilov adds:
I used to work on a Pravetz 16H model. Extremely stable, but has some problems with cooling, so i had to open the cover while working. The 20-Mg HDD was a revolution, for almost 4 years the HDD never show any errors. There was a CGA built-in control, and i had a 16-color display. This machine was excellent for making DOS-programing, and was used till the middle of the 90's, mostly in government facilities.
