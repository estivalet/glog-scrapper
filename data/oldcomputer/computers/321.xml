The successor of the JR 200. Almost everything was changed, the computer has two CPUs to keep the compatibility with the previous models (JR-200). This machine has also a superimposition feature.

In fact it seems to be a mix between a JR-200 and a Sharp X1 system... quite strange ! But apparently this model was never really marketed.

A handheld model called JR 800 was launched few time later, but it was not compatible with the previous JR computers.
