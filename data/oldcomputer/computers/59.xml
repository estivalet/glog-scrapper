The Alcyane had a very powerful basic for files managing called Alcybase. It could use a specific version of APL. It was possible to network 2 to 4 computers together.
The manufacturer was MATRA DATASYSTEM (until 1986)
These computers where mainly sold with 10 MB removable 12&amp;quot; hard disks from CII Honneywell Bull.
A multi-user system was also released, called A10.

Jean Pierre Bouhot was one of the founders of MBC. The C letter came from COTTIN who went into partnership with Bouhot.
Initial planned company name was MBI, anagram of IBM with the slogan &amp;quot;L'informatique &amp;agrave; l'envers&amp;quot; (computing backwards).
Bouhot also created the French magazine &amp;quot;L'informatique professionnelle&amp;quot; which is still alive and is now property of Gartner Group through his 1997 aquisition of &amp;quot;Bouhot &amp;amp; Le Gendre&amp;quot; consulting French Cie.
