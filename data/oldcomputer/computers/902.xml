The MBC-1100 and MBC-1150 were two 8-bit machines intended for business market. They replaced the old MBC-1000. 

There was no difference between the 1100 and 1150 models except that they left the factory with 1 or 2 drives installed. It was often done that a 1100 model would have a drive added by the dealer, as it was sometimes less expensive to add the Teac 5.25&amp;quot; disk drive than buy the 1150, or often the 1100s were more available in stock.

Both models had no graphic features. This was introduced with the follow-up MBC-1200 and 1250 models.
