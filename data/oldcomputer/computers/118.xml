Very little is known about this system. Help largely welcomed !

It is of course a business oriented computer. It looks like it is an all-in-one system with the keyboard, the display and the motherboard built-in the same plastic case. Or maybe the keyboard is separated, it is not clear looking at the only picture we have so far. The double external 5.25'' disk-drive seems huge...

An 8&amp;quot; disk unit (1 MB) and hard disk (5, 10 or 20 MB) were also available for this system.
