Peerless was a company that was started by some of the former employees
of AM International - Jacquard.

Peerless built a computer and 4 terminal control boards that would run Jacquard's OS. The computer was compact very much like the pc towers that we have now.

This very good system ran all the software that were written for the Jacquard, but it was very pricey, 20-30 thousand dollars just for the base unit...

That was about the time IBM PC came out , the PC doomed the Peerless and the Jacquard systems. Peerless did come out with a board that allowed a PC to run as a Peerless Jacquard terminal over Arcnet
network.

NASA bought a lot of these peerless systems to replace the numerous Jacquard systems that they had, mainly for word processing.

The peerless was a good replacement for the Jacquard system but by the time it was coming out when the market was moving to the IBM PC.

Thanks to Randy Larson for information and pictures.
