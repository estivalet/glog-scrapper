It uses the standard ''S100'' bus supported by over a dozen manufacturers. And all Cromemco peripherals (PROM memory and programmer, Ram memory, analog I/O, color TV interface, etc) just plug into the Z1's sockets...&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; ... The Z-1 comes completely assembled ans tested. It's a quality, commercial grade microcomputer. It is not available as a kit.&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

The Cromemco Z-1 uses an IMSAI chassis, with 22 card slots and a 28 amperes (about 300 watts) power supply. The major innovation of the Z-1 is the use of the 4 Mhz version of the Z-80 processor. It is also equiped with its own 2708 type EPROM burner card.

Like the IMSAI, the Basic version of the Cromemco Z-1 is programmed through the front panel switches, and results are read from the front panel leds... Hopefuly, it is possible to connect a standard Video terminal through the serial port.
