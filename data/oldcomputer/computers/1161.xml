The TK-2000 was a clone of the Apple IIc for its Electronics part; and a copy of the Atari 1200XL for the casing part.

For copyright reasons, Microdigital preferred to say that it was compatible with the Multitech MPF-II, an obscure Taiwanese computer which was somewhat compatible with the Apple II; but also added in its brochure that &amp;quot;a major part of Apple DOS software is compatible with the TK-2000&amp;quot; :-)

On top of Apple II features, the TK-2000 offered 64 KB of RAM, a sound generator, a PAL/M TV/RF modulator, a parallel printer connector and the ability to connect simulteneously two tape recorders. On the other hand, there were no expansion slots; which resulted in compatibility problems with Apple software that used original Apple hardware I/O.
