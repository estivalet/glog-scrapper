Hitachi, along with Sharp and Canon, were among the Japanese video manufacturers who have decided to diversify into computers. They brought with them a strong reputation for reliability and value for money.

The Hitachi MB-16000 was one of the first Japanese IBM PC compatibles.It was certainly well equipped and was able to compete at the highest level of PC and compatible systems of the time. It came complete with a colour monitor.

One of its interesting characteristics was its &amp;quot;enhanced&amp;quot; graphic mode: it was primary designed to be a CAD computer. A colour and monochrome version existed.

It ran MS-DOS. It was possible to connect an optional 10 Mb hard disk and a 256 Kb RAMdisk card was designed especially for this computer.
