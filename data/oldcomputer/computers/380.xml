The FM-11 AD2 is an evolution of the FM-11 AD. It is delivered with the OS-9 operating system.

There was also a FM-11 AD2+ model with enhanced features like 256 KB RAM instead of 128 KB.

Torsten Dittel, from Germany, adds:
Looks like the FM11 AD2 had an HD63C09EP from Hitachi installed. It was a
PIN/Code compatible CMOS/3MHz version of the MC68B09E from Motorola. For licensing reasons Hitachi kept as a &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; that it has a special
native mode with additional instructions/registers/capabilities and more
speed. I don't think these features were used in the stock OS-9 Level II
installed.
With our CoCo3s and the CPU changed to an HD63C09EP we use a
special OS-9 version called NitrOS9 to take advantage of this native
mode.

Gern, from Japan, reports:
I've owned FM-11AD2, used for 3 years. Here I wanna introduce unique aspect of this wonderful machine.
One of the interesting feature of FM-11 series is CPU cards. All FM-11 without BS model equipped a couple of CPU slots and one is filled with 6809. Z80 and 8088 CPU card was available from FUJITSU. 68000 card was available from third party. CP/M-80/86 was available for each CPU cards. (But everytime system boots from 6809 ;-)
FM-11BS might be only model come with 8088.
After ST/AD/EX line-up, AD2 and BS replaced, then AD2+ followed. OS-9 was packaged with AD2/AD2+. AD2+ is supposed to be the longest one which FUJITSU manufactured because amazing multitask was appropriate for many  industrial devices. When I was noticed from final lots of FM-11AD2+ from FUJITSU, over 2 following generation FM series were extinct.
