Very unusual clone and first repackaging of the Atari Mega ST computer.
Apparently the manufacturer bought the parts from Atari and repackaged it as a series of rugged modules in a 19&amp;quot; rack mount case so the computer was better suited to music and industrial applications.
This seems like a good idea seeing how popular the Atari was in studios.

Information discovered in some German Atari magazine around 1989.
It is not known how successful this computer was or if they went on to make any other systems

Picture and more information needed.
There are rumours there were other clones of the Atari ST series in the early part of its life.

Thanks to Asteroid for this information.
