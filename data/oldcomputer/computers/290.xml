Here is the last MSX computer ever made. It is the successor of the MSX 2+ and thus has many characteristics in common. New features include: a new PCM sound chip which can produce digitized sound up to 44 KHz (in assembly language) and a new Z80 downward compatible R800 processor. The user can select the CPU (Z80 or R800) by software.

Panasonic was the only company to produce MSX 2 Turbo R systems: the FS A1. Two versions of the FS A1 were presented, the FS A1 ST and the FS A1 GT. The GT has 512 KB RAM, a MIDI interface and MSX View in ROM (MSX View is the Graphic User Interface compatible with MSX-DOS).

Panasonic stopped the production of the Turbo R when they launched the 3DO game system in 1992. They failed with this system and never returned to MSX.
Lot of extensions, however, were produced by third-party companies to enhance the Turbo R, among them, an OPL4 Sound Card, a hi-res card (Yamaha V9990) with lot of hardware sprites and IDE or SCSI interfaces.

David Heremans reports:
There is a mixed mode where you can have +4096 colors
simultaneously with an extra 16 indexed colors so that still pictures in
full color can be displayed while the index palatte of 16 redefinable colors
can be used for all kind of effects. But trying to display that would
probably be a litle long for the small space reserved for it on the
page.
