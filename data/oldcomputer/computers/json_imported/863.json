  "description": "\nThe Husky Hawk has inherited the very solid case of the  Hunter. The screen was well protected with a thick layer of plastic and all the ports had protective coverings. However, it was not designed to take the rough treatment that the Husky could endure. For example, it could not being used in the rain.\n\nThe chicklet keyboard featured a numeric and arrow key keypad. However, Husky could produce \u0027cut down\u0027 versions dedicated to particular applications.\n\nSeveral peripheral could be connected to the Hawk.\nThe Sidebox was designed to be used on the move and was powered by Hawk\u0027s internal batteries. It was firmly locked to the Bus expansion and accepted a portable 1200 baud modem, an analogue to digital converter, RAM and ROM disk expansions and a Parallel interface.\nThe \u0027Homebase\u0027 expansion required a mains supply and automatically connected the Hawk to a 2400 baud modem and charger whenever it was placed on it. \nA 3.5\u0026quot; disc drive unit called Oracle (made in Japan by Brother) and a bar-code reader also could be connected to the mini-DIN serial port.\n\nThe DEMOS operating system (for Disk EMulation Operating System) was a very compatible extended version of CP/M 2.2. All standard CP/M software - WordStar, CalcStar, Mbasic... - ran without problems. To overcome standard CP/M 80 column screen output, Husky used a  40 X 8 virtual window on a full size 80 x 25 screen. \n\nFor custom application writers, Husky also provided a special version of Locomotive BASIC, a superset of Microsoft BASIC, also well known of Amstrad users. This version took advantage of the special facilities of the Hawk: graphics handling, both serial and infra-red ports, bar-code reader and file management using physical or virtual RAM and ROM disks.\n\n \n\n\n",
