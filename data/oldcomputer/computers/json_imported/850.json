  "description": "\nThe BBC Master was an enhanced version of the BBC Model B providing improved features, but sadly also introducing compatibility problems with earlier BBC systems. \n\nThese features were: loads more memory such as shadow, sideways and private RAM, 4 sound channels, twin cartridge sockets, as well as several built-in ROM software packages like View (word processor), ViewSheet (spreadsheet), ADFS (Advanced Filing System), a text editor and terminal utilities.\n \nLike the Model B, the system had so many I/O ports that most of them had to be placed under the case. Luckily, they only used flat-cable connectors. \n\nWhen it was released, the BBC Master met with great success. From 1986 to 1989, about 200,000 systems were sold, mainly to U.K. schools and universities. \nSeveral enhanced versions of the Master were launched in the following months:\n- The Master 512 was a Master 128 with 512 KB of RAM and an internal 80186 processor. It could be upgraded up to 1024 KB and ran MS-DOS.\n- The Master Turbo was a Master 128 with a 65C02 as a second processor.\n\nThe BBC Master and Master Compact could be considered the most accomplished 8-bit \u0027home\u0027 computers and among the last mass-produced 8-bit machines. Production ended in 1993. \nWhile developing and marketing the BBC Master, Acorn realized the PC world was moving on from 8-bit to 16-bit processors and started developing their own 32-bit chip, the Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM.\n \n\n\n",

It was designed with both eyes fixed firmly on the future. So that whatever shape the future takes, we\u0027ll be able to fit it into the system. Just as simply as the peripherals and software already available fit into the system. That way, the system will grow with you. And you\u0027ll never get left behind. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Based around the Z80A microprocessor, and utilising Microsoft BASIC, Aquarius has 8K ROM and 4K RAM resident within its console. It is able to provide up to 16 colours and resolution of 320 x 192, and generates its sound directly through the television\u0027s speakers. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; With twin cartridge ports, the mini-expander allows simultaneous use of additional RAM and software cartrldges. Twin disc game hand controls are included and the unit provides two additional sound channels. The 16K RAM cartridge plugs into either the console or the mini-expander, increasing Aquarius\u0027s RAM capacity to 20K. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; With the ability to reproduce the entire graphic and character set of Aquarius at 80 characters a second, the printer\u0027s 40 column output allows transcription of the complete monitor image. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Using standard audio cassettes, the data recorder provides storage for programs and information, and allows the use of cassette based software. Incorporating a digital tape counter and transmission indicator, it operates sequential searching. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; A large number of games, designed to take advantage of Aquarius\u0027s sophisticated colour and sound capabilities, are available on cartridges that plug into the console either direct, or through the mini-expander. Cassette based games can be used via the data recorder. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; A wide range of preprogrammed cartridges is available, including the LOGO teaching program and practical home data systems like FILEFORM and the spreadsheet calculator package FINFORM. \u0026lt;/font\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
