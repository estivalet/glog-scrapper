  "description": "\nAfter the MPF-1 educational systems, Multitech (which eventually became Acer in 1987) conceived the MPF-II computer (MPF stands for Micro-ProFessor) a more advanced computer supposed to be compatible with the Apple 2.\n\nThe MPF-II must be the only computer delivered with two keyboards! The first one is located directly onto the system case. It has very small calculator type keys and is really painful to work with. In fact it is the same used with MPF-1 Plus and MPF-1/65 educational computers. Knowing that it wouldn\u0027t be enough for the more ambitious MPF-II, Multitech chosed to deliver a larger keyboard with rubber keys, same type used on popular computers of that time like the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Even though it was better than the first one, it wasn\u0027t still very convenient. There is even a special key labeled with the Multitech logo which function is... nothing. Indeed, nothing happen when you press it!\n\nThe main interest of the MPF-II is that it is supposed to be compatible Apple II. In fact only its Basic is compatible with the Applesoft Basic. Thus it is not possible to directly use Apple Software on a MPF-II, even though later, special ROMs modified by enthusiasts were available to turn the MPF-II into a full Apple II compatible system...\n\nSome extensions were available:\n- up to 2 disk drives with their controller (5.25\u0026quot;, Single Sided - Double Density, 250 KB non formated),\n- Multitech thermal printer using special thermal paper (10 cm wide). 150 lines per minute, 120 caracters per second,\n- Dot matrix printer\n- joysticks, tape recorder, multi-printer interface.\n\nSeveral optional software provided the MPF-II with Assembly, Pascal, Logo and Forth programming languages.\n\nWhen it came out in 1982, the MPF-II had excellent reviews since for a reasonable price you had color, high resolution and 64 KB RAM. This offer had nearly no competition... until the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 got more popular with their large software offer.\n\nThe MPF-1/65 also From Multitech is very similar to the MPF-II and might be based on it, or vice versa. The MPF-II had a successor, the MPF III, also partially compatible with the Apple IIe.\n\n_______________________\n\n",
