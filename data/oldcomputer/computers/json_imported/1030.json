  "description": "\nLittle is known about this system. Help welcomed !\n\nI.S.T.C. (Informatic Syst?mes T?l?Com) was a french company which was selling imported computers from USA, like the Apple II or the Compucolor. So it wouldn\u0027t be surprising if the ISTC 5000 was also an imported system. But which one ? We have not found the answer yet...\n\nIt is a big system with a built-in 10\u0027\u0027 amber display (80 x 25 characters) and one or two integrated 5.25\u0027\u0027 disk-drives (143 KB or 403 KB formated).\n\nFollowing software was available : Basic (delivered with the system), Macro Assembler, Extended Basic, Fortran IV ANSI, CP/M, Cobol, Pascal...\n\nA 5500 model was also released a bit later (1980), with slightly better features (disk drives capacity : 1 MB each)...\n \n\n\n",
