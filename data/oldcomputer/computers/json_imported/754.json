  "description": "\nThe Intellec Microcomputer Development Systems (MDS) were complete computers intended for the development of Intel microcomputer based products. They included a main unit with CPU, RAM, ROM, I/O and interrupt circuitry, as well as all necessary software: Assembler, linker, debugger.\n\nOptional EPROM programmer and In-Circuit Emulator (ICE) allowed real-time emulation and diagnostics into user configured system before saving final program into an EPROM.\n\nIntellec 4 and 8\nThe 4 was first Intellec Model, introduced in 1973. It was intended for software development for the 4004, first Intel 4-bit processor. We have few information about it, apart from an user memories:\nThis helped but it didn\u0027t really cut down that much on development time.\nLoading the assembler took *only* about 30 minutes. While for the program I was working on took almost an hour for each pass and the assembler was three passes (generate symbol table, punch machine code onto teletype paper tape punch, print assembler listing on teletype).\n\nThe same year, Intel also lauched the Intellec 8 for the 8008, first Intel 8-bit processor.\n\nIntellec MDS\n\nThe Intellec MDS was launched in (about) 1975. It featured an 8080 processor and could implement MCS-80 (8080) based computers and Intel Series 3000 systems.\n\nThe main unit needed a Serial video terminal or an ASR-33 Teletype to be connected, as well as a paper tape puncher/reader and/or floppy drive unit.\n\nSiemens sold in Germany a local version  of the first Intellec called SME-800.\n\nSeries II\n\nThe Intellec series II Model 230 included  a 2000 character CRT, a detachable full ASCII keyboard and dual double-density 8\u0026quot; diskette drives providing over 1 MB of data storage.\n\nISIS-II Diskette Operating Software allowed the Model 230 to be used for assembly and/or compilation and debugging of programs for Intel\u0027s MSC-80 (8080), MCS-85 (8085) or MCS-48 (8048) microprocessor families. ISIS also supported FORTRAN and PL/M languages. \n\nFor further information, you can refer to the Siemens SME system which was the German version of the Intellec Series 2\n\nSeries III\n\nAs Intel\u0027s customers upgraded their designs from the 8085 to the 8086,\nIntel upgraded its \u0027Intellec\u0027 development system from Series-2 to Series-3\nby plugging in a new 16 bit board called \u0026quot;RPA-86\u0026quot; (Resident Processor\nAssembly) with 8086 CPU and 16 bit wide RAM and ROM.\n\nThe Series-3 boots up in 8 bit mode with the 8085 running under ISIS-2 like before, but when 16 bit software has to be executed, then the 8085 hands over the control to this new board which becomes bus master, and the rest of the Intellec MDS just serves as an I/O subsystem.\n\nThanks to Gottfried Silberhorn for information and pictures.\n_______________________",
