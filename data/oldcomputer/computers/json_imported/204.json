  "description": "\nThe Superbrain was an integrated system with keyboard, display and disc drives. The system used two Z80A microprocessors at 4 MHz, one for the main processing, and the other for peripheral activities.\n\nThe dual 5\u0026quot; floppy disc units could be 2x170 KB (single side), 2x340 KB (DS), and a 10 MB CompuStar hard disk could be added. \n\nThe SuperBrain was sold with the CP/M operating system, Microsoft Basic, an 8080 assembler and Microsoft Cobol 74.\n\nThe SuperBrain II appeared in 1982. It offered a faster and enhanced disk operating system, new video visual attributes and better graphics capabilities.\n_______________________",
