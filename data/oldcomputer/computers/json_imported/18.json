  "description": "\nThe model 3 is generally regarded as the successor to the Model 1. \nIts two 5.25\u0026quot; floppy disk drives could convert model 1 disks.\n\nInitially Radio Shack wanted to sell both the model 1 and 3 at the same time, but the FCC forced them to stop selling model 1. Is so they were discontinued because of the excessive radio noise that they put out.\n\nHowever, the Model 3 wasn\u0027t FULLY compatible with the model 1.  There were differences in ROM which meant some programs had to be converted, especially those machine language ones that made ROM calls.\n\n______________________\n\nModel III configurations, by Dave Thompson:\nTRS-80 Model III was sold in multiple configurations.\nNo hardrive configurations included:\nModel III with Level 1 ROM, 8k RAM sold for US$799.  Model III with Level 2 ROM, 16k RAM sold for $999.  \nThe first floppy drive cost $849, and could store 168k. The second drive was cheaper, and could store more. The price difference is due to the first one included the drive controller. The increased space on the second drive (189k) was due to the first drive must also contain some TRS-DOS (the operating system).\n\nBrandt Daniels adds:\n\nThere was also a TRS-80 VideoTex Computer terminal in 1980.\n\nMark Fowler reports:\nI worked for a company in 1982 that had integrated a 5MB, and later a 10MB hard disk into the TRS80 Model III.  It was then programmed in FORTRAN-66 as a dedicated medical records system, to mimic the pegbook accounting system in use in the 1980\u0027s. We introduced green phosphor, and later amber phosphor display tubes. Some systems were used with a modem to do simple email-type applications, and to access various bulletin boards.\n\n \n\n\n",
