  "description": "\nAll the MCM machines were designed and built in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The company was originally called \u0026quot;Micro Computer Machines, Inc.\u0026quot; (the term \u0026quot;micro computer\u0026quot; was all the rage in the early 70\u0027s) but sometime in the late 70\u0027s changed the name to simply \u0026quot;MCM Computers\u0026quot;.\n\nMCM was among the first companies to fully recognize and act upon microprocessor technology\u0027s immense potential for developing a new generation of cost-effective computing systems.\n\nTheir first machine was launched in 1974 as the \u0026quot;MCM/70\u0026quot;.  It was a small desktop microcomputer designed to provide the APL programming language environment for business, scientific, and educational use. Since personal computers were pretty much unheard of at the time and since the company didn\u0027t have much money the launch didn\u0027t get a lot of notice. It was re-launched in 1975 or 1976 as the \u0026quot;MCM/700\u0026quot; but this was purely a marketing game; the absolute sole difference between the 70 and the 700 was the additional zero on the model designation to the right of the plasma display.\n\nThe MCM 700 uses a full APL language interpreter and incorporates a battery backup system that automatically saves the user\u0027s workspace. It has an integrated plasma alphanumeric display, full 46 key input and a bus structure to allow interface to the other peripherals developed by MCM: Floppy Disk Drive, printer, plotter, card reader and a RS232 interface (called SCI 1200). At the time of release virtually the only external peripheral available (the plasma display and cassette tape drives were built in) was a Diablo daisy wheel printer. The additional peripherals were added over time.\n\nIn theory you could order models with zero, one or two cassette tape drives and with 2K, 4K or 8K of memory. In practice the 782 (8K, two drives) was the most common. There was no external operating system; when you pressed the ON button you went directly into the in-ROM APL which had all the facilities necessary to create programs and access all the peripherals, and allow virtual memory swapping on the two 100 KB built-in cassettes drives.\n\nThere were additional models released in due course:\n\n- Model 800 (faster cpu, RAM up to 16K, nicer looking case, CRT option)\n- Model 900 (faster again, RAM up to 24K, CRT built-in)\n- Model 1000, aka \u0026quot;MCM Power\u0026quot; (repackaged 900, with optional HDS-10 external hard disk unit)\n\n_______\n\nContributor: Cam Farnell who worked at MCM from 1973 until 1981, starting as a junior assembly language programmer and ending as the manager of research \u0026amp; development\n \n\n\n",
