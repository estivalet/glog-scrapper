  "description": "\nThis computer had a completely rubber keyboard a bit like the ZX-Spectrum. Basic statements and graphic symbols could be accessed via combinations of \u0026quot;function\u0026quot; keys such as CTRL, BASIC, FCTN and a special symbol key.\n\nThe BIT-90 could display 16 colors and 32 sprites, with a high-resolution of 256 x 192 pixels.\n\nLike its little brother the BIT-60, the BIT 90 could directly accept Colecovision cartridges, and Atari 2600 cartridges through a special interface. \nThe BIT-90 is also supposed to be a Sega SC-3000 clone with which it bears a striking resemblance.\n\nThe BIT-90, like the BIT-60 seems to have been available in different colored models, at least one white and one grey.\nSurely due to legal problems, this computer didn\u0027t last long.\n \n\n\n",
