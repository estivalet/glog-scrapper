  "description": "\nIn conceiving the Professional 300 series, DEC designers decided that new machines must be able to perform several tasks at once, apply the same user interface, communicate efficiently and use the same software as Digital\u0027s popular microcomputers.\n\nThese personal computers were really desktop-sized versions of the PDP-11, one of Digital\u0027s popular minicomputer. Both models shared the PDP-11 instruction set and memory management. Both had an operating system based on Digital\u0027s RSX-11M+. For the user, this meant that software applications developped for more than 500,000 PDP-11 and VAX systems were candidat for easy migration to a desktop personal computer.\n\nThe members of DEC 300 Pro series were the 325 (two 5.25\u0026quot; disk drives, 400 KB each, and 1 expansion slot), the 350 (one 5.25\u0026quot; disk drive, 10 MB hard disk and 5 expansion slots) and the 380.\nThe 325 and 350 used the F-11 CPU running at 13.33 MHz (the external clock actually ran at 26.66 MHz). The 380 used the J-11 CPU \n\nAbout the number of colours: the three planes gave 8 colors at one time by referencing an 8 entry palette.Each entry in the palette could be programmed for one of 256 colors (by setting RGB values).\n\nThe internal card cage had space for up to 6 options total, and the base 350 system with EBO used four. The base 380 system used two. A Z80 card was available and allowed to use CP/M as the OS.\n\nThe operating systems which ran on it were P/OS (which was a variation of RSX), RT-11 and a variation of Unix called Venix. P/OS and Venix are freely available nowadays. RT-11 is still licensed software and is still being developed and maintained.\n\nThese systems were originally sold as standalone units, but were later incorporated into the VAX 8000 series as the system ?Console?\n\nThanks to Megan Gentry, Former RT-11 Developer, who helped us \u0027debug\u0027 this page ;-)\n \n\n\n",
