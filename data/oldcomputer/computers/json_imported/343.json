  "description": "\nThe IMSAI VDP-80 was the first commercially succesful business computer, accounting for almost 50% of the store sales where I worked at the time.\n\nIt was delived with 48 KB or 64 KB of RAM, and newer systems offered the Persci 299, double-sided, double density floppy drives. Both models of Persci (277 or 299) were a dual drive with a shared voice coil positioner in the center.\n\nThe primary CP/M applications were Electric Pencil or Wordstar which made them a hit in law offices. FMS-80 (database), Supercalc (spreadsheet) and Accounting Plus were also used.\n\nSeveral languages were also available for this computer : BASIC (with compiler) and Fortran IV level 2 ANSI compiler.\n\nThese units were the first used by the Alexandria Police department to automate their booking and arrest database in 1978.\n_______________________",
