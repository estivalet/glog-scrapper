  "description": "\nIn 1989 Psion expanded their range, previously based around variants of \nan 8-bit handheld computer called the Organiser, into full size laptops. \nThe Organiser had proven to be very versatile within business, becoming \nthe standard tool of British Telecom, Marks \u0026amp; Spencer and many other \nbusinesses, with barcode readers, interfaces for printers and \nmeasurement devices, and robust construction with solid-state storage.\n\nThis reliance, and expertise, with solid-state storage led Psion to \ndevelop a 16-bit laptop range with no \u0027soft\u0027 storage options. The 80C86 \nbased devices introduced EPOC - still in development as an embedded OS \nand used in PDAs and computers like the Nokia 9210, Series 5 and Series \n7 - though now handled by Symbian.\n\nInitially consisting of 3 similar systems, the MC range started with the \nMC200 - a 256K system with a 640 x 200 screen taking up half the space \nin the clamshell style top half. Unlike Psion\u0027s later PDAs, the MC had \nvery conservative styling with the exception of the large touch-pad \nbelow the screen, and relied on good quality, especially for the \nkeyboard and screen. The MC400 expanded the screen to 640 x 400, \noffering a good size display compared to contemporary machines - many of \nwhich were pure DOS and didn\u0027t offer the GUI of the MC200 and 400.\n\nThe final version used the 3.84MHz 80C86 for the OS more commonly \nassociated with it - DOS 3.x. Psion\u0027s MC600, despite this apparently \nretrograde step, was seen as the flagship offering 640K RAM and \nadditional keys in place of the touchpad on the EPOC based systems. The \nrelatively high price of the system ensured it had little success in the \nfast moving PC compatible \u0027portable\u0027 market - however, the benefits \nPsion\u0027s past products offered still applied, and British Gas were \namongst the companies adopting the MC600 for on-site work.\n\nWhat did the MC range offer that marked them out from the existing \nlaptops on the market? Original plans were ambitious - Psion\u0027s other \nresearch included compressed audio, and a planed CODEC (COder/DECorder) \ncombined with an existing audio in/out bus was intended to offer \ndictaphone like capabilities. Interchangeable modules, mounted in the \nrear of the machine, would offer different interfaces (including the \nCODEC), and the successful (for Psion) SSD - Solid State Disk - was \ncatered for with 4 drives. The drives are compatible with the Series 3, \nthough little software exists for the MC. The lack of a backlight \ncombined with Psion\u0027s experience with portable electronics resulted in a \nremarkable battery life - around 70 hours on AA cells, and 20 with the \nrechargeable battery pack. The keyboard was excellent, high quality and \nfull-sized, and the built-in software included a basic Text editor, OPL \nprogramming language, and terminal emulation. They were capable of basic \nmulti-tasking, too. Interestingly, Psion\u0027s MC-link package was one of \nthe most remarkable methods of connecting to your PC or Macintosh - you \nhad access to the host machine\u0027s Filesystem on the MC, in fact it was \neasier to control transfers from the MC than the host!\n\nWhat they didn\u0027t offer was any sense of security. Within 2 years, Psion \nwere direct selling them with a new Word Processor, branded as the \nMC-Word. The MC200 was long gone, and the MC600 remained for corporate \nsales only. Windows-based laptops contributed to the failure of the MC \nrange, though none offered the immediacy and battery life, or light \nweight. A year later Psion would almost deny that the machines had \nexisted, the Series 3 leaving it\u0027s mark on the consumer market and \nproving Psion\u0027s competence beyond any doubt...\n\nThe MC\u0027s architecture did survive, in the form of the professional HC - \nHandheld Computer. This also spawned a ruggedised Series-3-alike, the \nWorkabout, which also saw the introduction of backlights on the Series 3 \n(the 3a) and future Psions. However, Psion didn\u0027t return to the \n\u0027notebook\u0027 market with any vigour;  the Series 7/netBook being a sadly \nlimited product that, whilst remarkably competent and efficient, lost \nthe lead to Microsoft\u0027s Windows CE platform, especially with CE Pro \nmachines like the Hewlett-Packard 820. It\u0027s another sad loss, as Psion \nmove out of hardware production and another British company threatens to \nfade from view - Psion Teklogix will continue to market products for \n\u0027commercial\u0027 use, but the Psion brand will disappear from consumer items \nin a year.\n\n______\n\n\nText \u0026amp; info from Richard Kilpatrick\n \n\n\n",
