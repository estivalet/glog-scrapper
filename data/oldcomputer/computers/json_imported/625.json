  "description": "\nMax-80 has been, along with the LNW-80, one of the two major Tandy TRS-80 Mod. III compatible computers.\n\nIt could run LDOS TRS-80 software three times faster. Nevertheless numerous internal differences made it incompatible as far as hardware was concerned: serial and parallel ports, disk interface and no tape connector.\n\nThe system also ran CP/M operating system. the early versions were\nshipped with 2.2 version, next ones with version 3. It could accept any 5\u0026quot; or 8\u0026quot; disk units of any capacity, including the new and rare (at that time) Sony 3.5\u0026quot; units.\n_______________________",
