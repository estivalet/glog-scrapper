  "description": "\nThe ITT 3030 is a modular system with several options available. The original CPU for example is a Z80A, but a 8086 CPU board was available...\n\nMore floppy disk drives and hard disks (5, 10 and 15 MB) can be added. The average access time of the hard-disks is 170ms, and the transfer rate 600 kb/s.\n\nIt is also possible to add up to two 8\u0026quot; disk drives in addition to the original 5\u0027\u00271/4 disk-drives. They can be simple-sides/simple-density (256k) and are thus compatible with the IBM 3740 format, or double-sided/double-density (1024kb).\n\nTwo monitors were proposed. A greenich monochrome one (80 x 24), and a color one being able to display 512 x 512 pixels and 16 colors. But these monitors could also be replaced with a TV.\n\nThe ITT 3030 works under CP/M, MP/M or BOS. It was delivered with CP/M and user documentations.\n\nThe following software were sold with the machine : CP/M, Microsoft Basic 5.0, Cobol, Fortran, Pascal (UCSB), Mailmerge and Supersport. Were also available : Calcstar, Wordstar, Datastar and many professional software (for doctors for example).\n\nThe ITT-3030 was in fact conceived by Standard Electric Lorenz, a subsidiary of ITT RFA.\n\nAbout BOS operating system, Ian Turner (from U.K.) clarifies:\n\nBos was an independent company who created a truly \u0027portable\u0027 (between different types of computers) operating system and sofware. They specialised in accounting packages but the OS was quite excellent and the name was the acronym of \u0026quot;Business Operating Software\u0026quot;. They were highly successful until the early 1990\u0027s when they were bought by an insurance company and slowly migrated into an accounts software company running under Unix.\nI was a major developer and reseller for them and was instrumental in the link between Bos and ITT, who offered Bos as a package with their systems. The company still exists.\n\nMore information from Thomas Bourke:\nBOS was originally developed by CAP Ltd who were *the* consulting company for IT in the 1970\u0027s - 80\u0027s - the eventually were taken over by a French Company with the resulting name of Cap Gemni Sogeti.\nAnyway, I digress, CAP didn\u0027t know what to do with BOS, so they effectively spun it of into a company called MPSL (Micro Process Software Ltd - if my memory serves).\nIt sold BOS and a bunch of horizontal packages (payroll, accounting, word processing, spreadsheet et al) both direct and through a series of dealers throughout the (english) speaking world.\nEventually MPSL (by now called BOS Software Ltd) was taken over by MISYS, a UK software/ services company. MISYS ran a VAN (value added network) for Insurance Brokers, hence the confusion with insurance companies - but they did and do other things as well - mainly for financial organisations (but hey, they\u0027re big, so they do lots of things!).\nAn MBO bought the remaining pieces in March 1999 and TIS Software Ltd now owns BOS...\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",
