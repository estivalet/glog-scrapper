  "description": "\nThe Sage IV was a no-compromise extended version of the Sage II.\n\nThere were 2 large PC boards in a SAGE IV.  The first had the CPU, 2 serial ports, PIO, GPIB, floppy controller, up to 512K DRAM.  This board was the same as the main board in the SAGE II.  The second board (which set above the first) had 4 more serial ports, hard disk controller, and another 512K DRAM.\n\nThe case was slightly taller as it contained the full height hard disk.\n\nThe built-in multi-user BIOS, written by Bill Bonham the Sage software guru, allowed the Sage to run several operating systems at once, serving up to 6 serial ports in real time within 1 MB of RAM... in 1983. At this time, PC/Intel based systems used a 8 bit-bus processor running twice slower, and a primitive operating system. So why this Sage system didn\u0027t become the standard of the future? \n\nIn addition to the P-System delivered with the system, several companies in the world wrote various operating systems (CP/M, Posix, PDos, Tripos, Pluto...) and languages (Fortran, Lisp, Pascal...) for the Sage IV. \n\nAlthough Sage systems were the fastest personal systems of their days, and were intensively used by scientists and engineers for more than ten years, they are now totally forgotten, and so are all their powerful related OS\u0027s and software.\n_______________________",

It was designed with both eyes fixed firmly on the future. So that whatever shape the future takes, we\u0027ll be able to fit it into the system. Just as simply as the peripherals and software already available fit into the system. That way, the system will grow with you. And you\u0027ll never get left behind. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Based around the Z80A microprocessor, and utilising Microsoft BASIC, Aquarius has 8K ROM and 4K RAM resident within its console. It is able to provide up to 16 colours and resolution of 320 x 192, and generates its sound directly through the television\u0027s speakers. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; With twin cartridge ports, the mini-expander allows simultaneous use of additional RAM and software cartrldges. Twin disc game hand controls are included and the unit provides two additional sound channels. The 16K RAM cartridge plugs into either the console or the mini-expander, increasing Aquarius\u0027s RAM capacity to 20K. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; With the ability to reproduce the entire graphic and character set of Aquarius at 80 characters a second, the printer\u0027s 40 column output allows transcription of the complete monitor image. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Using standard audio cassettes, the data recorder provides storage for programs and information, and allows the use of cassette based software. Incorporating a digital tape counter and transmission indicator, it operates sequential searching. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; A large number of games, designed to take advantage of Aquarius\u0027s sophisticated colour and sound capabilities, are available on cartridges that plug into the console either direct, or through the mini-expander. Cassette based games can be used via the data recorder. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; A wide range of preprogrammed cartridges is available, including the LOGO teaching program and practical home data systems like FILEFORM and the spreadsheet calculator package FINFORM. \u0026lt;/font\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
