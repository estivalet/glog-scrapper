  "description": "\nThanks to Michael Hoyle for this information:\n\nThe HeadStart had two models. HeadStart VPU and HeadStart ATS.\n\nThe VPU was an impressive machine. It was a portable or a desktop machine.\nNotice the picture has a smaller keyboard that snapped on the front bezel\nand a handle on the back. No customers ordered the portable version.\n\nThe VPU had a Z-80 and an 8086 and could support up to 1MB RAM. Inside the\ncomputer consisted of three circuit boards. Two (over the top of the CRT)\nwas the processor and the RAM. The 1MB RAM took up a whole board.\n\nThe unit had a 3?\u0026quot; diskette drive that read Intertec\u0027s proprietary formats. The\nmachine could convert CP/M 2.2 format and MS-DOS 2.1 format data. The\nmachine had a coaxial network board (proprietary protocols) that connected\none of two server machines. A 10/20MB and a 50 MB.\n\nThe machine was not popular because of:\n- CP/M was dying, no one thought 3?\u0026quot; drives would be accepted (I think this\nwas the first to install 3?\u0026quot; drives),\n- IBM compatibility (Lotus 123) was a huge issue.\n\nThe IBM compatible ATS was created to answer these objections. The diskette was dropped out and an external 5? drive was added. The machine was sold with IBM PC-DOS 3.1 OS. It ran Lotus 123 and others and was very fast. It\nmaintained the local area network capability. The ATS downfall was\nmonochrome video, an external drive and no hard drive.\n\nIntertec stopped production of the HeadStart in 1984 and the company reduced\nitself to 12 employees. Service of the HeadStart continued however. A\nNetherlands company picked up the HeadStart name illegally (I remember a\nwrestler was used as the spokesperson for them). The legal issues were\nresolved out of court.\n\nIntertec was a public company. The name was changed to Wells American\nCorporation around 1985.\nIn 1985 Wells American began production of the A*Star. The A*Star was an IBM XT compatible that was exactly like the IBM. It used the 80286 and the speed could be switched: A*Star I 6/8 MHz, A*Star II 6/8/10/12/14/16 MHz. The\nA*Star used PC-DOS 3.x OS and would accept any of the IBM add-ons. Top\nmemory was 1MB. The proprietary network was included with the A*Star I and\nwas promoted as network ready. Wells American added an ISA bus NIC to allow\nIBM compatibles to access the HeadStart file servers. \n\nThe successful A*Star was sold directly to the enduser and was the first to\nbreak the $1000 barrier. The A*Star was never updated beyond the 80286 by\nWells American. A*Star\u0027s were sold with a 30 day money back guarantee,\non-site serviced by RCA/GE Computer services and guaranteed compatibility\nwith IBM software and hardware add-ons.\n\nAfter the A*Star, Wells American designed a dual bus 80286/80386 machine\ncalled the CompuStar I. This machine was a floor standing tower and was\ndesigned with the first processor local bus. A separate motherboard held the\nbus interface circuitry. The bus architecture could have been a combination\nof Microchannel or ISA. Only ISA was ordered as microchannel was a flop. The\nCompuStar had a single board processor (proprietary design) that was\ninterchangeable. An 80286 machine could be switched to an 80386 in 10 min.\nThe case was built from extruded aluminum and was a hefty design. \u0026quot;The Robb\nReport\u0026quot; picked the CompuStar I as the \u0026quot;Ultimate\u0026quot; computer and it received\nthe highest rating given to any hardware product by \u0026quot;Infoworld\u0026quot; magazine for\nthe year it was reviewed. 386 processor speeds reached 16/20/25MHz.\n\nThe CompuStar II in contrast was a very small machine. It had\ninterchangeable processor boards but only the ISA bus. It could mount 3 half\nheight 5? drives and a 3? fixed drive. Each of the CompuStar machines could\nhold up to 16MB RAM. 80386 Processor speeds were 16/20/25/33 MHz.\n\nWith the recession of 1988/9 the expensive CompuStar sales slowed and Wells\nAmerican could not keep up financially, declaring bankruptcy.\nThe A*Star and CompuStar trademarks were sold to CornerStone Technologies,\nInc., in SC. The A*Star is still manufactured by CornerStone.\n\nI was the production manager when the A*Star was first produced and then\nbecame the Product Manager for the A*Star and CompuStar lines. I am the\nPresident of CornerStone Technologies, Inc. so I have been building the\nA*Star since 1985.\n \n\n\n",
