  "description": "\nThe Horizon was a S-100 bus based system. It was the first floppy-disc based system hobbyists could buy. In a case with a choice of wood or blue metal cover, the basic version included a 4 Mhz. Z80 microprocessor, 16 KB of RAM, a 90 KB 5\u0027\u00271/4 floppy drive with a controller card, a serial terminal interface and 12 S-100 slots. It was sold with the North Star Disc Operating System and a Basic interpreter allowing random and sequential disk files. The Horizon-2 version offered a second floppy-disc drive.\n\nAny S-100 cards (compatible with Altair, Cromemco and many other systems) could be added to the system, but North Star provided its own additional 16 KB RAM and hardware floating point boards.\n\nIn 1979, original 90 KB floppy drives were replaced by Shugart 360 KB models. Northstar also offered an add-on box with two additional floppies, making a total of 4. The box had a matching walnut stained plywood cover.\n_______________________",

The chassis also provides a 12-slot S-100 mother board which contains a Real-Time Interrupt, two RS-232C serial ports, one 8-bit parallel port and power regulation circuitry for the integrated floppy disk drives. Either a 115 or 230 volt power supply with sufficient power for all 12 slots and the disk drives is also included. The use of high speed (200 nsec) Dynamic RAM and \u0026quot;fast stepping\u0026quot; floppy disk drives, along with the 4 MHz CPU, delivers the highest average performance of all comparable microcomputers as measured by independent benchmark studies! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;SOFTWARE\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The power and versatility of the HORIZON computer is further enhanced by a wide range of system and application software.

For the scientific, engineering, or education oriented user, North Star\u0027s powerful DOS operating system with its efficient BASIC or Pascal languages are available.
