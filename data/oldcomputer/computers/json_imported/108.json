  "description": "\nThe following information comes from Death Adder :\n\nOne of the rarest Commodore machines ever. Only very few units have been built with case, a few (more) without. As opposed to the widely held opinion, this computer is NOT called \u0027C64 laptop\u0027.\n\nCommodore developed this 3 pounds laptop in 1984 and presented it to the public at the Consumer Eletronics Show in January 1985 (Winter CES). In contradiction to what you might think when you first hear of a Commodore laptop, this machine has nearly nothing to do with the Commodore 64 or the Commodore 128 - alas.\n\nThe factory population was 32k of static CMOS RAM, internally expandable to 64k using standard memory chips. It was externally expandable with another 64k of RAM.\n\nIts display was one of the best on the market available at that time, made by Commodore\u0027s own optoelectronics division, which was sold off shortly after the C\u003dLCD was cancelled. The resolution in graphics mode was 480x128, and 80x16 in text mode. Although only 16 lines could be displayed simultaneously, the virtual screen size was 25 lines.\n\nLike the Commodore 264 series (Plus/4, C16, C116), the Commodore LCD had built-in software, but as opposed to the unfaithful 264 series, the software was by far better. The 96k of CMOS ROM contained the following software, some of which was incomplete in the prototype shown on the Winter CES:\n\n- wordprocessor and spreadsheet - both could be worked on using a split-screen display, with the spreadsheet supporting scrolling even in this split-screen format. The spreadsheet engineer stated that it will be faster at moving a thousand cells than Lotus 1-2-3 on an IBM PC.\n- Address manager and planner\n- Pocket calculator \n- Filemanager \n- Memo pad \n- Monitor \n- Terminal program \n- BASIC 3.6\n\nThe main menu offered a few utilities for copying from the internal RAM disk to an external drive, or for downloading over the built-in modem (which was also supported by the BASIC 3.6 by an OPEN statement) or the RS232 port.\nBoth memo pad and calculator (which had also hex and binary mode) could be invoked with a single keystroke at any time without interfering with the running program.\n\nThe BASIC 3.6 is - with the exception of a few commands which are useless for the CLCD, like COLOR - almost downward compatible with BASIC 7.0. It also supports high resolution graphic commands, just like the Plus/4.\n\nThe terminal program is of use, indeed, since the CLCD has a built in 300bps auto answer/auto-dial modem. Additionally, the C\u003dLCD has a separate RS232C port, so there is no need to attach a userport-to-RS232C adapter for a \u0027real\u0027 serial port. Commodore also decided to integrate a standard centronics port; rather unusual (at least for that time) is the HP compatible barcode port.\n\nLacking a builtin floppy drive, the LCD came with a serial IEC port, which was compatible with all Commodore serial peripherals. Above that, Commodore showed prototypes of an external 3.5\u0026quot; serial floppy drive, the 1561, which was also battery-powered.\n\nA prototypical battery-powered thermal transfer printer with an excellent NLQ image was produced, but didn\u0027t make it to the market, either.\n\nAlthough this laptop didn\u0027t have an external video output, Jeff Porter stated that his team was thinking about a cartridge for the C\u003dLCD which provided 80 column display for an external video display, using the C128\u0027s video chip.\n\nHere is an article by Benn Dunnington, from Commodore Info magazine issue #6 (1985) about a CES coverage:\n\n\u0026quot;[snip]...Now I pinch myself to make sure I\u0027m not dreaming (where\u0027s Herbie when you need him?): there before our eyes is a working model of a Commodore lap computer with a remarkably readable 80 column X 16 line liquid crystal display! I run ouer to a guy demonstrating one of these units to ask a few questions. He turns out to be Jeffrey Porter, one of the co-designers of the LCD (as it is called). We are surprised at how young and intelligent he looks (we have met \u0027project\u0027 types from Commodore before who would not necessarily fit\nthis description). While we take turns vigorously shaking his hand, Jeff explains that he is a former C-64 \u0027hacker\u0027 like us, and was recruited by Comnodore to design \u0026quot;the machine you\u0027d want for yourself\u0026quot;. What a concept!\n\nWe stop to read our product sheets,[stop here and read your LCD press sheets] I take_ a close-up photo of the keyboard noticing that it is different from the one shown in the standard press photos in our kit. Jeff explains that the press kit photos are of early mock-ups, and that the close-fitting keys of the unit on display would be used in actual production. We agree that they have a nice feel, and look better than the earlier version.\n\nWe are slightly disappointed to learn that the LCD is not C-64 software-compatible, but are impressed with the extensive built-in software which looks much more professional than the PLUS/4 built-ins. I knouw a lot of people that will be delighted with the built in MODEM and the on-board terminal software which can emulate both the DEC VT52 \u0026amp; VT100 terminals. I mentally go over some of the other pluses: 5hrs. operation on 4 penlight batteries, only 5lbs. total\nweight, fits in my briefcase, compatible with all C-64 peripherals, expected price- under $500) I ask Jeff about some items not covered by the press\nmaterials; Is the 32K RAM expandable? Jeff thinks it will be, but doesn\u0027t say by how much; does the use of the 6502-compatible 65C102 processor mean that the\nLCD will be able to use Bill Plensch\u0027s fabled 65816 Superchip\u0026quot; from Western Design Center [see \u0027News \u0026amp; Views\u0027, iss. #5] ? a smile flickers over Jeff\u0027s\nlips, and his eyes go slightly out of focus as he replies simply, \u0026quot;We\u0027re talking about it.\u0026quot;\n\nWe also want to know more about the 3.5\u0026quot; micro-floppy we see hooked up to the LCD. Al we can find out is that it is a \u0026quot;Sony-compatible\u0026quot; drive that hooks up to the serial port of any of the Conmodore computers (the peculiar thing is that, while other 3.5\u0026quot; drives typically store 1/2 to 1 full megabyte, we are told that this unit will only store a measly 170K- just like the 1541 ! \u0026quot;Why\u0026quot; was not explained).\u0026quot;\n\n____________\n\nBil Herd, ex Commodore Engineer, reports  :\nThe LCD project had orders for over 15,000 units in place before it was cancelled. Apparently the Commodore executive who was responsible for this product (Marshall Smith) was convinced during a conversation with a Tandy (Radio Shack) executive that there was no future in LCD notebook computers.  Tandy, of course, went on to sell huge numbers of the model 100,102 and 200 LCD notebook computers!\n \n\n\n",

It uses a special tape called \u0027Wafer\u0027, of 16, 64 or 128 Kb capacity. This wafer was also used by a product marketed for the \u0026lt;$223$\u0026gt;Sinclair Spectrum\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, called Wafadrive. Various tests proved that the Q.D.D. was approximately 20 times faster than a normal cassette recorder and 2 or 3 times faster than the Commodore 1541 disk drive. The reason : data transfer routines (called QOS) much more efficient than those of Commodore, and a file management operating system (FMU) much more modern and powerful. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The Q.D.D. is however not more than an advanced tape recorder using a magnetic tape, and the delay to access a specific file still remains higher than with a normal disk drive. Despite its qualities, the Q.D.D. did not meet success because most C64 software was sold on disks or tapes and users had to acquire both Commodore peripherals before investing in a third powerful storage system.\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;"
