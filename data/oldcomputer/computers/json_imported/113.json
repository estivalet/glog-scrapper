  "description": "\nCROMEMCO was founded in 1974 by two Stanford Students, Roger Melen and Harry Garland, who lived in the CROthers MEMorial Hall dormitory on the Stanford campus.\nEventually CROMEMCO needed space to receive visitors, and moved out of the dorm to Mountain View, and incorporated in 1976. Early products were cards for the S-100 bus, as used by the Altair and IMSAI computers. \n\nThese computers were built around the S100 bus. The S100 BUS was a standard (also known under the name IEEE 696) for connection on Zilog Z80 or Intel 8080 processors. A lot of S100 cards were available for the Cromenco systems. \n\nFour Cromenco systems were available :\n\n- System 0: Z80 A + RAM 64 KB + 2 floppy disk drives (390 KB each),\n- System I: As system 0 + 1 hard disk (5 MB).\n- System III: Z80 CPU, Dual 8\u0026quot; Persci electrically driven floppy drives, 64 KB RAM. It was S-100 bus, Multiuser, used MP/M operating system.\n\nIn 1982, Cromemco also introduced the CS-1H system using a dual processor board (Motorola 68000 and Z80) and offering 16 MB of address space.\n\nFor the moment, we don\u0027t know exactly the specific features for the Systems II and IV.\n\nThese systems ran under Cromix (the Cromenco Unix version). They could run under CP/M and CDOS too (CDOS is a CP/M like operating system). Several languages were developped especially for these computers : Fortran IV or a 16 K Z80 Basic wich was given as \u0026quot;one of the fastest and most capable. Full 14-digit precision\u0026quot;.\n \n\n\n",
