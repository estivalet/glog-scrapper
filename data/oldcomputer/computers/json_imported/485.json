  "description": "\nThese two computers (P3 and P4) are professional systems conceived by Triumph-Adler. There are based on 8085A CPU and have 64k RAM.\n\nThey used the MOS operating system but are also CP/M compatible. There were delivered with CP/M, UCSD-P System and Holland Automation on disks.\n\nThe difference between the two models is that the P3 is equiped with two 5\u0027\u00271/4 (785 kb formated) floppy-drives, whereas the P4 has one floppy and one hard-disk (5 Mb).\n \n\n\n",

Whether your needs as a user ore for personal programming, games playing, scientific or process control, educational or business use the MTX Series is already capable or very easily adoptable to almost every application. Glance through the standard features below - you\u0027ll see what we mean.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Software\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The MTX\u0027s 24K ROM contains several languages and routines which enable the novice or the experienced programmer to make full use of the machine. Standard languages are MTX BASIC, MTX LOGO commands, NODDY. ROM routines include on ASSSEMBLER/DISASSEMBLER with screen display of the Z80 CPU registers, memory and program, which can be manipulated from the keyboard. Machine code programs can be stepped through one instruction at a time, and easily called from within BASIC programs. A further feature is the Virtual Screen facility which enables the programmer to split the screen into a maximum of eight sections to work independently whilst maIntaining all full screen facilities. Pascal is available as on add-on ROM pock.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Hardware - 32K RAM on the MTX500. 64K on the MTX512.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The MTX500 has 32K of user RAM as standard (64K on the 512), expandable to 512K plus 16K of video RAM, controlled by a separate Video Processor. Sixteen colours, 40 column text, 256 x 192 high resolution graphics with all sixteen colours available, and 32 easily moveable user defined graphics characters (Sprites) combine to make effective screen displays quick and simple to achieve. Standard outputs are centronics printer port, two ioystick ports, an uncommitted I/O port, 2400 Baud Cassette port, separate TV and Video Monitor ports, 4 channel sound with hifi output plus a dedicated cartridge port. Other standard features include the Z80A processor runnIng at 4MHz, real time clock, full moving key keyboard with 79 keys including eight 2-function keys and separate numeric pad.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The Disc Based Computers from Memotech.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Designed to use the full power of the MTX computers the FDX and HDX make perfect busIness systems at prices which make perfect business sense.
