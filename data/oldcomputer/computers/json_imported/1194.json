  "description": "\nThe RAIR Business Computer is an obscure system since nearly nothing can be found on the net about it (apart from here :-))\n\nThe Business Computer is a multipost system. It can control/serve up to 4 attached terminal stations via RS422 connectors.\n\nIts main particularity is to mix two technologies: 8-bit with its Intel 8085 CPU and 16-bit with its Intel 8088 CPU. Thus it can run CP/M, MP/M and PC-DOS software with no problem (according to the advert).\n\nFor mass storage, the system is equiped with a 19 MB Winchester hard-disk (up to 4 can be mounted) and a 5.25\u0027\u0027 1 MB floppy drive.\n_______________________",
