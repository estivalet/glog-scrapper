  "description": "\nThis professional computer from NEC was a very nice system at the time. With its high resolution graphics (640 x 475) and its large disk capacity (1 MB), it sure was impressive in 1982!\n\nBill Czermak recalls:\nI developed the first version of MIPS (Manufacturers Integrated Production System) on one of the first colour APCs sold in Australia.  I added a 5 Mb NEC harddisk later.  The 8\u0026quot; floppies held 1.2 Mb.\nI am told my original system is in a museum in the Geelong area.\n\nI added an XT compatibility card to port my software to the the IBM XT and my software worked fine using this card.  When I installed it on a customer\u0027s genuine IBM, I got a blank screen!!!  Which I fixed that day on the customer\u0027s premesis.  I think the APC was 30% faster than the XT and cheaper with better graphics.\n\nJeremiah S. Junken reports :\nI actually have one of these which still works. By default, it runs CPM/86, there was a UNIX available, and MS-DOS available. Mine had an external 10MB HDD. The software included \u0026quot;benchmark\u0026quot; word processor, VisiCalc and dBase II.\n\nThe major things worth nothing about this otherwise unremarkable machine were it\u0027s relative speed, the fact that the lights would dim slightly when it was turned on, and that, in the year 2002, it still works. :-)\n\nGary McCray adds:\nI actually still have a working one of these also. Actually, it was pretty remarakable when it came out for its high resolution graphics capability using a (at the time) powerful NEC 7220 Graphics controller chip which formed the base strategy for virtually every other graphics controller since.\n\nUnfortunately very little software was available that took advantage of its graphics capability. Also it was featured in one of the stupidist full page ads ever produced and ran for months with a giant hand covering it up and the admonition \u0026quot;The Computer The Competition Doesnt Want You to See\u0026quot; and a suggestion to write away for information on it (see \u0027Adverts\u0027 section). If that wasn\u0027t stupid enough, you couldn\u0027t actually get any information on it from either writing or calling.\n\nIt is remarkably well made and was extremely powerful and reliable in the time it was built (weighs over 80 lb). But a combination of truly stupid advertising and lack of easy access doomed it in the US to a very small group. It fared much better in Japan understandably, and surprisingly in Australia (no giant hand I guess). I developed graphics authoring programs for it that sold successfully in both Japan and Australia.\n\n \n\n\n",

Very impressive.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; When I got the machine, I wanted to communicate with bulletin boards and MCI but there was no comm software so I wound up writing my own and used it for several years until buying an IBM clone(UG!).\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I also have a 10 meg hard drive which looks like a shoebox but at the time was state of the art.
