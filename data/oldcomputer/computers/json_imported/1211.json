  "description": "\nThe Tandy 1000 HX is a member of the Tandy 1000 series family. See this entry for more info.\n\nThe Tandy 1000 HX, released in 1987, was designed as another entry level IBM compatible personal computer and the successor to the EX. Like the EX, the HX was a compact computer with the keyboard built into the computer casing. The computer came with an Intel 8088 CPU, 256 KB of memory, and had one 720 KB 3.5\u0026quot; disk drive on the right side of the machine behind the keyboard.\nHX computers came with MS-DOS 2.11 built into the ROM and ?Deskmate 2? on diskette.\n\nThe computer\u0027s memory could be expanded to 640 KB by the use of a memory expansion card; by default these cards, sold by Tandy, came with 128 KB, but one could add another 384 KB in memory chips to this board. These cards were named ?Plus Cards? and used a pin configuration instead of the slot system used by IBM or the T-1000. The cards themselves followed all the IBM standards and eventually Radio Shack started selling the adaptors in their stores to allow the cards to be inserted into a standard IBM 8-bit ISA slot. There were three such spots available in the computer case.\n\nThere was also a spare 3.5\u0026quot; drive bay in the computer case. On the back of the machine there was a port which allowed a user to connect an external 5.25\u0026quot; (360 KB) or 3.5\u0026quot; (720 KB) disk drive. There was also a connector for a printer.\n\nThe 1000 HX did not come with a hard drive, and Tandy Corporation did not manufacture fixed disks for this type of computer. A HDD could be purchased from third party vendors, however.\n\nIt was also here that the DOS in ROM was getting a little old and for the first time the settings on the computer could be changed so that instead of looking in ROM for DOS at bootup, it would go direct to the floppy drive instead. Most versions of MS-DOS worked with the 1000 HX, including 3.x, DOS 5.x \u0026amp; 6.x. DOS 4.0 did not work due to a bug in its environment that prevented it from working.\n\n__________\n\nContributors: Derek McDonald (aka ?Skel?)\nSources: Switchtec\u0027s Virtual PC Museum, Emperor Multimedia Electronic Archives, Wikipedia, 8-Bit Micro, Tandy 1000 PC Museum\n \n\n\n",
