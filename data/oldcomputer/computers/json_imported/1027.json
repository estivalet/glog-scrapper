  "description": "\nLittle is known about this computer. Help welcomed ! Silex means flint in french, a stone mainly used in prehistoric times as tools and weapons.\n\nThe SILEX is a professional computer released in 1979 by the french company Leanord. It was conceived from a modified Apple II board.\n\nIt has a professional keyboard with function keypad and numeric keypad. The display is built-in the system. It is monochrome but has graphic capabilities (280 x 192) and can display 40 x 24 characters (80 x 24 in option). To the right of the display is a 5.25\u0027\u0027 disk-drive built-in the case (143 KB). Additional storage media will be available later (high density disk drives and hard disks).\n\nDifferent languages were available : extended BASIC (in english and in french!), PASCAL, \u0026quot;evoluated disk operating system\u0026quot;...\n\nThe fact that there is so little information about the Silex, makes us believe that it had a very short life, at least under this name, since SIL\u0027Z systems from the same company seem to be an evolution of the Silex. SIL\u0027Z systems had some success, particularly in french administrations and schools.\n \n\n\n",
