  "description": "\nIn 1986 the Acorn Business Computer range was long gone, and Olivetti -\nAcorn\u0027s new owners, having been forced to increase their stake from 49\nto 80 per cent of the firm - were concentrating on making Acorn more\nprofitable. The case for the 65C816-based Communicator was retained and\ngiven a basic box, housing a PSU and disk drive, to make a standard-looking 3-box computer system based around the BBC Master architecture.\n\nAlso marketed in Europe as the Olivetti Prodest PC 128 S (S for Sistema), the Master compact differed from other computers in a number of annoying ways. Most confusing was the decision to keep the computer in the keyboard, with suitable reductions in available interfaces and features such as the real-time clock - making the Master Compact rather like a grown up Electron (however, home marketing would unfortunately not be attempted - it would have been considerably more successful). The \u0027CPU\u0027 was connected via a large ribbon cable and a jack plug. The monitor connected to the \u0027keyboard\u0027. It was, to be blunt, a mess.\n\nHowever, the system did introduce the 3.5\u0026quot; drive as a standard to the 8-bit BBC range and featured all the usual Master enhancements plus a mouse/joystick port. As a school computer - the traditional market - it differed just enough to make it relatively unpopular, lacking the user and 1MHz bus ports used by many educational devices, and being (by nature of its smaller case) somewhat easier to steal and damage. The Compact was discontinued very early on, the introduction of the A305 Archimedes offering a similar \u0027format\u0027 of machine, but with all the benefits associated with Acorn - expandability, speed, and reliability. The original one-box Master 128 continued to sell until 1993... \n\nOlivetti were to get their own back for the Compact - Acorn sold a\nbranded version of the Olivetti M19 \u0027PC Compatible\u0027, a rather dated 8088-based machine.\n\nThe Olivetti Prodest 128 can be seen in the kid\u0027s film \u0027Treasure Island in Space\u0027 - an Italian production, most likely. The computer is recognizable by its blue and white display.\n\n\n_______\n\nInfo, texts and picture by Richard Kilpatrick\n\n \n\n\n",
