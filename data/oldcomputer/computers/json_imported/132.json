  "description": "\nLike its little brothers Goupil and Goupil 2, the Goupil 3 is based on a back-plane architecture. You get the computer you want by adding different electronic boards. Thus Goupil 3 can be a tri-processor system: Motorola 6809 like its little brothers, Zilog Z80 for CP/M compatibility and Intel 8088 to match the emerging \u0026quot;IBM PC/MS-DOS\u0026quot; movement.  The processors don\u0027t work simultaneously but can use a time sharing mechanism.\n\nLike the Goupil 2, the Goupil 3 was especially designed for communication, and thus had a built-in modem. Among other things it can emulate the Minitel (French videotext terminal) or connect to data centers.\n\nThe 5.25\u0026quot; floppy disk drive can be replaced with an 8\u0026quot; drive (1.2 MB). A 10 MB hard disk was also available as an option.\n\nThe Goupil 3 can run under a lot of operating systems: Flex 9 or Uniflex (with the 6809), CP/M (with the Z80) or CP/M 86 or MS-DOS with the 8088.\n \n\n\n",
