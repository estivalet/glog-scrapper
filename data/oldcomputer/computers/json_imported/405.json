  "description": "\nThe NEC TK 80 is a 8080-cpu Training Kit (hence the \u0026quot;TK\u0026quot;) computer sold at the end of the 70\u0027s. It is considered the first japanese home-computer. It was firstly aimed at technicians, but it met a great success with first computer hobbyists. It was often sold as a kit.\n\nThe systems is directly programmed in machine-code through the hexadecimal keyboard. There are 9 \u0026quot;function\u0026quot; keys on this keyboard : RET, RUN, STORE DATA, LOAD DATA, RESET, ADRS SET, READ INCR, READ DECR, WRITE INCR.\nInformation is displayed on the built-in 7-segments LED display (1 line, 8 characters).\n\nThe TK-80E is low-cost TK-80. The CPU and some chips are slightly different (uPD8080AD -\u0026gt; uPD8080AFC, uPD8228D -\u0026gt; uPD8228C, uPD454D -\u0026gt; uPD464C, uPD5101E -\u0026gt; uPD2101AL-4), thus reducing the production cost (ceramic -\u0026gt; plastic). Of course the TK-80E was less expensive.\n\nThe TK-80 BS was a \u0026quot;Basic Station\u0026quot; model. It was composed of a TK-80 board with a BASIC ROM built-in, 7k RAM and an alphanumeric keyboard. Furthermore there was the Compo BS/80 which was a TK-80 with its Basic extension within a nice moulded plastic case.\n\nThe TK-80 was used as a base for the PC-8001, the PC-8801 and the PC-9801.\n\n\n___________\n\nPicture courtesy of Electric Brain Museum.\n \n\n\n",
