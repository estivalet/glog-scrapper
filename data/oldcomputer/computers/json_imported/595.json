  "description": "\nLNW company name came from its three founders\u0027 names: Gene Lu, Michael G. Norton (President) and Ken Woog. In 1980, the company started manufacturing expansion and interface cards for the Tandy TRS-80 Model 1 and then sold the first TRS-80 compatible single-board kit. \n\nThe LNW-80 was an early TRS-80 clone system, sold as a kit or assembled, and fully hardware and software compatible. It was a powerful machine offering much more advanced features than the original Model 1, including most features found on the TRS-80 expansion interface:\n\n- Two selectable speeds, 1.77 Mhz (Tandy original) and 4 Mhz.\n- 8 colours, 480 x 192 high resolution graphics\n- RGB and monochrome monitor outputs\n- Expanded keyboard with numeric keypad\n- Versatile floppy disk controler for single/double sided 5.25\u0026quot; or 8\u0026quot; disks, single or double density format\n- Serial RS-232C and Parallel interfaces.\n\nLater, LNW sold two other computers, the LN80 II and the LN80 TEAM, a MS-DOS based system (no info at the moment).\n\nIn 1984 the company went bankrupt mainly because of its warehouse burglary, as all of its computers stock disapeared! \n \n\n\n",
