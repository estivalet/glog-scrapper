  "description": "\nThe Oric Telestrat is the successor of the Oric 1 and Oric Atmos with which it is compatible. It was launched some months after Oric was bought by Eur?ka, a French company in 1985.\n\nIt was designed especially for telecommunications, like the Goupil 2, the Thomson TO-9+ or the Exeltel. It was designed to be used with the Minitel (French videotext terminal): it has a special ROM (8 KB) enabling the Telestrat to act as a videotext server.\n\nA 3\u0026quot; floppy disk drive was available (400 KB) which run under StradSED (the Oric operating system, compatible with the old Oric DOS).\n\nSeveral ROM cartridges were developed for this machine: Midi software (unreleased), Hyper Basic (compiled basic), Telematic Basic (designed for telecommunications), etc...\n \n\n\n",
