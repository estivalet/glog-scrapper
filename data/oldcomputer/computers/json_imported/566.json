  "description": "\nThe Vector 1 was a clone of the ALTAIR 8800 based on the common S-100 bus structure and the Intel 8080A microprocessor. It was sold under kit or assembled versions.\n\nVector Graphics said it offered a stronger cabinet and a well-designed power supply. To reduce selling price, front panel didn\u0027t offer any switch or control led. In its basic version, the computer could be connected to a tape recorder and a serial terminal and offered a bootstrap ROM monitor.\n_______________________",
