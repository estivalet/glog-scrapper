  "description": "\nThe Cromemco Z-1 uses an IMSAI chassis, with 22 card slots and a 28 amperes (about 300 watts) power supply. The major innovation of the Z-1 is the use of the 4 Mhz version of the Z-80 processor. It is also equiped with its own 2708 type EPROM burner card.\n\nLike the IMSAI, the Basic version of the Cromemco Z-1 is programmed through the front panel switches, and results are read from the front panel leds... Hopefuly, it is possible to connect a standard Video terminal through the serial port.\n \n\n\n",

It uses the standard \u0027\u0027S100\u0027\u0027 bus supported by over a dozen manufacturers. And all Cromemco peripherals (PROM memory and programmer, Ram memory, analog I/O, color TV interface, etc) just plug into the Z1\u0027s sockets...\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; ... The Z-1 comes completely assembled ans tested. It\u0027s a quality, commercial grade microcomputer. It is not available as a kit.\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
