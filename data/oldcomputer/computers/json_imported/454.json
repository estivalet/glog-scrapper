  "description": "\nRAIR was a very early UK manufacturer of 8085-based systems and eventually licensed its designs to ICL.\n\nThis obscure system was sold with a hard-disk and a 5\u0026quot;1/4 disk-drive built-in. It was conceived to be used as a multi-user system.\n\nThe following languages were available : Basic, Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, PL/1.\n\nMore information about Black Box internal hardware in the ICL Personal computer page.\n\nPictured here is a model 3/30.\n\n_______________________\n",
