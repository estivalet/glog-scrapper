  "description": "\nWhen NCR discontinued the PC4 they released the PC6. This was a true IBM PC/XT clone. \n\nIt had a discrete CPU unit and monitor. It also had a \u0026quot;turbo\u0026quot; button to change the clock on the 8088 CPU from 4.77 to 8 MHz, processing information nearly twice as fast as the PC XT. It was available with either monochrome or CGA graphics. It was bundled with NCR-DOS, GW-BASIC, Getting Started booklet, NCR User Interface, NCR PAL, NCR TUTOR, On-line NCR HELP, and User Diagnostics.\n\nPictures and info needed !\n \n\n\n",
