  "description": "\nPeerless was a company that was started by some of the former employees\nof AM International - Jacquard.\n\nPeerless built a computer and 4 terminal control boards that would run Jacquard\u0027s OS. The computer was compact very much like the pc towers that we have now.\n\nThis very good system ran all the software that were written for the Jacquard, but it was very pricey, 20-30 thousand dollars just for the base unit...\n\nThat was about the time IBM PC came out , the PC doomed the Peerless and the Jacquard systems. Peerless did come out with a board that allowed a PC to run as a Peerless Jacquard terminal over Arcnet\nnetwork.\n\nNASA bought a lot of these peerless systems to replace the numerous Jacquard systems that they had, mainly for word processing.\n\nThe peerless was a good replacement for the Jacquard system but by the time it was coming out when the market was moving to the IBM PC.\n\nThanks to Randy Larson for information and pictures.\n \n\n\n",
