  "description": "\nThe Pasopia 16 is an IBM PC compatible system conceived in 1982. It had excellent features for its time ! An impressive resolution of 640 x 560 pixels, 192 KB RAM (up to 256 MB), two 5\u0027\u00271/4 disk-drives and an optional 10 MB hard-drive. It was possible to format the disks at half size (360 KB) for IBM compatibility. Finally, the Pasopia 16 was a successful machine in the market place.\n\nThe Pasopia 16 was sold in the US under the T300 name, and as the PAP in Europe or at least in France. PAP was short for \u0026quot;Papillon\u0026quot;, meaning butterfly in French. A small printed butterfly can thus be found on French models.\n\nPap.Com (comunication software) and Pap.Graph (graphic software) were included.\n \n\n\n",
