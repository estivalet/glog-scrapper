  "description": "\nAfter the success of the TRS-80 Pocket Computer (a.k.a. TRS-80 PC-1), Sharp also manufactured their PC-1500 (see there for more technical information) in a version for Tandy Radio Shack.\n\nThis machine was marketed as the TRS-80 PC-2 (catalog number 26-3601). Internally, it was exactly the same machine. Only the front face design had been changed: the keyboard layout was different, with an additional enter key, and the display had been shifted to the right. Moreover, the colour style was also slightly different, with a light gray instead of brown back of the case.\n\nSome peripherals supplied by Tandy were the \u0026quot;docking station\u0026quot; with 4 colour pen plotter and cassette interface (catalog number 26-3605), 4 and 8 KB RAM module (26-3615 and 26-3616), an external tape interface (26-3605) and an RS-232 interface (26-3612). Of course, all peripherals developed for the Sharp PC-1500 could also be used.\n\nThanks to Roman von Wartburg and his site for information and picture.\n \n\n\n",
