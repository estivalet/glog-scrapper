  "description": "\nThis business computer has a monitor and two 5.25\u0026quot; drives built-in. The drives had a door lock so the disk could not be removed while a file was open. The CX-1 uses MCX (Media for Canon X series) as its operating system, which is similar to CP/M.\n\nThe character matrix consists of 5x7 dots for normal characters, and of 7x9 for semi-graphic characters. There was a graphic option in Japan (300 x 260), but it never became available in the US.\n\nThe Canon BX-3 was the same machine except the CRT was replaced by a Fluorescent Display and a thermal printer.\n \n\n\n",

Simple to build, simple to operate. A powerful, full facility computer with all the features you would expect.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Just connect the assembled computer to any domestic TV and power source and you are ready to begin. (Power requirement: 8V at 800mA). There is an ATOM power unit available. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Free with every ATOM, kit or built, is a computer manual. The first section explains and teaches you BASIC, the language that most personal computers and the ATOM operate in. The instructions are simple and learning quickly becomes a pleasure. You\u0027ll soon be writing your own programs. The second section is a reference manual giving a full description of the ATOM\u0027s facilities and how to use them. Both sections arE fully illustrated with example programs. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The standard ATOM includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; HARDWARE\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .

As you build confidence and knowledge you can add more components. For instance the next stage might be to increase the ROM and RAM on the basic ATOM from 8K + 2K to 12K + 12K respectively. This will give you a direct printer drive, floating point mathematics, scientific and trigonometric functions, high resolution graphics.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; From there you can expand indefinitely. Acorn have produced an enormous range of compatible PCB\u0027s which can be added to your original computer. For instance: A module to give red, green and blue colour signals Teletext VDU card (for Prestel and Ceefax information) An in-board connector for a communications loop interface - any number of ATOMs may be linked to each other or to a master system with mass storage/hard copy facility. \u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Paul Durrant\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
