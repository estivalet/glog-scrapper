  "description": "\nWhen the C4P was launched, Ohio Scientific said that it was a giant step in the world of the home computers. It was twice as fast as an Apple ll or Commodore Pet and more than three times as fast as a Tandy TRS 80.\nHowever, despite its technological lead, the C4P and other Ohio Scientific computers always suffered of a lack in efficient software and attractive handbooks. For this reason, very few third companies built cards and peripherals for the Challenger series. So, the C4P didn\u0027t withstand to the competition of  the Apple II and II+ version which appeared 4 months later.\nHowever, Ohio Scientific sold it until 1981 as a business oriented system.\n\nIn March 1981, OSI was sold to \u0027M/A-Com\u0027 company, but the name did continue  until at least 1985. Some OSI based systems were also sold under the name OSITRON.\n\nIn 1979, two versions were sold:\nThe C4P basic version ($698) with:\n- 8KB Basic ROM\n- 8KB of static RAM expandable to 32KB\n- Audio tape interface.\nThe C4P MF ($1695) with all the features of the C4P plus:\n- 24KB RAM expandable to 48KB\n- 5\u0026quot; floppy-disc drive unit\n- Real time clock\n- Interfaces for Home Security System, parallel printer, modem\n- Bus connector.\nBrett Molotsky reports:\nThe Challenger 4P was also sold for a VERY brief time by JCPenney stores in a consumer-friendly version. It had an all-plastic case that was a bit more sleek and that looked much like an Apple II case. That\u0027s where we bought ours, along with a black and white TV and a cassette tape player.\n\nDavid Pelleg recalls:\nThe C4P was my first computer.  It was great except it had ONE MAJOR DESIGN FLAW which anyone who ever used it would know quite well.  That was the placement of the reset key directly adjacent to the (very small) enter key.  One little touch of reset and EVERYTHING you had been working on was wiped out instantly.  That is why I\u0027m so paranoid about constantly saving files even today (where it takes ctrl-alt-delete plus \u0026quot;Are you sure you would like to restart?\u0026quot;).\n \n\n\n",

If it had, that would have been amazing for the price way back then.  Instead, it had a 32x64 character display and claimed that because each character was made up of a 8x8 grid that that was supposed to count as 256x512 graphics.  Even given that they used an extended 8 bit character set that included special line and shape characters, you were NEVER able to address indivual pixels!\u0026lt;/font\u0026gt;       \u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
