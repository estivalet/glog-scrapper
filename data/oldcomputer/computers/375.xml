The FM-77AV40SX was the last FM-77 series machine, Audio-Visual expansion of  FM-77AV40EX.

About this computer, Nomura Hisayuki adds:
Some people said FM77AV40SX was the ultimate 8 bit computer. (Other people said that Hitachi S1 was this one.)
Its video-functions were remarkable.
- displays TV programs on it's video monitor,
- TV control from the keyboard,
- TV screen capture,
- displays subtitles on TV.
These functions were realized in the 80s!
260,000 color graphics was also marvelous.

The case colour which looked like the stone was beautiful. A lot of people called FM77AVSX a &amp;quot;tombstone&amp;quot;.
This PC was the last FM77 machine. So, FM77AV became a real tombstone of FM77.
