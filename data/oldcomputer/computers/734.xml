The Tiki-100 was a Norwegian educational, professional, homecomputer system that was quite popular in schools.

Acutally they first used the name Kontiki-data, and named the first few models Kontiki-100, but had to change the name to Tiki after the Thor Heyerdahl Society, wich owned the rights to the Kontiki name, threatened with a lawsuit.

Five models were available, featuring one or two 80 KB, 200 KB or 800 KB 5'' floppy disc drives. An optional 20MB Winchester harddrive was also available.
The Tiki-100 could read various disk formats, like Scandis, IBM-PC, Osborne, and ABC-800. The 80 KB format was the same as used in some Xerox-systems.
The operating-system was called TIKO, and was compatible with CP/M 2.2. It was first called KP/M, but was renamed at the same time as the computer changed the name from Kontiki-100 to Tiki-100.

One could also install an optional Intel-8088 processor-board, adding an extra 256 KB ram to the main 64 KB. A 16-bit operating system called TIKOS was used together with the i8088 board, and managed both the i8088 and Z80 at the same time. TIKOS was developed from CP/M-86, and was compatible with it. MS-DOS 2.11 was also available.

The Tiki-100 had 3 (maybe more?) graphics modes, but no text-mode as it used
bitmapped graphics only.
A separate network hub was available that allowed up to 8 (not sure) computers to be connected in a star topology. One of the standard Tiki's serial ports was used for the network, in high speed mode. The server was a Tiki-100 that ran MP/M.

Several programs were developed for the Tiki-100. Most common were: BRUM (a simple wordprocessor), Tiki-Kalk (Spreadsheet), Tiki-BAS (Database),WordStar and SuperCalc and a little snake-type game called Pyton.

 A simple terminal program was also imbedded in the OS, and made it possible to
connect to a BBS through a 300 or 1200 bps modem. A serial terminal could be
used to acces the Tiki-100 via one of the serial ports.

Program languages like: C, Fortran, Cobol, BASIC, Pascal was also available.
