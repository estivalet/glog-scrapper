        <description>
The Athena used the NSC 800 microprocessor which was a low consumption version of the Zilog Z80.

The computer had a battery which allowed it to be used for two hours or six hours in &amp;quot;awake&amp;quot; state.

Apparently it was the first &amp;quot;clamshell&amp;quot; laptop computer to be exhibited, but never went into production. It was designed by David Mitchell.
