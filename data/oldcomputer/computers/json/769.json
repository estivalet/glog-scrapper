  "description": "\nThe ACE 2000 series consisted of three computers the 2000, 2100, and the 2200.\nThe 2000 had no disk drives, the 2100 had one disk drive, and the 2200 had\ntwo disk drives. All featured a detachable keyboard, the same 1.02 MHz\n65SC02 processor, the usual scattering of expansion slots around the motherboard\nand the half-height case.\n\nGraphics modes and sound capabilities were in line with the Apple ][e. On the front panel,\nit had a row of LEDs for Power, Diagnostics, Double-high-res Graphics Mode,\nHi-res Graphics Mode, and CPU Activity.\n\nThe back panel featured RS-232 serial ports (2), 1 DB-25 parallel port, 15-pin RGB video, and the power cable. The case and power supply had integrated fans. The case had the\nindentations for areas of expansion cards to poke out and provide new\nconnectors; however, these expansion slots were not located in a nice row,\n1-6. Slot 1 was missing (this was the parallel port on the back), slots 2\nand 4 were combined into one slot (it was one or the other set via a jumper,\nnot both), slot 3 was located near the rear and ran left to right, not from\nto back, slot 5 was located on the right side of the case and faced outward\ntowards a screwplate covering the connector face and ran perpendicular to\nslot 3. Slot 6 was also missing, as it controlled the two disk drives.\n\nLow-res graphics mode provided 16 colors in a 320x200 array, with a 2-4 line\n\u0027text window\u0027 at the bottom of the screen. Hi-res graphics gave you 512 x 384\npixels at either 4, 6, or 7 colors (depending on which software\nwas used). There was supposedly another graphics mode, dubbed\n\u0027Double-High Resolution\u0027 which was supposed to give you 16 colors at\n512x384, but there was a dearth of information about how to program in it.\n\nThe Franklins could run AppleSoft BASIC and DOS 3.3, but they shipped with\nthe Franklin DOS 2 floppy FDOS 2. This allowed for such things as\nprogrammable function keys. Otherwise, there wasn\u0027t a whole lot different.\n\nFDOS and BASIC were the keys to the enhanced graphics modes. If you had it,\nyou could run Integer BASIC through a convoluted process. Booting Integer\nBASIC had an interesting secret: if you \u0027peeked\u0027 and \u0027poked\u0027 enough, you\u0027d\nfind the memory address for a reset. When Integer BASIC was reset, it\ndisplayed \u0027Apple ][\u0027 across the top of the screen. There were also numerous\nreferences to \u0027S. Wozniak\u0027 and \u0027S. Jobs\u0027 embedded in many of the programs Franklin delivered for it.\n\nThe Ace 2000 series was in fact the last Apple II compatibles made by Franklin. (~ 1987).  Franklin then tried manufacturing PC clones before finally devoting themselves to pocket translators.\n\nThanks to Nathan Shrider for all this info.\n \n\n\n",
