  "description": "\nThe Olivetti M-10 is basically the same computer as the Tandy 100 or the NEC PC-8201. All these machines were in fact conceived by Kyocera Corporation (Japan). Thus they all have very similar characteristics.\n\nOlivetti is well known for computers with special design, and the M-10 is not an exception. Compared to the Tandy 100 or NEC PC-8201, the M-10 is quite beautiful. The main physical difference is the LCD screen which can be tilted for user\u0027s comfort.\n\nJust like its brothers, the M-10 was used a lot by reporters all around the world. This success was mainly due to its excellent keyboard and large battery autonomy.\n\nThe M-10 a some built-in software :\n- An Extended Microsoft Basic\n- A wordprocessor\n- A small spreadsheet (adress files)\n- An Agenda\n- And a communication program.\n\nThe M10 had 4 standard RAM/ROM sockets, whereas all other Kyocera machines had specific RAM or ROM sockets.\n\nThe french model doesn\u0027t seem to have the modem built-in as it is the case for the \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; M-10. This is maybe because any Modem sold in France had to be \u0026quot;agreed\u0026quot; by the French Post Office (!), which was a difficult task...\n \n\n\n",
