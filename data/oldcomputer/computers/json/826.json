The smallest system featured 1 KB RAM and 4 KB ROM monitor, as well as serial and parallel ports.\nThe bigger system, designated Zero/D, had 64 KB of RAM and separate dual floppy disc drives unit. It was sold with CP/M operating system, printer drivers and self test diagnostics.\nIt was also possible to use a version of Unix called Cromix if a further 64 KB of RAM was installed.\n \n\n\n",
