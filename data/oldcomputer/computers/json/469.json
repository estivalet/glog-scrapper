  "description": "\nThe M-170 computer was originaly sold as a home computer but, as it was a very reliable system, many companies used it as a small business system. It was derived from the M-100, M-110 home systems.\n\nBasic version was supplied with a Hitachi monitor, an external power supply unit and a cassette recorder (the M-170 could manage two tape recorders simultaneously). There was no programming langage built in the computer, only a monitor including 19 commands. One of them allowed the user to load the Sord BASIC interpreter.\n\nThe ACE version used from one to three 5.25\u0026quot; - 143 KB floppy drives units with a more advanced BASIC interpreter, and a graphic display card. A FORTRAN compiler was also available.\n \n\n\n",
