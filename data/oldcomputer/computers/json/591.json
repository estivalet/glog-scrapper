  "description": "\nThe AS-100 is a 16-bit professional computer based on the Intel 8088 CPU. It has 128 KB RAM, built-in speaker, optional 8087 math co-processor and real time clock. The whole system (monitor + disks + keyboard) weights more than 30 Kg! The AS-100 is not a real IBM compatible system. It can use MS-DOS as its Operating System but that\u0027s all. \n\nThe computer can display 25 lines of 80 columns, or 640 x 400 pixels, with 8 colours from a total of 27. The character matrix consists of 9 x 7 pixels. There are 128 ASCII characters, and more user re-definable ones. Display attributes are inversed, underlined, wide, blink and masked. The computer was delivered with a monochrome or colour monitor (both 30 cm wide). \n\nDifferent optional drives could be connected:\n- one or two 5.25\u0026quot; FDD units, DS/DD, 640 KB each, 250 ms average access time, 250 KB/s average transfer rate\n- from one to four 8\u0026quot; FDD unit, DS/DD, 1.2 MB each, 200 ms average access time, 500 KB/s average transfer rate\n- 8.2 Mb Winchester hard disk \n\nAll the disks can be combined as follow: two 5.25\u0026quot; units + two 8\u0026quot; units + one hard disk, or, four 8\u0026quot; units and one hard disk. \n\nSome expansion options were available:\n- daisy-wheel (A-1200 \u0026amp; A-1250) and ink jet (A-1210) printers\n- memory expansion cards (128, 256, and 384 KB)\n- Intel 8087 math co-processor\n- real time clock\n- video card\n- expansion interfaces (RS232, parallel, communication and hard-disk) \n\nSeveral software packages were bundled or available separately: Canobrain (Canon database \u0026amp; data sheet), DBase II, Datastar, Infostar, Calcstar, Wordstar, Spellbinder, Spellstar, Wordmaster, and Gesmail.  Several different languages were available, as well: Assembler, GW Basic, Canobasic, Pascal UCSD, Fortran, and Cobol. \n\nThe AS-100 does not use any mouse but an innovative jog dialer (see picture). \n\n",
