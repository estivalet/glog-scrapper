  "description": "\nThe \u0026quot;TRS-80 Pocket Computer\u0026quot; was the first pocket computer Tandy/Radio Shack distributed. Nowadays, it is often referred to as the TRS-80 PC-1, so as to differentiate it from its successor, the TRS-80 PC-2 (and following), which is a clone of the Sharp PC-1500.\n\nThe TRS-80 Pocket Computer was custom manufactured by Sharp Corporation, and is technically identical with the Sharp PC-1211 (see there for more technical information). There were some minor differences: The colour style was a bit different, with gray and black prevailing instead of brown, and of course with a Radio Shack type label; moreover, the computer came with a soft (instead of hard) protective case, and an additional Quick Reference Card.\n\nThe peripherals were  - of course - the same as for the Sharp models: The cassette interface unit (Catalog Number 26-3503), and the printer and cassette interface (26-3505 ), which incorporated a single needle mechanical dot printer.\n\nSpecial thanks to Roman von Wartburg and his site for information and picture.\n \n\n\n",
