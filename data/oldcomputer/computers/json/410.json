  "description": "\nFor more than ten years, TEI has been a low profile manufacturer of electronic products for some of the largest OEM\u0027s in America. The company was vertically integrated, starting with raw materials and manufacturing all the parts needed for the end product.\nIn 1977, they started to produce a full line of computers based around the Intel 8080 microprocessor and CP/M operating system aimed at small business companies and liberal professions.\nThe PT-112 was the basic system of the PT series, Featuring 32 KB of RAM, a 24 x 80 display, a 5.25\u0026quot; 80 KB Shugart SA400 floppy drive and 5 available expansion slots.\nThe PT-212 was the same machine, with a 512 KB 8\u0026quot; Shugart SA800 floppy drive.\nThe PT-312 was sold with a dual 80 KB Floppy drive unit, and\nThe PT-412 with a dual 8\u0026quot; 512 KB unit.\n\nThe Terminal Processor family also included some versions, called PT-208 and PT-408 with a special case that provided 5.25\u0026quot; floppy drives housing on both sides of the screen.\n\nThanks to Wallace Berry for information and pictures\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",
