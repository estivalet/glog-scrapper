  "description": "\nTriumph was originally Triumph-Adler - the merger company of the 2 typewriter manufacturers Triumph and Adler, to which Triumph (which also produced mechanical calculators and sewing-machines) was the bigger one. Later they got US-typewriter Royal merged into it and had the best years between 1975 and 1988, when they even build competiting machines to IBM System /34 and /36 ... but they did neither understand nor learn the business and ran out of the financial power.\n\nThe technical part of TA is today a subsidary of Olivetti which tells it all about the downfall of TA. The operational part is a Holding in Nuremberg, which deals with offices, buildings and health-care.\n\nThe Alphatronic was mainly sold in Germany and was intended as a \u0027hybrid\u0027 Business / Home machine. For Business it was sold as either a \u0027dumb\u0027 Terminal or as a stand-alone Word Processor \u0027package\u0027 (consisting of base unit, WP Cartridge and (Centronics) printer.\n\nFor home the base unit had a \u0027built in\u0027 Basic ROM - it was also available with either a single or dual Floppy Disks (which included CP/M and Disk basic).\n\nIt never sold very well in either market - it was much too expensive for home use.\n\nThanks to its Z80 CPU, the Alphatronic PC can run CP/M and quite a few software packages available for it. There were two external disk-drives available: F1 and F2. F1 had the controller built-in. You had to have F1 to use F2, the second one.\n\nSometimes, the Alphatronic PC was sold as a complete wordprocessing package with a daisy-wheel printer (Triumph-Adler TR-170) and a word-processing cartridge inserted into the ROM-pack slot (top left part of the case).\n\nTowards the end of it\u0027s life, the British Company, MATMOS sold off the final \u0027batch\u0027 or single \u0026amp; dual floppy packages together with a RGB-PAL convertor\n box.\n\n___________\n\nContributors: Steeve Buniak\n \n\n\n",
