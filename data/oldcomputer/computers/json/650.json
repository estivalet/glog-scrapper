  "description": "\nRegnecentralen was a governmental agency founded in 1955 in order to build and run DASK (the first Danish computer), and for doing research in the computer field.\n\nThe RC 702 Piccolo (RC 700 was the series) was thus used by most schools in Denmark. It was equiped with a Z80A microprocessor, could be shipped with one or two built-in 5\u0026quot; floppy disc drive and ran CP/M.\n\nThe system supported CP/M and UCSD PASCAL, but was usually shipped with RC COMAL-80, a programming language which was used extensively in Danish schools for many years. COMAL was quite popular as a teaching language, especially in Scotland.\n\n\n________\n\nPictures \u0026amp; info from Henrik Schmidt\n \n\n\n",
