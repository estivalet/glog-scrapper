  "description": "\nDesigned by Barry Savage, the Menta looks like a Sinclair ZX-80 or ZX-81 clone, but it\u0027s not. It\u0027s rather a development tool and initiation machine based on a Z80A processor. The concept is to help you understand how a Z80A works.\n\nThe system itself is very similar to a Sinclair ZX-80 with its flat membrane keyboard. But when you look closer, you notice that the keybord is not quite usual like a QWERTY one for example. It\u0027s an hexadecimal one with numbers from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F. All the other keys are marked with Z80 machine language functions and instructions.\n\nApparently, there is no other language available than the built-in Z80 monitor. It enables you to directly program the Z80A microprocessor via the dedicated keyboard.\n\nThere is a RF TV video output to use any television as main display. A tape interface is here to save your work on magnetic tapes. There are even communication possibilities through a 24 i/o line connector.\n\nThe Menta is very rare and was only advertised in specialised magazines, next to EPROM programmers.\n\nIndeed the Menta is very similar to its brother: Softy, an E-PROM programmer which used the same plastic case, almost same keyboard and had an E-PROM socket at the left part of the keyboard.\n\n________\n\nContributors :  Callum\n \n\n\n",
