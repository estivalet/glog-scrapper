  "description": "\nThe BetaSystem was a S-100 BUS based system using a complete computer Z80 card that could handle two time-shared users. Up to nine cards could be installed in the case allowing up to 18 users / video terminals to be connected and used simultaneously.\n\nAs usual with S-100 based systems, a large range of storage devices could be added to the system: 5.25\u0026quot;, 8\u0026quot; or 14\u0026quot; Winchester disk drives from 5 MB to 600 MB, 5.25\u0026quot; or 8\u0026quot; floppies, and tape cartridges up to 100 MB.\n\nMainly based on the UCSD PASCAL operating system, the BetaSystem could also be used with CP/M and TurboDos O.S.\n \n\n\n",

In fact, the 36 Mhz speed is obtained by adding the speed of the 9 x Z80 cards installed into the system. The maximum system speed was in fact 4 Mhz.\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
