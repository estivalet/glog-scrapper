  "description": "\nThis computer had an integrated dot printer which can print on 40 to 132 columns at 120 cps, a 12\u0026quot; color graphic monitor and a dual 5\u0026quot; disc drives. A lot of cards were designed to be placed into the three expansion slots: an 8\u0026quot; disk controler, centronics interface, IEEE488 port, ADC/DAC card or ram expansion (64 or 128 KB).\n\nA bit of trivia: the video card has its own Z80 CPU.\n\nApparently this computer was marketed by BMC outside Japan.\n\nAlexander Velin says :\nThere is OKI if 800 model 50, which is based on 8086, has 256 KB ram, spare keyboard, one 8\u0026quot; 560 KB floppy, 7 MB HDD. Mine has a MS DOS 1.15 on it...\n\nMore technical information from Bruce Grant:\nI serviced IF-800\u0027s in the early 1980\u0027s.\nThe printer was a 7 pin matrix mechanically related to the Oki Microline 82 but largely software driven. It was a frightful device.\nBoth colour and monochrome screens were offered, and were excellent. The colour monitor had, as I recall, three seperate banks of 16K of RAM, one for each of the primary colours, providing an early form of 24-bit colour. Power for the main unit was provided through the monitor. Two people were needed to safely carry the colour monitor.\nThe floppy disks were made by YE-Data and offered good capacity for the time - in the order of 500KB. They were of the solenoid head loading type and were ponderously slow but generally quite reliable.\nCP/M 2.2 and a standalone version of MS-Basic were supplied. Each system used its own disk format. Sadly, these were not interchangeable. Bitmapped graphics were implemented through the MS-Basic system only, as were the bezel-mounted screen \u0026quot;hotkeys\u0026quot;.\nThe IF-800 was crippled commercially by appearing on the market at the same time as the IBM PC-XT, which cost slightly less as I recall.\nThey were distributed in Canada by Canada Computer of Markham, Ontario.\n\n\n \n\n\n",
