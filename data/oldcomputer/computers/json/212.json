  "description": "\nThe Sord M23 Mark III was available with 12\u0026quot; green monitor or a 14\u0026quot; color monitor.\n\nDespite the M23 featured a cartridge port, all of its important software came on floppies, including the ground-breaking PIPS-III and several BASIC compiler variants developed by Sord and running on their own OS. A lot of good business software and games were written with these.\n\nThere were later Mark systems released, including a Mark I with the world\u0027s first 3.5 inch floppies deployed, and the Mark V with eight inch drives -- the Mark III had 5.25\u0027\u0027 floppies. There was also the Mark X with a 10MB hard drive.\n\nAround 1983 or so the \u0026quot;M23EX\u0026quot; was released - this was basically an M23 with the mk41 drives (5.25\u0026quot; DSHD) housed in an M68 case (more PC-style with separate keyboard and floppies in the main case).  It was a low cost option contemporary with the more expensive and better spec\u0027d M68.\n\nGraphics required an upgrade - from memory it was a chip, and also an upgrade from \u0026quot;FDOS\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;GDOS\u0026quot; (the graphics DOS).  Graphics on this and the M68 were operated in a weird way from CBASIC or BASIC-II (a structured BASIC) - you put it into graphics mode and then issued specially formatted PRINT commands to access graphics - for example:\n\n10 PRINT CLEAR\n20 GRAPH 1\n30 PRINT \u0026quot;GINIT\u0026quot;\n40 PRINT \u0026quot;COLOR 7\u0026quot;\n... other code ....\n50 GRAPH 0\n\n________\n\nContributors: Andrew Joll\n \n\n\n",
