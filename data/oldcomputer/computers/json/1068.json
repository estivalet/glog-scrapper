  "description": "\nThe all-in-one HP 9826 computer was the successor of the 9825.  It was the transition machine between the calculators/computers 9800 family and the HP-9000-200 desktop computer series. As it belonged to both the families, it was also called HP 9000-236\n\nIt was a robust and compact 6800-based machine which featured a 7\u0026quot; monochrome display, a complete keyboard (including first use of soft-keys and the scroll wheel at leftand), a 264 KB, 5.25\u0026quot; floppy-disk drive. On the rear panel, one also found one HP-IB port and 8 expansion slots.\n\nLike the 9825, it ran HPL, but could also run BASIC and Pascal. The Basic interpreter was developped by HP and was also known as \u0026quot;Rocky Mountain BASIC\u0026quot;, or RMB. This version would evolve into the HP-BASIC for the series-300 and HP-UX machines.\n\nThe 9826 was choosen and intensively used by the Walt Disney studios for \u0026quot;Tron\u0026quot;, the first movie that used a computer to control all the processes implemented during the shoot, from camera adjustments to graphic and text superimpositions.\n \n\n\n",
