  "description": "\nThe Visual 1050.  Entered into the PC battles mid-80s from the now defunct\nVisual Technology company (most famous for video terminals at the time).\n\nThis CP/M based machine was tailored to Wordstar with a specialized\nkeyboard featuring all the wordstar function keys.\nGraphic capabilities were managed by a second 6502 processor.\n\nIt was delivered with a set of Digital Research software, including CP/M, C-BASIC compiler, DR-GSX (graphic extensions), as well as WordStar (Word processor), Mailmerge (address database), Multiplan (spreadsheet) and TTY-1050 (communications)\n\nJohn Citron remembers:\nI worked for Visual from 1980-1987. From 1983 to 1987, I was a hardware technician with them and serviced many of these machines. In addition to the expansion ports on the outside, there is also a riser header for a, never implemented, optional memory expansion card. The 9\u0026quot; green monitor was manufactured in Taiwan by ADI and it, along with the keyboard, eventually became the main components for their V-50/55 and V-60/65 line of video terminals.\n\nIn addition to coming with a huge bundle of applications, the system was also able to read CP/M disks from many of the competitive machines in its day. By running a special utility, one could load in programs and data from Osborne, DEC VT-180, DEC Rainbow, and others.\n\nOverall, the system was great in its day and I eventually owned one for a number of years. The video was crisp and the Keytronic keyboard was comfortable to use. The only complaint that I ever had was the noise. The system was very loud due to the empty case and the noisy fan and floppy drives.\n\nThanks to Richard Bramante for information and pictures.\n\n\n \n\n\n",
