  "description": "\nThe MBC-1000 was the bottom-of-the-range system of a series of \u0026quot;Creative Computer\u0026quot; CP/M machines which was also comprised of the 11xx and 12xx ranges.\n\nAlthough its design wasn\u0027t revolutionary, it was a well-built and reliable machine featuring a detachable keyboard, a 12-inch green monochrome screen and a single built-in 5.25, 327 KB floppy drive.\n\nIt ran CP/M 2.2 OS with a very fast boot up sequence. The OS was ready to run in less than five seconds after the machine was switched on. The whole family of Micropro software - WordStar, CalcStar, DataStar, ReportStar... was specially modified to fit MBC-1000 features. Sbasic, an extended Basic interpreter, was included into the CP/M master diskette. \n\nSanyo CP/M machines had a discreet life in business world and were gradually replaced by PC compatible systems.\n\nExtracts from the marketing brochure:\n\n\n- Compact design integrating all the functions for multi-purpose applications\n- Z-80A CPU ensures high-speed processing with no-wait mode\n- A substantial library of business software has been developed in the United States to Sanyo\u0027s specifications. Sanyo will also offer word-processing, electronic spread-sheets, and related software to its distributor and dealer network. A user encyclopedia for the extensive, powerful SBASIC II is supplied with the machine. The Sanyo computer will support all CP/M compatible software and along with the appropriate interpreter or compiler, programs can be run in C-Basic, M-Basic, Fortran, Cobol, Forth and others. Sanyo will support and publish a list of approved software products to its dealers, distributors and end users.\n- SBASIC II adds several additional commands and statements to those featured by Microsoft BASIC. The disket supplied includes a set of Check programs and Utilities allowing extra programming flexibility.\n- Built-in floppy disk drive with file copy procedure can be expanded to incorporate up to three 5\u0026quot;1/4 or two 8\u0026quot; additional floppy disk drives. The expandability to over 2.3 MB of disk storage assures the capacity to meet your needs.\n- Easy-to-operate typewriter-style keyboard with numeric pad and five function keys for easy program execution\n- 12\u0026quot; non-glare green phosphor video display screen showing up to 256 standard and graphic characters. For special graphic or alpha-numeric needs, programmable character generator allows you to change any character to meet these requirements.\n- Centronics parallel printer port, RS-232C serial port, and additional 5\u0026quot;1/4 floppy expansion disk port are standard.\n- Additional interface cards are available for a parallel port or RS-232 port.\n- The interface card for the EFD860F (additional 8\u0026quot; external drives) is packaged with the EFD860F\n\n \n\n\n",

I bought a package that included an MBC-1000, second external 5 1/4 floppy drive, daisy wheel printer, installation and something like 8 hours of instruction for around $4,000  (1983 or 4?). I would guess the retail price of just the computer as pictured was around $2,000. We used CalcStar for our costings and WordStar for letters and stuff like that.    In June 2006, I dismantled all the parts and took it to the recycle center, along with my Kaypro which replaced it. Heavy steel construction, very little plastic.      I still have my custom boot disk and WordStar program disk, just to impress other old timers !\u0026quot;\u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to Chris Collman for this picture\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
