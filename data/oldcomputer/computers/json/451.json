The Model 2x was the successor of the ABC 10, which had a digital tape auxillary memory, supplied with DOSKET-T. \n \nA lot of languages were developed for these computers: \n- Dosket : Fortran IV, Basic, Cobol, Macro Assembler.\n- CP/M : MBasic, CBasic, Pascal, Cobol 80, Fortran 80, PL/3, etc.\n\n(AI DOSKET is the AI Electronics Operating System.)\n \n\n\n",
