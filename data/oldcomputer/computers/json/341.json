  "description": "\nNearly nothing is known about this obscure system. Help welcome !\n\n_____________\n\nPat from Australia, remembers:\nOn a whim, I looked up the Hitachi S1. When I was much younger - probably in 1984 or 1985 - my dad worked as a Hitachi reseller in Australia. The S1 was not sold outside of Japan to my knowledge, but it did have English available as a language so that may not be for certain. What really caught my attention outside of the amazing computational capabilities and colours (having used Hitachi Peaches for quite a while) was that the S1 (or at least the one I was playing with) had a hard disk! If only I could remember the name of the games I was playing on this thing!\n \n\n\n",
