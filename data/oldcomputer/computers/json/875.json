  "description": "\nOn December 1975, the coveted inside-front-cover of Byte magazine contained a two-page advertisement for \u0026quot;the world\u0027s lowest cost computer system\u0026quot;. This was perhaps the first non-MOS Technology 6502 based computer system to come to market, behind only the TIM and possibly KIM-1. The computer was named Jolt, and it was marketed by Microcomputer Associates Inc. as both a kit for $249, or fully assembled and tested for $348 (Dec. 1975 Byte).\n\nMicrocomputer Associates also sold add-ons for the basic system. They included 4 kilobytes for $265, an I/O card for $96, and a power supply for $145.\n\nThe Jolt is somewhat famous for the part it played in the development of the prototype Atari 2600 VCS, which was assembled using the Jolt computer board.\n\nJolt was designed and developed by Raymond M. Holt, Founder and Executive Vice-President of Microcomputer Associates. Holt went on to design the SYM-1 single-board computer, a KIM-1 clone. In the late 1990\u0027s Holt was finally given government permission to discuss his role in the development of the F-14 Tomcat. Holt claims he designed and developed the worlds first microprocessor one year before Intel.\n\nManny Lemas was the co-founder of Microcomputer Associates, Inc. Ray Holt was the hardware side and he was the software side of the business. He wrote the DEMON (Debugger/Monitor) software for the JOLT.\nThis software was actually developed for MOS Technology for use in the\nTIM chip and the KIM-1 single board computer.  M.A. was granted rights to\nits own version of the software for use in the JOLT.\n\nPart of text and picture provided by Brian Bagnall.\n \n\n\n",

Whether your needs as a user ore for personal programming, games playing, scientific or process control, educational or business use the MTX Series is already capable or very easily adoptable to almost every application. Glance through the standard features below - you\u0027ll see what we mean.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Software\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The MTX\u0027s 24K ROM contains several languages and routines which enable the novice or the experienced programmer to make full use of the machine. Standard languages are MTX BASIC, MTX LOGO commands, NODDY. ROM routines include on ASSSEMBLER/DISASSEMBLER with screen display of the Z80 CPU registers, memory and program, which can be manipulated from the keyboard. Machine code programs can be stepped through one instruction at a time, and easily called from within BASIC programs. A further feature is the Virtual Screen facility which enables the programmer to split the screen into a maximum of eight sections to work independently whilst maIntaining all full screen facilities. Pascal is available as on add-on ROM pock.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Hardware - 32K RAM on the MTX500. 64K on the MTX512.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The MTX500 has 32K of user RAM as standard (64K on the 512), expandable to 512K plus 16K of video RAM, controlled by a separate Video Processor. Sixteen colours, 40 column text, 256 x 192 high resolution graphics with all sixteen colours available, and 32 easily moveable user defined graphics characters (Sprites) combine to make effective screen displays quick and simple to achieve. Standard outputs are centronics printer port, two ioystick ports, an uncommitted I/O port, 2400 Baud Cassette port, separate TV and Video Monitor ports, 4 channel sound with hifi output plus a dedicated cartridge port. Other standard features include the Z80A processor runnIng at 4MHz, real time clock, full moving key keyboard with 79 keys including eight 2-function keys and separate numeric pad.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The Disc Based Computers from Memotech.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Designed to use the full power of the MTX computers the FDX and HDX make perfect busIness systems at prices which make perfect business sense.
