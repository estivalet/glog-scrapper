  "description": "\nThe model 820-II is basically a model 820 with a higher clock rate (4 MHz instead of 2.5 MHz) and a 8\u0026quot; double density/double side disk-drive and hard-disk instead of the the two basic 8\u0026quot; Single density/single side disk-drive of the first model 820. But the hard-disk is said to be very noisy and the dual disks weigh more than 38 pounds!\n\nNearly all the hardware is housed within the monitor, a bit like a Macintosh. The separate keyboard is linked to the monitor by a \u0026quot;not-long-enough\u0026quot; cord. The 8\u0026quot; disk-drive and hard-disk are mounted in a separate huge box. The 10MB hard drive for example was boxed with an 8\u0026quot; drive. A real-time clock is included in the hardware. Green screens were available in all models since the screen/processor case was common to all.\n\nLike its predecessor, the 820-II is well furnished in software of all sorts. Thanks to its CP/M compatibility nearly every profession can find a suitable program. A lot of languages and OS were also available (CP/M, Basic 80, C Basic 2, Assembler Macro 80, Cobol 80, Short 80, TTY communication, 3270/3780 emulation).\nBut the 820-II has no real graphic possibilities nor sound, and a small RAM capacity (64 KB) for a professional computer. Above all it was quite expensive compared to its competitors.\n\nThere was also WP dedicated versions with unique key caps.\n\nA 16-bit expansion board was released to upgrade the 820-II, so that its performance would nearly match the new Xerox computer(the 16/8), and also allowed the 820 to work under DOS. At the start of the year 1985, Xerox would definately leave the micro-computer market and stop the production of the 820.\n\n___________\n\nContributors: Jeremy Wilcox, Bronislaw Opacki Jr\n\nDale Carpenter clarifies:\nI started working for Xerox in 1983 as a PC tech in the Xerox Service Center a sevice/support part to the retail store they had back then.\n820-II\u0027s were the next step after 820\u0027s they were already double density instead of upgraded like many 820\u0027s were. They also supported double sided drives.\nThe drive choices were 5.25\u0026quot; dual drives single or double sided, 8\u0026quot; dual drives also single or double sided and the top was a 8\u0026quot;double sided floppy paired with a 8\u0026quot; 10Mb Shugart hard drive.The 8\u0026quot; double density, 2-sided floppies had a capacity of 960K which was a lot for back then.\n\n\n \n\n\n",
