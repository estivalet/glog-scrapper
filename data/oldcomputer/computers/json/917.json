  "description": "\nThis page is dedicated to Toshiba range of PC compatible laptop computers. \nThe T1200 is first described model. More models will come soon (see \u0027Read more\u0027 section).\n\nT0SHIBA T-1200\nThe Toshiba T1200 was a very advanced laptop for it?s time, being able to run many powerful programs only a proper PC could use at the time. It has an 8 Inch screen that can only use scales of Green and Blue.\n\nAnother Feature was the first ?Resume? Feature, kind of like suspend or Standby on today?s computers. This laptop was the first ever to use this feature.\nIt outclassed the other laptops, like the Datavue spark because of it?s competitive price and lower weight. The buyer could choose between a standard and backlit LCD Screen.\n\nTheir were 2 Main Models available at the time, 1 With two 720K 3 ? Floppy Drives (T 1200FB) and the other one with 1 720K 3 ? Floppy and a 20MB Hard Drive (T 1200HB). It came with an official MS-DOS 3.3 floppy disk or with MS-DOS loaded onto the hard drive for hard disc versions.\n\nRAM above 640 KB can be used as a fast, battery-backed RAM disk drive (Toshiba Hard RAM) and / or expanded memory (LIM-EMS).\n\nAnother popular feature was that some models came with an internal 1200 Baud Modem, the first of its kind in most computers.\n\n_______________________",
