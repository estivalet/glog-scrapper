  "description": "\nAfter NeXT abandoned the hardware business,Canon (who had a large investment in NeXT) bought the licence and started producing the successor to the NeXTstation. \n\nThe Object Station was an Intel-based PC specifically adapted to run the NEXTSTEP O/S. There were two versions available, the 31 and the 41, with IDE \u0026amp; SCSI being the main difference. There are also specs for a Pentium-based 51 but it remains unclear whether it actually came to market. \n\nThe computer could also run Windows and other PC operating systems.\nIt came with a keyboard, that had the NeXT-specific keys found on NeXT keyboards and accompanied by a 17\u0026quot; or 21\u0026quot; monitor (made by Hitachi). NEXTSTEP 3.3 O/S was pre-installed. \n\nThe Object Station did not sell very well (possibly due to marketing and Canon having other plans than being a PC manufacturer) and thus was very short lived, making it a very hard to find item. \n \n\n\n",

The chassis also provides a 12-slot S-100 mother board which contains a Real-Time Interrupt, two RS-232C serial ports, one 8-bit parallel port and power regulation circuitry for the integrated floppy disk drives. Either a 115 or 230 volt power supply with sufficient power for all 12 slots and the disk drives is also included. The use of high speed (200 nsec) Dynamic RAM and \u0026quot;fast stepping\u0026quot; floppy disk drives, along with the 4 MHz CPU, delivers the highest average performance of all comparable microcomputers as measured by independent benchmark studies! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;SOFTWARE\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The power and versatility of the HORIZON computer is further enhanced by a wide range of system and application software. For business use, the comprehensive North Star Application Software Packages offer Word Processing, Accounting and Financial Reporting in either single user or multi-user versions. For the scientific, engineering, or education oriented user, North Star\u0027s powerful DOS operating system with its efficient BASIC or Pascal languages are available. The industry standard CP/M operating system is also compatible with applications packages in MicroSoft BASIC, FORTRAN, and COBOL.\u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Gordon Dyer\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; from England\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
