  "description": "\nIn 1986, the 900th Anniversary of the Norman Domesday Book, the BBC and \nthe National Curriculum, amongst other UK bodies, endeavoured to \nproduced a 20th Century equivalent. Recently the Domesday project has \nhad renewed interest, as the sense of producing such an ambitious \nundertaking then storing the results on a strange, and now forgotten, \nformat has been called into question many times since!\n\nFor old-computers.com readers, the interesting bits are not terribly \ninteresting - but they are scarce. The presentation was viewable on one \nof two platforms - the main, and the one most associated with it, was \nthe BBC Master AIV (Advanced Interactive Video). This isn\u0027t an \n\u0027official\u0027 term - as far as Acorn and the BBC were concerned, they \nwanted schools to purchase the system in the belief that it was \nessentially what they were used to. The BBC Master was an off the shelf \nMaster Turbo, with an additional SCSI interface (possibly \nelectronically derived from the SCSI interface built into the ACW), and \nan additional filing system to access the LV-ROM.\n\nThe VP415 LV-ROM was an industrial Philips Laservision player, already \n\u0027programmable\u0027 according to the Laservision standards. The storage was \nbroken down into volumes, with data encoded along with the video \ncontent (which can be played separately). The SCSI interface allowed \ndata retrieval but this was also possible via the RS-232 interface - \nand a module to allow the other machine popular in schools at the time \naccess - the RM Nimbus. The actual data format on the disc was \ncontrolled by LV-DOS in the player, and VFS in the BBC series computer. \nWhilst the Master AIV was most definitely marketed for this \napplication, the documentation is quite vague about whether a BBC B \ncould be used, implying that merely the VFS ROM is required!\n\nVideo from the laserdisc was mixed using a genlock incorporated in the \nbase of the VP415 with data generated by the Domesday applications and \ndisplayed on a SCART monitor.\n\nApplications allowed searching of film content, further exploration of \nthe information, such as going into a house pictured (within \nlimitations, of course!), and statistical analysis of data gathered in \na project that involved schools all over the UK. It\u0027s quite likely that \nmany people of my generation contributed, in some small part, to the \nDomesday project.\n\nAdditional discs were produced for educational purposes, hoping to \nexpand the applications of the AIV system, but the late 80s was to see \nthe advent of Microsoft\u0027s \u0026quot;Multimedia PC\u0026quot; standard, Philips\u0027 own CDi, \nand many other CD (rather than LD) based systems. LV-ROM, in addition \nto the video and still frames, could store just under 400Mb of data on \na 12\u0026quot; optical disc - whilst the video would take up more space on CD, \nthe media was physically fragile and was eventually to be rendered \nobsolete with the end of the VP415.\n\nProjects to restore the Domesday project are hampered by copyright law \nand the restrictions of accessing the data, The most successful is \nLeeds University\u0027s CAMeLION project, an emulated system, with some \nPC-based applications. I am undertaking my own \u0027accessible\u0027 project, to \nattempt to make the material useable in a wide range of consumer \nfriendly appliances, but like everyone else, am tied by the fragility \nof the hardware (if anyone has parts for the VP415 I need spares!) and \nof course, copyright law.\n\n___________\n\nThanks A LOT to Richard Kilpatrick for all this info.\n\n \n\n\n",
