  "description": "\nThe IASIS ia-7301, also called \u0027Computer in a Book\u0027 is a training computer, based on the Intel 8080 microprocessor. It was delivered with a 250 pages programming course (contained in a 3-ring binder), but without any power supply. User had to buy it as an option !\n\nBasic version offered 1 Kb of ROM holding the monitor, 1 Kb of RAM and two I/O ports. Programs were saved through a standard tape recorder. An optional expander board allowed to add standard cards (S100 bus ?) to increase memory size and connect various extension cards (Teletype, TV, keyboard, I/O).\n \n\n\n",
