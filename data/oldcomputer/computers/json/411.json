  "description": "\nThe Mini PM/4T was the multi-user version of the Televideo PC compatible. A video terminal was used for interfacing directly to the system.\n\nThe InfoShare Operating System can run many multi-user programs or execute most single-user MS-DOS programs.\n\nThe PM/4T can be linked to up to four computers (PCs or Televideo\u0027s PM Workstation [a terminal]).\n\nIt was sold for $6000, and a 16-user version was available at $9000.\nA $99 card was required to connect each PC to the system.\n\nIgor Pronin reports :\nI was one of the first users in Finland. Infoshare Operating System was actually Novell Netware. In the begining it was version 1 or 1.1 but it was soon upgraded to 1.2. As a server running programs off the server, it was faster than from a local hard disk of a 12 MHz AT.\n \n\n\n",
