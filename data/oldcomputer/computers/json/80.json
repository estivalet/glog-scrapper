  "description": "\nThe Acorn Atom was the ancestor of the BBC computers series. It was sold in kit or ready-assembled versions.\n\nThe great advantage of the Atom compared to its competitors (TRS-80 \u0026amp; PET), was its high resolution capabilities (256 x 192) which were quite unusual in 1979 for the price. \n\nThe built-in BASIC was in some ways quite limited (it could only use integers for example) but an optional 4K ROM added the ability to use floating point numbers, trigonometric functions, to convert degrees/radians and to draw graphics in color. More add-ons were also available enabling autonumbering, a faster cassette interface (1200 bauds), and functions such as INKEY$, MID$, READ, DATA, FILL, etc...\nThere was even a BBC BASIC board available. \n\nA lot of applications were available on sideways ROMs that plugged into the \u0026quot;utility ROM socket\u0026quot; as Acorn called it, such as the \u0026quot;Atom Word Pack ROM\u0026quot; (word processing) or Atom-Calc (a 4K ROM spreadsheet).\n\nA colour card was available, connected to the BUS connector, it provided 8 colors, 4 simultaneously at the 64 x 192 resolution or 2 at 128 x 192 for example. But it was known to overheat! \n\nA lot of other peripherals were developed :\n- a 5.25\u0026quot; floppy disk drive (100K) which held the DOS in a 3K ROM but cost about twice as much as a new Atom!,\n- a digital-tape recorder,\n- a printer interface,\n- a network card called EcoNet which enabled linking of up to 250 Atoms (210 K/Bauds transfer rate),\n- RAM expansions,\n- etc...\n\n_________\n\nMr Wobbler reports :\nThe overheating of the graphics card seemed due to the conversion from NTSC to PAL. THE VC chip could be just seen under the mountain of discrete components to convert the scan rate... Programming the atom was fun, allowing the mixing of in-line assembler code embedded in basic programs.  This made the transition from high level to assembler programming easier. My father bought one and had 2 subsequent replacements  supplied FOC by Acorn due to problems in the video circuitry (mostly the output frequency wandering). \n\nPeter Passchier comments:\nThe speaker was not just a beeper. You have direct write access to the I/O port, and it could be made to beep at a particular pitch by \u0027toggling\u0027 the speaker at a particular frequency. I used to use a one-liner that I would type in manually at night to wake me up with a warble at a desired time in the morning!\n \n\n\n",

Simple-to-build, simple-to-operate. But a really powerful full-facility computer. And designed on an expandable basis. You can buy a superb expanded package now-tailored to your needs. Or, you can buy just the standard Atom kit, and, as you grow in confidence and knowledge, add more chips. No need to replace your equipment. No need to worry that your investment will be overtaken by new technology.

You can see from the specifications that the RAM can be increased to 12K allowing high resolution (256 x 192) graphics. Two further ROM chips, e.g. maths functions, can be added directly to the board giving a 16K capacity. In addition to 5 I/O lines partly used by the cassette interface, an optional VIA device can provide varied I/O and timer functions and via a buffer device allow direct printer drive. An optional module provides red, green and blue signals for colour. An in-board connector strip takes the ATOM communications loop interface. Any number of ATOMs may be tinked to each other - or to a master system with mass storage, hard copy facility. Interface with other ACORN cards is simplicity itself. Anyone ACORN card may be fitted internally. So you can see there are a vast number of modular options and additions available, expanding with your ability and your budget.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM hardware includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Memory from 2K to 12K RAM on board (up to 35K in case)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .8K to 16K ROM (two 4K additions) 86502 processor\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Video Display allows high resolution (256 x 192) graphics and red, green and blue output\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Cassette Interface-CUTS 300 baud\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Loudspeaker allows tone generation of any frequency\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Channel36 UHF Modulator Output .Bus output includes internal connections for Acorn Eurocard.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM software includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .32-bit arithmetic (+/- 2,000,000,000)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .High speed execution\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .43 standard/extended BASIC commands \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Variable length strings (up to 256 characters)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .String manipulation functions\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 32-bit integer variables\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 additional arrays\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .random number function .PUT and GET byte\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .WAIT command for timing\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .DO-UNTIL construction\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Logical operators (AND, OR, EX-OR)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .LINK to machine-code routines\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Plot draw and move. \u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Paul Durrant\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
