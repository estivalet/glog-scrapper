  "description": "\n\u0026quot;When the NewBrain was announced to the world, in 1980, the design concept was significantly in advance of anything that had been seen in the field of handheld computing.\u0026quot; (Dick Pountain - Personal Computer World)\n\nIn fact, the company that created it, Newburry Labs, sold the desing to its current owner, Grundy Business Systems Ltd.\nIt also seems that a small part of the original design came from Sinclair Radionics which designed later the ZX-80.\n\nAt one time, the NewBrain was in line to be the BBC computer, but design problems and the change in ownership caused the BBC to look elsewhere.\n\nIn 1982, the machine was advertised as a compact but powerful microcomputer with advanced hardware and software features.\n\nThe NewBrain AD, which contains a 1-line, 16-character fluorescent display, was complemented by a no-display cheaper version sold ?30 less, the NewBrain A. There was no reset button and no ON/OFF switch either. A third model, called Newbrain M included a battery-backup option (and the LCD screen) so it can be used as a handheld computer.\n\nAn expansion interface was available, providing 2 serial ports, 2 parallels, 1 DAC, 1 joystick port, and a light pen port.\nA network was also available and allowed to connect 24 computers together through RS-232/V24 bidirectional serial ports.\nThe New Brain used a special management memory system which allows to expand memory up to 2 Mb (IMPRESSIVE!).\nThe character set contained 512 letters, numbers and graphics as well as VideoText symbols. The Character set was divided into two 256-character banks, only one of which could be selected at a time.\nAn optional VideoText module enabled NewBrains owners to access British TeleText and Prestel services\nIt could run under CP/M. \n\n \n\n\n",
