  "description": "\nThis professional computer was compatible with most of the hardware and software designed for the Apple II.\n\nIt could run under DOS 3.x, but thanks to its second CPU, a Z80 processor, it could also run under CP/M.\n\nThe Basis 108 had 128 KB RAM, (two switchable memory banks of 64k).\n\nTwo 5\u0026quot;1/4 disk-drives (Apple compatible) could also be mounted inside the computer. In the picture, these are Apple Disk II drives.\n\nThe Basis 108 was a good Apple II compatible machine with a lot of options built-in (80 columns, disk-drives controller, CP/M, high-resolution graphics), and was cheaper than the equivalent Apple system...\n\nA year after introduction, the Basis Junior was presented at various different electronic shows. It was basically the same computer but with only 64 KB RAM (with optional expansion to 128k).\n \n\n\n",
