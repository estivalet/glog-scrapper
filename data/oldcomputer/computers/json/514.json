  "description": "\nThis big computer was a wordprocessor system and had everything built-in: monitor, disk-drives and printer.\n\nThe printer, mounted on top of the case, could print 30 characters per second.\n\nThe wordprocessor software enabled to define tabulations, paragraphs and left/right margins. All kind of editing functions were available : delete, insert and replace characters, words, lines or paragraphs. Underlining, automatic central adjustment, tables with horizontal and vertical lines were also possible...\n\nSeveral texts could be easily merged into one file. The system automatically indexed the files in alphabetical order (wow!).\n\nAnother feature of the Alpha Plus was its ability to be connected to a database system.\n\nThanks to Michel Fidder for the pictures.\n \n\n\n",
