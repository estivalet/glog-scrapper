  "description": "\nThe G4 computer represents the real entry of the S.M.T. Goupil company in the professional computers world. The time of the craft period with systems intended for a small circle of computers hobbyists and teachers is over. With the G4, the french manufacturer clearly affirms his will to quickly penetrate the companies and administrations market.\n\nThe future will show that this new positioning will be successfull, partly thanks to the qualities of the G4 : modern and fast microprocessor, full compatibility with IBM standard, but also thanks to a dynamic and coherent european marketing policy.\n \n\n\n",
