  "description": "\nIn 1947, Maston Beard and Trevor Pearcey led a research group at the Sydney-based Radiophysics Laboratory of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research [known as CSIRO* today], to design and build the first Australian  electronic computer. \n\nThe resources they had available included the vacuum tube or \u0026quot;valve\u0026quot; technology and the pulse techniques developed for radar systems during World War II. Their developments paralleled, but were to a considerable extent independent of computer developments in Europe and the USA. \n\nThe CSIR Mk1 ran its first test programs in late 1949  and it was the fifth electronic stored program computer ever developed. It embodied many features novel at the time and was able to operate more than 1000 times faster than the best mechanical calculators. The machine was officially opened in 1951 and used to solve problems both for the Radiophysics Laboratory and outside organisations. It was decommissioned in 1955 and shipped to Melbourne. \n\nOn 14 June 1956 the Mk1 was recommissioned and renamed CSIRAC and the new Computation Laboratory at the University of Melbourne was officially opened. It was in Melbourne that CSIRAC came into its own as a general computing workhorse - from June 1956 to June 1964 over 700 computing projects were processed. \n\nIn November 1964, Dr. Frank Hirst switched CSIRAC off for the last time and donated it to the Museum of Victoria. It is now at the Melbourne Museum, and was modified to blink its lights on and off for the exhibition, although it isn\u0027t actually turned on.\n\nInformation taken from the detailed page of the University of Melbourne dedicated to the CSIRAC computer.\n\n\n \n\n\n",

It can be configured to match most any system need.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; MITS\u0027 plug-In compatible boards for the Altair 8800b now include: 4K static memory. 4K dynamic memory, 16K static memory, multi-port serial interface, multi-port parallel interface, audio cassette record interface, vectored interrupt, real time clock, PROM board, multiplexer, AID convertor, extender card, disc controller and line printer interface.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; MITS\u0027 peripherals for the Altair 8800b include the Altair Floppy Disc, Altair Line Printer, teletypewriters, and the soon-to-be-announced Altair CRT terminal. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Introductory prices for the Altair 8800b are $840 for a kit with complete assembly instructions, and $1100 for an assembled unit. Complete documentation, membership into the Altair Users Club, subscription to \u0026quot;Computer Notes\u0026quot;, access to the Altair Software Library, and a copy of Charles J. Sippi\u0027s Microcomputer Dictionary are included.\u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Murray Moffatt\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; from New Zealand \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
