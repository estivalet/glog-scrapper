  "description": "\nIn the very late 1960\u0027s, 2 professors at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio came up with the idea of a high density integrated circuit which would be\nprogrammable. Its purpose would be to a programmable/adaptable physical\ninterface. They took this circuit design to various IC manufacturers and were\nturned down by all of the existing IC manufacturers. The reason? The chip was\ntoo specialized and would never have enough widespread applicability to be\nfinancially worth developing. \n\nHaving failed to convince any IC manufacturers, but still believing in the concept these 2 professors pressed on and went looking for manufacturers who would have an application for the new chip. They found such a firm in Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC), which made a variety of lower cost computer terminals which were compatible with the various computer companies. CTC was interested in the chip because it presented a way to make one terminal that could be programmed to behave like and handle the protocols of a variety of different computer manufacturers. [This was the days of Snow White (IBM) and the seven dwarfs: Sperry, Burroughs, Honeywell, GE, Control Data Corporation....]  CTC agreed to pay two different chip makers to produce the chip. Both chip makers decided to use a new technology, called PMOS, to produce the chip. CTC agreed to the use of the new technology, but was concerned about speed to market, so they set a time limit on the chip delivery.  Skip ahead a year or so.\n\nBoth chip makers have encountered new technology problems with PMOS and have failed to meet the CTC deadline.  So the contracts are canceled and CTC builds the chip via discrete TTL logic and puts it into a programmable desktop terminal\ncalled the Datapoint 2200.\n\nOne of the chip makers, Texas Instruments, shelves the project. The other chip\nmaker determines that they are approximately 85% complete on the project and\nthat while the project will never break even, it will cost less to finish the\nchip, put it on the market and recover some of the costs. They do this and\nabout a year later, a bell goes off in the financial department. The chip,\ncalled an Intel 8008, has broken even and is now making a profit. So the chip\nmanufacturer, Intel, goes on a field trip to visit customers who are buying the\nchip, to find out what it is being used for. In so doing, the customers have\nlots of suggestions on ways to improve the chip, which Intel does and thus the\nIntel 8080 is born.\n\nIn the meantime, back at CTC, they have introduced the Datapoint 2200 to the\nmarket. It becomes an extremely successful product. So much so, that CTC\nchanges it\u0027s name to Datapoint Corporation. They go on to invent another new\ntechnology to connect all of their low cost computers together. It was called\na Local Area Network (LAN) and was the most popular LAN until around 1980.\nWhile the initial Datapoint 2200 did not have a microprocessor in it, it had\nthe programmable equivalent of an Intel 8008 and it funded the initial\ndevelopment of the first microprocessor. Thus it is the first microprocessor\nbased computer.\n\nThe Datapoint 2200 had a small built in CRT screen, keyboard and 2 cassette\ndecks. There was a run light and 2 other lights on the keyboard. When the\nmachine halted, you could not tell where in the program it had done so. So you\nput in the O/S cassette and rebooted. You then did a memory dump and tried to\ndeduce what had went wrong. Primitive by today\u0027s standards, it was the first\ncomputer on a desktop.\n\nThere were also an optional disk drive using Shugart 8\u0026quot; floppies, single-sided, single-density. It was the first commercial computer to include them! Languages included Databus and Datashare (\u0026quot;COBOL-like\u0026quot; business computer languages, interpreted to allow multiple 80 character by 24 row dumb CRTs to share tiny partitions of RAM memory in the main system unit), a Basic interpreter, and RPG II compiler.\n\nDatapoint is still in business, but is only a small fraction of their size in the mid 1970\u0027s\n\nThanks to Tom Meserole for all this info. He started programming DataPoint 2200 systems in 1972 while in college!\n\nWe are seeking information and pictures of all other Datapoint systems!\n \n\n\n",
