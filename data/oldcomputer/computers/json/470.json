  "description": "\nThe DAI was renowned for its graphic capabilities but was too expensive !\n\nA lot of peripherals were developped for this computer : a hard disk (8 MB), several floppy disk drives and even a robot !! The DAI can run under CP/M. \n\nWalter Belgers reports us that this system was chosen for a television course on computers in the Netherlands, instead of a computer made by Texas Instruments. What TI then did was to stop selling EPROMs to DAI. In 1983, TI was one of the few manufacturers of EPROM\u0027s, so DAI had many problems delivering the systems and almost went bankrupt.\n \n\n\n",
