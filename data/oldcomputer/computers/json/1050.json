  "description": "\nThe AN/FSQ-7 was by far the largest computer ever built, and is \nexpected to hold that record. It consisted of two complete Whirlwind II computers installed in a 4-story building (See the impressive diagram in the \u0027More Pictures\u0027 section).\n\nEach AN/FSQ supported more than 100 users. IBM had about 60 employees \nat each site for round-the-clock maintenance.\nKeeping one unit operating and one on hot standby (to allow for \nswitchover when vacuum tubes failed) resulted in better than 99% \nuptime. The roles of the two units were reversed at regular \nintervals, allowing diagnostics and maintenance to be carried \nout on the standby unit.\n\nThere were usually several hundred tube failures each day, \nreplaced by workers racing up and down the tube racks with \nshopping carts full of replacements. Automated tests run by the \ncomputer itself would cycle the voltage to the tube racks down \nand back up to induce marginal tubes to fail early, so that the \ncomputer would normally run correctly for the rest of the day. \nWithout this process, the MTBF would have been a few minutes. \n\nBy the time SAGE was deployed (22 or 23 stations in the period \n1959-1963; sources disagree) it was nearly obsolete, since it \nwas designed to detect bombers, not the new ICBMs. Nevertheless \nit was operational until 1979, when the ROCC (Regional \nOperations Control Centers) system took over, using much \nhigher-speed computers. One SAGE station continued operating \nuntil 1983. This last unit was donated to the Boston Computing \nMuseum, since relocated to Moffett Field in Mountain View, \nCalifornia. The museum also has a tube panel from the Whirlwind \nI. Whirlwind II consoles turned up in the TV series Battlestar \nGalactica.\n\nIn spite of its limited military value, the SAGE system served as \nan excellent prototype for an air-traffic control system. The \nFAA operated its own AN/FSQ-7 systems for many years after SAGE \nwas shut down. IBM\u0027s experience with these systems had a great \ndeal to do with its later success in computer systems, and its \ndominance of the market for large computers. The IBM 7090 was \nessentially a solid-state version of the AN/FSQ-7/8. (The 7090 \nhas its own rich history, including hosting the first-ever \nmultiuser APL system.)\n\n? First CRT-based real-time user interface,\n? First use of light gun to pick an item on the screen,\n? First wide-area modem communications (1300 bps),\n? First hot standby system for maximum uptime,\n? First ground control of interceptor aircraft,\n? The first in line microfilm fast processed 35 mm projection displays, preceding printer/plotters. A screen capture could be displayed within 30 seconds,\n? First two-pass assembler, permitting symbolic addresses.\n\nThanks to Edward Cherlin, Simputer Evangelist, for all this information.\nThe photo (from Mitre) shows the rear panel wiring of FSQ-7 arithmetic element frame.\n\n \n\n\n",
