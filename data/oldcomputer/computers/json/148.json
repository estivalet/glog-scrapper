  "description": "\nThe Kaypro 10 was a well known CP/M computer. It is one of the last portable under CP/M. Non Linear Systems had already changed their name to Kaypro when this PC shipped. The company changed its name in 82 and the K10 came out in 83.\n\nThere were two versions, including one with a real-time clock (National MM58167 chip) and a built-in modem (300 baud, Belle System 103 compatibility, uses Texas Instruments TMS-99531/TMS-99532).\n\nThe Kaypro 10 was supplied with a lot of great programs: CP/M 80, the Perfect software suite (Perfect Writer, Perfect Calc, Perfect Filer), WordStar (word processor), dBase II (database), Superterm (terminal emulator) and two BASICs (Microsoft\u0027s BASIC and SBASIC, which was a compiler version written by Gilbert, the head of Kaypro\u0027s software engineering.).\n\nThe great success of the Kaypro 10 led \u0026quot;Non Linear Systems\u0026quot; to change their name officially to Kaypro in 1982. The Non-Linear part continued making test equipment.\n_______________________",
