  "description": "\nThe Compupro 8/16 system was one of the last, big, expensive CP/M system\nthat appeared at the end of the S-100 Bus and 8-bit professional systems\nera.\nIt was actually a typical S-100 box where the user could insert almost any\nS-100 card build by the manufacturer or anybody else.\nAs Compupro manufactured a large range of S-100 card, the system could be\nfitted with either 8-bit and/or 16-bit processor cards. One of the\nbest-selling card was a dual processor 8088 + 8085 that allowed running\nboth 8 bit CP/M and 16 bit MP/M software, at a speed of 2 or 5 Mhz, in a\nmulti-user, multi-tasking environment.\nSeveral advanced CPU cards were available later: Z80 at 8 Mhz,  Intel 80286\nand National Semiconductor 16032.\nDue to the large range of available CPU cards, practically all operating\nsystems and programming languages of the time could be used.\nIt appears that Compupro still exists and offers a limited support, spare parts\nand manual hard copies.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",
