  "description": "\nFour years after Apple introduced its computer, Franklin Computer Corporation thought to duplicate Apple?s achievement and released its first computer, the Franklin Ace 100. \n\nThe ACE 100 was a pure copy of the Apple II. The main board had quite the same design and the ROM content was also exactly identical, aside from the Apple copyright which was removed!\n\nNevertheless, it supported some features that were missing in the Apple II, lower-case letters, and a numeric keypad. The ACE 100 had a short life, hardly one year, and was soon replaced by the ACE 1000\n\nIt found however one\u0027s place in computing history when Apple took legal action against Franklin for counterfeiting and the US Court of Appeals eventually decided in August 1983 that computer programs in ROMs could legally be copyrighted.\n \n\n\n",
