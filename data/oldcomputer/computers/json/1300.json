  "description": "\nPCC 2000 is a professional computer released in 1978. It was designed in 1978 by Pertec, the company which merged with MITS by the end of 1976.\n\nThe PCC is conceived as a monobloc machine, where the display and two 8\u0026quot; floppy disk drives are built-in the main case. The mechanical keyboard offers  separated numeric and editing keypads.\n\nThe system is powered by an Intel 8085 microprocessor and offers 64 KB RAM. The whole thing was apparently delivered with an extended Basic language, which has DOS commands built-in to control the disk drives.\n\nOptions advertised were: \n- CP/M, Cobol, Fortran, Basic compiler languages\n- 10 MB hard disk\n- wordprocessor software\n- multi-terminals\n- multi-tasking\n\nThe PCC 2000 was originaly called the MITS 300/15 and renamed to reflect the Pertec brand. This machine replaced the MITS Altair S-100 computers.\n\nThe PCC 2000 was also marketed by Ordisor in France, as the Ordisor PCC 2000.\n \n\n\n",
