  "description": "\nApart from the Compaq logo, the Compaq Portable 386 was externally identical to the Portable III, but the inside was a true revolution in the portable computers field of the time. Its Intel 386-20 processor offered more speed, power and capabilities than ever before.\n\nAbout the Portable 386, PC Magazine said in its review:\nIts the hottest thing you can pick up with a handle. At 20 MHz, it outperforms everything else on the market but its deskbound sibling . Yet it\u0027s rugged enough for on-the-go computing, takes standard PC cards in an elegantly engineered span-on expansion chassis, and weighs less than 20 pounds. Some folks may not like the styling, but everyone loves the way it performs. \n\nThe portable 386 and Portable III had great success around the world, as well as the desktop versions,  Compaq Deskpro 286-12 and 386/20. At about the same time as the 386 launch, Compaq announced having manufactured its 1- millionth personal computer. \n\nLater, this robust machine was upgraded by third companies up to 486/80 CPU, 10 MB RAM and 9 GB hard-disk.\n \n\n\n",
