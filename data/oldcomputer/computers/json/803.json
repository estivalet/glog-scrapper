  "description": "\nThe SPC-1000 is a Z80-based home computer from Samsung. This machine was developed in Korea, but built-in BASIC was written by Hudson soft in Japan.\n\nBecause of its integrated tape recorder design, it looks like MZ 700 series.\n\nIt has a button \u0027ILP\u0027 on its left side. Pushing ILP button enables this machine to load a new O/S from tape recorder. (This concept resembles MZ 700, too).\n\nThis machine was quite popular at the first time, but advent of MSX and MSX2 pushed this machine off the market.\n\nCP/M was available with double-side, double density floppy disk drives. But the cost of the FDD unit and poor display capability limited its use.\n\nPart of early productions were delivered under the name of SPC-1100.\n\nThanks to Kue-Hwan Sihn from Korea for info and picture.\n\n \n\n\n",
