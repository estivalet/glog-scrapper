  "description": "\nIn 1979, the Bulgarian Techical Cybernetics Institute took up with the idea of creating a small microprocessor based system. \n\nIn 1980 the first three Bulgarian microcomputers were produced. Their creators called the machine IMKO-1 for Individualen Micro KOmputer. In 1981 a series of few tenths machines was released. First users were enthusiastic about the versality and ease of use of the IMKO. Furthermore, the price wasn\u0027t very high.\nMass production started in 1982. First models shipped with a standard TV set instead of a monitor.\n\nThe IMKO-1 was actually an almost 100% compatible Apple II system featuring same expansion slots. Sadly, neither expansion card nor floppy disk unit were available in Bulgaria. Some rare customers bought them from Western European countries or from Taiwan, others used a tape recorder.\n \nThe first international presentation of the IMKO-1 occured at Robotics Symposium in England. Bulgaria demonstrated then a robot controlled by a microcomputer. At this time, Japaneses and U.S. robots were controlled by minicomputers. The IMKO-1 robot system cost thus ten times cheaper and its maintenance was much more easy.\n_______________________",
