  "description": "\nThe motherboard accommodates up to four memory boards, each with 16 K 16 bit words of programmable memory, four IO cards, and an optional front panel card. A parallel IO card includes two 16-bit input and two output ports as well as EPROM sockets for IO device handler sofware.\n\nSystem software includes 8K macroassembler, linker and relocate loader, an editor and a debugger.\n\nThe M16 provides a 8K PACE BASIC which features IO and memory access, wait for input or timer.\n\nAnd, last but not least, it is enclosed in a gun stock walnut veneer cabinet (insert oohs \u0026amp; ahs here).\n\nChad Castagana adds:\nBack in 1986 Micromega came out with a Home Robot called Hernie, similar in utility to the Hero Jr from Tandy.\nThe personal robot looked like a black \u0027Darth Vader\u0027 helmet on wheels, low to the ground. Its \u0027eyes\u0027 where ultrasonic transducers for a sonar locater/ranging system, it also had a musical tone generator and a voice synthesizer. It\u0027s programming language was a variant of BASIC specially written for it and called Mother Ernie.\n \n\n\n",
