The Sanyo MBC-4000 series succeeded to the MBC-1150. It was the same all-in-one system including one (MBC-4000) or two (MBC-4050) 5.25&amp;quot; floppy drives, a monochrome display and a very complete keyboard.

It featured a true 16-bit Intel 8086 CPU and shipped with the CP/M-86 operating system as well as a Basic interpreter and a spreadsheet called Goal.
MS-DOS 2.11 was also available on this machine.

Thanks to John Papadopoulos's site for the picture.
