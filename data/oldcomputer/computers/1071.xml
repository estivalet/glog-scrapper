The Robotron A-5105 was intended to be used in former Eastern Germany schools where it should replace the outdated KC line of computers. Therefore, it was also called BIC which stands for &amp;quot;Bildungscomputer&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;educational computer&amp;quot;)..

Up to 16 computers could be linked into a network which was comprised of one teacher computer and several pupil systems. Each station could access the printers and plotters.

A monochrome monitor was attached to the case but one could also connect a colour RGB monitor or a TV set. 

The network software was called BICLAN. The machine ran SCPX, a special version of the CP/M operating system. The RBASIC interpreter was also in ROM.
