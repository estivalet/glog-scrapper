The PECOM 64 seems to be the 64 KB version of the PECOM 32.

About this computer, Darko Sola from Yougoslavia says:
This is the same model as EI Pecom 32. EI comes from Electronic Industry. Those computers were built in demand from schools. We got this computer in our school to learn Basic (at that time ex-Yugoslav governement had 5 different computer projects). The programming language was Basic with no real graphic commands. Year after, in our school, all those Pecoms were replaced with IBM PC clones. Size of computer was a little bit smaller than A4 page. It had tape as primary media. I do not remember any &amp;quot;Mini FDD&amp;quot;. I don't remember OS, was some home-made based on CP/M (as many systems at that time in Yugoslavia). Price? Not so cheap, It was 2 average monthly salaries.

Thanks to Sveto (Croatia) for the picture.
