Little is known about this obscure professional computer.

The Athena used a true multi-tasking OS that enabled single keystroke application switching. It also incorporated intelligent distributed multiprocessing into perpherial interfaces.

The machine and OS were developed by an MIT graduate and conceived by Solid State Technology from Boston. The Athena is based on a 8085 Intel chipset. Sold with a monochrome monitor and 5.25'' disk drives (320 KB each), it has also a printer (150 characters/s, 80 col.) built-in the case.

Several programming languages were available : compiled BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, PASCAL and APL.

Fewer than one thousand of these machines were produced. The company never gained viability.
