This computer was the portable version of the PC XT.
It was also the second IBM's &amp;quot;transportable&amp;quot; computer. The first one was the IBM
5100, the first personal portable computer ever built that was released in September 1975

The OS was the PC-DOS 2.1, first delivered with the PC Junior.

The portable was equipped with a 9'' amber screen which could display texts and graphics. 

It offered 7 extension slots, 5 being free (4 shorts and only 1 long).

The main drawback of the Portable is that it was not delivered with a hard-disk, and it weights a lot (30lbs) !. On the other hand, it used the same mother board as the IBM 5150 (the classic PC form factor).  This enable an such enclined person to be able to upgrade this computer up to a Pentium II !
