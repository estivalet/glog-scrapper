The EX3000 Computer, a typical success(?) saga of the early personal computer days.

The Extensis Corp. EX3000 computer pulled together four emerging technologies; multiprocessor supercomputers, 8 bit microprocessors, the S100 bus standard and multiprocessor, multitasking multiuser operating systems.

The hardware of the EX3000 system consists of subsystems and boards. Three subsystems were provided :

FOS100 &amp;gt; Floppy disk subsystem (from one to four MB) 
MTS100 &amp;gt; Multiple terminal system with 8 or more independant RS232c serial interfaces 
TPS100 &amp;gt; Terminal / Operator Processor Subsystem with keyboard, CRT, RS232c and expanded video attributes.

And the following boards were included in the EX3000 :

RM64A    &amp;gt; Memory board with 16 KB RAM 
MM16     &amp;gt; Memory Management board with bankswitching up to 1 MB. 
MPU8085  &amp;gt; 8085 Central processor with onboard PROM 
MPU800   &amp;gt; Optional Z80 CPU with onboard PROM 

The operating system, EMOS, is a multi tasking, multi users operating system which provides memory protection for each user. It can handle the two processors simultaneously. Several languages were developped for this operating system : Extended Basic, Cobol and ANSI Fortran.
