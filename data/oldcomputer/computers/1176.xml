The Yamaha C1 was released in 1987 and is basically a 80286 processor 
based PC with 8 built in MIDI ports for use in applications where there 
are many MIDI instruments to address.

By 1987 some machines which were capable of responding on multiple MIDI channels were appearing, and some earlier machines could only function in &amp;quot;omni&amp;quot; mode which meant that they needed a whole 16 channel port to themselves or they would play every time a note intended for another instrument was sent.

Since MIDI information is fairly 'slow' in respect to what even a about 10Mhz computer can handle 8 output ports with buffers wasn't a difficult thing to pull off for even an old 286 apparently.

Various DOS applications were included, among them the Voyetra Sequencer which was set up to run all 8 ports.
