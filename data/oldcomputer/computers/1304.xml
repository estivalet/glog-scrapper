The TA 1600 system was introduced in 1983 at the CeBIT (which was only a part of the &amp;quot;Hannover-Messe&amp;quot; by that time). TA showed a few sample applications and the 1600 family in general.

Triumph Adler's hardware included also the 1600/20-3 which was supplied with a permanent-swap-HDD-unit. This unit had a memory/storage capacity of 2 x 8 MB (Winchester technology).

Triumph Adler said the system (the 1600) will fit the demand of medium-sized businesses, due to the facts that these companies will need more storage capacities and much more flexibility at the external storage solutions.
For the 1600/20 as well as the 1600/30 models were new 64 KB chipset modules available which extended the RAM to a maximum of 1 MB.

Software on the 1600 systems had the focus on the classic office computing (EDP). The standard package was called &amp;quot;TABS 1600&amp;quot; and included applications like, payroll accounting, stock management. But also, there were applications for special businesses available.

The pricing of the 1600 family started at 13.000 DM (German Mark) for a single system up to 250.000 DM for a &amp;quot;Multi-user-dialogue-system&amp;quot;.
