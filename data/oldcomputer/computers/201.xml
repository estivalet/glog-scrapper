The only display device is a very small LED screen (R2E said then that screen wasn't necessary with business computers, what were they thinking!). It has a built-in thermal printer (48 columns, 28 cps). It runs under Prologue and is sold with BAL, a business language (which is a mixture between Basic and Cobol). Notice that R2e is the company that made the first micro computer in 1972: the R2E Micral.
