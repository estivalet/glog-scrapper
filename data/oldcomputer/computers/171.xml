The information we have about this computer is sketchy.
O.S. was a powerful graphical BASIC interpreter modded from the TI basic.
Forth language was also available but not widely used.
Cortex had a mode to give 256 K RAM. ROM was copied into RAM at start-up and then swiched off allowing boot code and basic to be altered at start-up.
Cortex was followed by the Cortex II which was just a re cased version with same style as early apple/dragon 32 beige/yellow plastic sloping cases, but using same main board and disk drives.
