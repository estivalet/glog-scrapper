This is a french professionnal computer which had no success.

It was sold with two 5''1/4 floppy-drives (40 tracks, 360k each) but, could be replaced by 80 tracks ones.

A Winchester 5''1/4 hard disk (5 or 10 Mb) can be connected with a special interface, as well as two external 8&amp;quot; floppy disk-drives.

It also has a built-in battery (1 hour long) and a real-time clock built-in.

The Guepard was delivered with a Basic, an Assembler and two operating systems (New DOS 80-2.0 and CP/M+)
