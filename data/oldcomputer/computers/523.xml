All the information we have come from a copy of a 1975 brochure of an NBI Hantu (later renamed to the System II).

It boasted an Intel 8008 processor up to 16K of RAM and two 8&amp;quot; 250K floppies.

NBI was the first software based wordprocessing system on the market.  At that time, the competition had to change firmware each time the program was changed.

NBI officially stood for &amp;quot;Nothing But Intials&amp;quot;, however the real origin of the name NBI was &amp;quot;Necton Bilinium Incorporated&amp;quot; a name chosen by one of the company founders - Binx Selsby.

Thanks to Kenny Stamm for all this information.
