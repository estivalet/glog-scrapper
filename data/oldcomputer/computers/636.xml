The &amp;quot;Miniterm&amp;quot; portable computer terminal was the Computer Devices Incorporated's primary product.

This &amp;quot;hand-carried&amp;quot; computer was preprogrammed to lead sales, manufacturing, and other untrained in computer operation through data processing tasks. Stored on a minicassette, the program was called up automatically when the computer is switched on.

Model 1206/PAT had a 64k processor with 32k RAM and included a modem acoustic coupler, and an 80-column thermal printer that could produce 50 characters per second. Programs were developped in Basic or in Motorola 6800 assembly language on a companion unit.

Options included a 132-column printer, alphanumeric bar-code reader, and a 1.44 MB disk drive.
