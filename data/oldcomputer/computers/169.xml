The Hector MX is the successor of the Victor / Hector 2HR and Hector HRX.
It has the same characteristics as the 2HR and the HRX. The 2HR uses Basic, the HRX uses Forth, the MX uses both as available programming languages ! Its 64 KB ROM contains BASIC 3X, HRX Forth, a version of Logo and a machine language editor/assembler. Several other languages were available on cartridge as well, but there are not true ROM cartridges. They plug onto the Centronics port, and when the Hector detects it, it transfers its contents into RAM.

This computer was designed to be an educational computer, but it didn't have great market success, Very few of them were actually sold.
