The BFM 186 is a CAD computer. The expansion slots are not compatible with the IBM PC's : they are 16 bit slots contrary to the PC's which are 8 bit. 
The graphic system of this computer is a bit ugly : it has two video processors, one of them handles a character plane and the other one handles three graphic planes. Each graphic plane has a resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels but only a part of these planes (960 x 625) can be displayed, moreover, each plan can be zoomed (from 1 to 16) and can scroll in the four directions. The 3 graphic planes are independant and can be switched. The two display processors work together so it is possible to have on the screen simultanously one character plane and one graphic plane.
