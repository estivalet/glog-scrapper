It was either a PC-XT you can fit in your hand, or a &amp;quot;PDA&amp;quot; that also happened to run countless DOS programs.

The PIM software was very powerful and comprehensive, included the usual address Book, Appointments, and Notepad / Memo capabilities, as well as a Database program. Plus, Pocket Quicken, Lotus 123, and cc:Mail.  Also has a 
&amp;quot;Filer&amp;quot; program for file management, LapLink to connect with a desktop 
system for file transfer, and a Data Comm program for connecting to 
online services, and more!

Because it ran MS DOS 5.0 and had the architecture of a PC-XT with a CGA graphics adaptor, it was able to run almost any DOS software which would run on a similar desktop system.
  
Using a PCMCIA flash-memory card in lieu of a hard-drive allowed limitless storage space. System Memory was divided between normal RAM and a RAM-disk which became your C:\ drive. The 2MB model gave you 640 KB system Ram and about 1400 KB of C: drive.

The keyboard was a little small for touch-typing, but it could be done.  
Keys had a slight tactile click to them.  The IR port was not IRDA, 
being an older HP IR format instead.  The Serial port was standard 
RS-232 signals but was a small non-standard 10-pin design.  The pins 1-9 
had the same assignments as a 9-pin serial port, the 10th being shell 
ground.

The 200LX was third in a series, the HP-95LX was first but had much 
more limited features, the HP-100LX was second and was almost 
identical, except was lacking some of the more-advanced PIM software.  
There was also the HP-1000CX which was identical to the 200LX except it 
had no PIM software at all, it was strictly a DOS 5.0 palmtop.
