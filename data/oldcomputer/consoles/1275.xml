This version of the Saturn was produced by Samsung under licence from Sega exclusively for the Korean market.

Unusually for the Saturn there seems to only one version of this particular console (SPC-ST2). It features a stange mix of components from the different versions of the Saturn available elswhere. The case is of the early oval buttoned type but uses the motherboard from the newer round buttoned type, resulting in some strange characteristics. For example, the console has a reset button that isn't connected and there are labels for the CD access light on the case but no actual light.

The BIOS is also rather odd. Japanese has been removed from the language selection screen but Korean hasn't been added so no &amp;quot;native language&amp;quot; is available
