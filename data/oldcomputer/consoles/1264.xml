Released towards the end of 1998 in Japan, the Neo Geo Pocket was yet another challenger to Nintendo's Game Boy. 

The Neo Geo Pocket had great battery life (even the Pocket Color managed around 40 hours from just two batteries!), an area where so many Game Boy competitors had failed, and a number of SNK's popular arcade games appeared on the system. 

But the sales figures were lower than SNK were expecting and the machine was discontinued after just a few months, only to be immediately replaced by the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Due to it's short lifespan the original Neo Geo Pocket was never released outside Asia. 

An unusual feature of the Neo Geo Pocket is that it's forwards compatible and is therefore able to play most (but not all) of the Neo Geo Pocket Color games.
