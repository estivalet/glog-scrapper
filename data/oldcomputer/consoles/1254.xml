Arcade video games have always played a major role in video games history. Technologicaly in advance upon home video game systems, they have inspired generations of game developers. Indeed most of the computer/consoles game library was directly copied from Arcade games. At least until the 90's when home systems began to match arcade systems performances. This was the beginning of the end for the Arcades.
