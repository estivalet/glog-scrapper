  "description": "\nAfter Sony and Nintendo\u0027s collaboration on the Super CD-ROM came to an end, Sony continued their research and decided to make a stand alone console. A deal was reached with Nintendo to allow the Play Station (as it was called then) to play SNES cartridges. This feature was dropped from the final design, and the name changed to PlayStation.\n\nA powerful machine, the PlayStation featured 3D graphics capabilities which at the time were remarkable. Games like Tomb Raider made 3D game worlds popular and effectively put an end to the 2D shoot \u0027em ups and platformers which had been around since the late \u002770s and early \u002780s. \n\nEarly units suffered from problems with the laser mechanism. The CD tray was made from plastic and over a period of time would wear away resulting in games no longer working. A common solution was to turn the console on its side or even upside down to relieve stress on the laser\u0027s motor. Later units had a metal tray to prevent this problem. \n\nEven to this day the PlayStation is often wrongly referred to as the PSX, the correct term being PS. PSX was the name given to the PlayStation based arcade hardware and later a Japanese only version of the PS2, which was capable of digital video recording and featured either a 160 GB or 250 GB hard drive.\n \nA redesigned machine named PSone was released in 2000. This smaller version lacked the serial port but was otherwise fully compatible with older games. The PS and PSone achieved combined sales of more than 102 million units between them, making the PlayStation the first ever console to break the 100 million mark. In the process PlayStation became a household name, ended Nintendo\u0027s domination of the market and fought off competition from Sega\u0027s Saturn and Dreamcast, which no doubt had an influence on Sega\u0027s decision to pull out of the console hardware business.\n\n______________\n\nContributors: Ste (text \u0026amp; info)\n \n\n\n",

The chassis also provides a 12-slot S-100 mother board which contains a Real-Time Interrupt, two RS-232C serial ports, one 8-bit parallel port and power regulation circuitry for the integrated floppy disk drives. Either a 115 or 230 volt power supply with sufficient power for all 12 slots and the disk drives is also included. The use of high speed (200 nsec) Dynamic RAM and \u0026quot;fast stepping\u0026quot; floppy disk drives, along with the 4 MHz CPU, delivers the highest average performance of all comparable microcomputers as measured by independent benchmark studies! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;SOFTWARE\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The power and versatility of the HORIZON computer is further enhanced by a wide range of system and application software.
