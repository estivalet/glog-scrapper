  "description": "\nThe Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released in Japan in 1983 under the name Famicom. This was short for Family Computer. Hundreds of games were produced for the system and it sold very well.\n\nIt had one of the most unique accessories too; R.O.B (Robotic Operating Buddy). It was controlled by flashes from the screen generated by the game itself. It couldn\u0027t do much except move around some discs from one platform to another. It was popular because it was something different.\n\nThe NES was home to some of the biggest franchises in video game history and there are still games being made based on characters first seen on the NES. Characters like Mario (who technically was first seen in the Arcades in Donkey-Kong game, though he was called then only \u0026quot;jumpman\u0026quot;), Samus (Metroid), and Link.\n\nOther companies like Sega (Master System) and Atari (Atari 7800) tried to get a piece of the pie with their own systems but neither of them were able to come anywhere near the sales figures of the Nintendo. There is no doubt that the NES was the most popular 8-bit gaming system.\n\nIn the early \u002790s Nintendo redesigned the NES. It was top-loading design and the controllers looked alot like SNES controller except with only 2 buttons. The Famicom (japanese version of the NES) had the longest production life of any console ever to this day from 1983 to 2004 in Japan. It shifted 60 million units in its life time!\n\nA bunch of accessories were available for the NES \u0026amp; Famicom, including : lightgun, ROB the robot, disk drives, BASIC keyboard, dancing mat, power glove, additional controllers and much more...\n \n\n\n",

The chassis also provides a 12-slot S-100 mother board which contains a Real-Time Interrupt, two RS-232C serial ports, one 8-bit parallel port and power regulation circuitry for the integrated floppy disk drives. Either a 115 or 230 volt power supply with sufficient power for all 12 slots and the disk drives is also included. The use of high speed (200 nsec) Dynamic RAM and \u0026quot;fast stepping\u0026quot; floppy disk drives, along with the 4 MHz CPU, delivers the highest average performance of all comparable microcomputers as measured by independent benchmark studies! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;SOFTWARE\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The power and versatility of the HORIZON computer is further enhanced by a wide range of system and application software.
