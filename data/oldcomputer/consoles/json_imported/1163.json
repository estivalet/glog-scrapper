  "description": "\nThe Mustang 9016 is one of the few RCA Studio II clones. You sould read its entry for more info about the Mustang itself.\n\nThe Mustang 9016 is thus a programmmable console which looks like a pong system, the most popular systems when the RCA Studio appeared. Like the Studio II, the Mustang 9016 seems to also have 5 built in games: Bowling, Freeway (car racing), Patterns, Doodles, and Math (any confirmation would be nice).\n\nThe controllers are quite basic: only two numeric keypads built-in the system, labeled \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; for left player and \u0026quot;B\u0026quot; for right player. The numeric keypads are composed of ten keys numbered from 0 to 9. Arrows are also drawn next to the keys to indicate that \u0026quot;4\u0026quot; is for left, \u0026quot;6\u0026quot; for right, \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; for up, \u0026quot;3\u0026quot; for up-right, etc. \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; is thus often used as the fire button (depending on games of course).\n\nSome years after RCA Studio II was released, color clone systems like the Mustang 9016 appeared in Europe.  They were clearly marketed as cheap systems for people who couldn\u0027t afford more \u0026quot;modern\u0026quot; systems like the Colecovision or Vectrex.  They include the Soundic MPT-02 Victory, Hanimex MPT-02, Mustang 9016 Telespiel Computer, Conic M-1200 and the Sheen 1200 Micro Computer.  Some have modifications from the original RCA Studio II such as detachable controllers or even color graphics.  There were also some new cartridges produced for these systems, such as Concentration Match for the MPT-02 systems. The Mustang 9016 has no detachable controllers but offers color display.\n\nIt is interesting to notice that MPT-02 systems are Studio RCA 2 software-compatible, MPT-03 are Emerson Arcadia 2001 software-compatible and MPT-04/05 systems are Interton VC-4000 software-compatible systems...\n\nIf you want to learn more about the RCA Studio II and its clones, click here.\nThe RCA Cosmac VIP computer is also quite related to the RCA Studio II and clones.\n \n\n\n",

Simple to build, simple to operate. A powerful, full facility computer with all the features you would expect.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Just connect the assembled computer to any domestic TV and power source and you are ready to begin. (Power requirement: 8V at 800mA). There is an ATOM power unit available. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Free with every ATOM, kit or built, is a computer manual. The first section explains and teaches you BASIC, the language that most personal computers and the ATOM operate in. The instructions are simple and learning quickly becomes a pleasure. You\u0027ll soon be writing your own programs. The second section is a reference manual giving a full description of the ATOM\u0027s facilities and how to use them. Both sections arE fully illustrated with example programs. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The standard ATOM includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; HARDWARE\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .

As you build confidence and knowledge you can add more components. For instance the next stage might be to increase the ROM and RAM on the basic ATOM from 8K + 2K to 12K + 12K respectively. This will give you a direct printer drive, floating point mathematics, scientific and trigonometric functions, high resolution graphics.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; From there you can expand indefinitely. Acorn have produced an enormous range of compatible PCB\u0027s which can be added to your original computer. For instance: A module to give red, green and blue colour signals Teletext VDU card (for Prestel and Ceefax information) An in-board connector for a communications loop interface - any number of ATOMs may be linked to each other or to a master system with mass storage/hard copy facility. \u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Paul Durrant\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
