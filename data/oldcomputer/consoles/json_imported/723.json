  "description": "\nFew information is known about this obscure system...\n\nIt is software compatible with the Interton VC-4000 and \u0026quot;clones\u0026quot;. This doesn\u0027t mean that it can use the Interton cartridges, as they certainly won\u0027t fit, but the internal specs and software are the same. The CPU is the 2650A from Signetics and the Video Controller is the 2636 from Signetics as well. About 40 cartridges has been released for the Interton VC-4000, but we can\u0027t tell how many were available for the TRQ H-21, nor if exclusive games were developped for it...\n\nLike with all the systems of this \u0026quot;Interton family\u0026quot;, there are two controllers with 12 buttons keypad + 2 fire buttons + a joystick. Apparently the controllers were designed to use informative plastic layers delivered with each games, showing the functions of each key. The control panel is composed of an ON/OFF switch and three buttons: Carga (Load/Reset), Seleccion (Select) and Inicio (Start). In fact when you switch on the console, you must press \u0026quot;Carga\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;load\u0026quot; the game.\n\n\n___________\n\nThanks to Juan Maestre for some info.\n \n\n\n",
