  "description": "\nRumoured to be a follow up to the PC Engine, the Super Grafx turned out to be merely an update. It was released without any warning by NEC and never found a place in the marketplace because earlier PCE consoles were still being manufactured at the same time.\n\nDespite having four times the RAM, it featured the same 8 bit processor and sound capabilities as the PC Engine, although it now had an extra GPU. Having two GPUs meant the Super Grafx could display two background layers and allowed more depth and colour, but they were limited by the processor and didn\u0027t really give the system much of a performance boost.\n\nThe console didn\u0027t sell well and games were expensive at around $110. Only six games were specifically released for the Super Grafx, the most notable being Capcom\u0027s 1941 which is not available for any other console, and today reaches very high prices, especially when in complete condition, as it had a rather fragile cardboard box that easily gets ruined. \n\nFortunately the Super Grafx was compatible with all the PC Engine\u0027s HuCard and CD games. In fact, it is the only machine that can play all the games released for the PCE series of consoles. Although it was designed to be used with the newer Super CD-ROM? drive, which was released at around the same time, it can also be used with the old CD-ROM? drive by using the RAU-30 adapter.\n\n________________\n\nText co-written by *_Ste_* and Taneli Lukka\n \n\n\n",

Simple-to-build, simple-to-operate. But a really powerful full-facility computer. And designed on an expandable basis. You can buy a superb expanded package now-tailored to your needs. Or, you can buy just the standard Atom kit, and, as you grow in confidence and knowledge, add more chips. No need to replace your equipment. No need to worry that your investment will be overtaken by new technology. As you need more power, more facilities, you can add them! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The standard ATOM kit includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Full sized QWERTY keyboard. Rugged polystyrene case\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Fibreglass PCB. 2K RAM. 8K ROM. 23 integrated circuits . Full assembly instructions including tests for fault-finding. (Once built, connect it to any domestic TV and power source)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Power requirement: 8V at 800 M A. ATOM power unit available.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; PLUS FREE MANUAL written in two sections \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; - teach yourself BASIC and machine code for those with no knowledge of computers, and a reference section giving a complete description of the ATOM\u0027s facilities. All sections are fully illustrated with example programs.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM concept\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Adding chips into sockets on the PCB allows you to progress in affordable steps to large-scale expansion. You can see from the specifications that the RAM can be increased to 12K allowing high resolution (256 x 192) graphics. Two further ROM chips, e.g. maths functions, can be added directly to the board giving a 16K capacity. In addition to 5 I/O lines partly used by the cassette interface, an optional VIA device can provide varied I/O and timer functions and via a buffer device allow direct printer drive. An optional module provides red, green and blue signals for colour. An in-board connector strip takes the ATOM communications loop interface. Any number of ATOMs may be tinked to each other - or to a master system with mass storage, hard copy facility. Interface with other ACORN cards is simplicity itself. Anyone ACORN card may be fitted internally.
