  "description": "\nThe Hanimex HMG-7900 is a low-range console with rather simplistic games. It was released around 1983. It is one of these cheap systems produced in Asia for people not able to buy more expensive systems of that time.\n\nThough different in shape, the HMG-7900 is internaly the same system as the Rollet Video-Color and the ITMC-SD290. The HMG-7900 itself was sold under different brands throughout Europe (Soundic Soundicvision SD-200 in Scandinavia for example). There were surely all produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as all the systems have code-names like \u0026quot;SD-2xx\u0026quot; (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!!\n\nWhat is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese Cassette Vision from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...\n\nThe HMG-7900 is rectangular shaped, gray coloured and rather small (32 X 18 X 7 cm). It was delivered with only one controller which connects to the left side of the system. There is a second connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player controller, but as all the games were for one player only, it was never used. The controller can be stored in its compartment located on the top of the console. It is composed of a 4-directions disc on which can be screwed a little stick. There is also a knob for Breakout-type games and two orange fire buttons (which have the same function) located on both sides of the joystick.\n\nThe control panel is made of three buttons and an on/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.\n\nThe cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top-left part of the console, just above the joystick storage compartment. Below it is written: \u0026quot;Programmable Color Video Game \u0026quot;.\n\nInside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Nothing is known about this one, it might be an all-in-one microcontroller... Hopefully Richard Gellman wrote to tell us more:\n\nI did some searching on various internet resources to try and find out about the D779C CPU chipset. It seems to be completely obscure, and restricted to the ITMC SD-290.\n\nNEC were known for cloning other CPUS; The D780C was a clone of the Z80. The D779C appears to be more a \u0026quot;system\u0026quot; chip, like a microcontroller. It may be a custom-made Z80 MCU with certain features removed for cost.\n\nUnfortunately, as there is no information available I can not confirm this, so this is a \u0026quot;best educated guess\u0026quot;.\n\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Attack or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!\n\nThere was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?). These cartridges were: Football, Ski, Ice-skating (!), Car-Race and Tennis.\n \n\n\n",
