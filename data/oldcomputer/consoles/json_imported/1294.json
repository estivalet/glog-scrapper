  "description": "\nThough different in shape, the Soundic SD-290 is internaly the same system as the Rollet Video-Color, the Hanimex HMG-7900 and the Soundicvision SD-200. This SD-290 model was sold worldwide through different brands (in France for example by ITMC and Jou?Club)...\n\nAll these systems were surely produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as they have code-names like \u0026quot;SD-2xx\u0026quot; (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!! \n\nWhat is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese Cassette Vision from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...\n\nThe Soundic SD-290 is square shaped, the case is white and blue colored with orange buttons and controls. It was delivered with only one controller which connects to the left side of the system. There is a second connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player controller, but as all the games were for one player only, it was never used. The controller can be stored in its compartment located on the top of the console. It is composed of a 4-directions disc on which can be screwed a little stick. There is also a knob for Breakout-type games and an orange fire button.\n\nThe control panel is made of three buttons and an on/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.\n\nThe cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top-left part of the console, just above the joystick storage compartment. Like on the HMG-7900, the case is labeled \u0026quot;Programmable Color Video Game\u0026quot;. Inside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Nothing is known about this one... can you help please?\n\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Command or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!\n\nThere was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?). These cartridges were: Football, Ski, Ice-skating (!), Car-Race and Tennis.\n \n\n\n",
