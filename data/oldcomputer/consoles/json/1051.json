  "description": "\nWhat a funky system ! This is a french system, made in Toulouse, south of France. Soci?t? Occitane d\u0027El?ctronique often released systems (pongs, consoles and computers) with original 70\u0027s cosmetic design.\n\nIt is software compatible with the Interton VC-4000 and \u0026quot;clones\u0026quot;. This doesn\u0027t mean that it can use the Interton cartridges, as they won\u0027t fit, but the internal specs and software are the same. The CPU is the 2650A from Signetics and the Video Controller is the 2636 from Signetics as well. About 40 cartridges has been released for the Interton VC-4000, but we can\u0027t tell how many were available for the OC-2000, nor if exclusive games were developped for it...\n\nLike with all the systems of this \u0026quot;Interton family\u0026quot;, there are two controllers with 12 buttons keypad + a joystick. Controllers were designed to use informative plastic layers delivered with each games, showing the functions of each key. The control panel is composed of an ON/OFF switch and 5 buttons. But the most original feature is the cartridge storage compartment located in the middle of the case. Here you can store up to 7 cartridges, waiting to be played. The whole compartment is covered by a removable transparent plastic part. The cosmetic aspect of the console is thus excellent !\n\nThere were several models only different by their case colour. Strangely some white models were not marketed as OC-2000 but under the \u0026quot;Jeu video TV - Karvan\u0026quot; name.\n\nThe most interesting feature of the OC-2000 is surely the cartridge N?13 called \u0026quot;Hobby Computer\u0026quot;. It turned the console into a real Signetics 2650-based computer, with 2 KB RAM and 2 KB ROM. You had to program it in assembler via the two controller keypads and the console function buttons. There was even a tape-interface so you could save your creations onto tapes. This was maybe never commercialy released but was at least produced and sent to some journalists (Thanks to Fran?ois Houste for the info).\n\nOne particularity about this videogame \u0026quot;family\u0026quot; (VC-4000 \u0026amp; clones), is that they seem to be the only systems which required the game to be loaded into internal RAM from the cartridge, before being able to play (generally through a LOAD PROGRAM or equivalent button found on the control panel).\n \n\n\n",
