  "description": "\nThough this it looks like a common European pong system, the Poppy 9017 is quite particular for it offers 4 pongs games, 2 shooting games AND 4 motor cycle games in the same case... wow\n\nThe 4 classic pongs games (Tennis, Soccer, Squash, Practice) and 2 shooting games (Moving target, S.L. Target) are almost certainly offered by the General Instrument AY-3-8512 chipset. The shooting games are only playable with the optional light gun. The 4 motor cycle games (Drag race, Stunt Cycle, Motor Cross, Enduro) are powered by the General Instruments AY-3-8760 chipset. This two GI chipsets are used in this system, which is quite unsual\n\nWhile the 6 pong games are selected with a knob, the 4 motor cycle games are selected through 4 buttons. Seven swicthes offer the folowing functions: Serve (auto/manu), Ball angle (20?, 60?), Ball speed (high/low), Bat size (small/large), Cycle (hard/easy), Power (on/off) and Game type (Paddle/Rifle or Cycle). The two detachable paddles have no fire button...\n\nThe Tele-Partner Model G is the same system.\n\n________\n\nThanks to Emil Panasiuk for the picture.\n \n\n\n",

Simple-to-build, simple-to-operate. But a really powerful full-facility computer. And designed on an expandable basis. You can buy a superb expanded package now-tailored to your needs. Or, you can buy just the standard Atom kit, and, as you grow in confidence and knowledge, add more chips. No need to replace your equipment. No need to worry that your investment will be overtaken by new technology. As you need more power, more facilities, you can add them! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The standard ATOM kit includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Full sized QWERTY keyboard. Rugged polystyrene case\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Fibreglass PCB. 2K RAM. 8K ROM. 23 integrated circuits . Full assembly instructions including tests for fault-finding. (Once built, connect it to any domestic TV and power source)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Power requirement: 8V at 800 M A. ATOM power unit available.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; PLUS FREE MANUAL written in two sections \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; - teach yourself BASIC and machine code for those with no knowledge of computers, and a reference section giving a complete description of the ATOM\u0027s facilities. All sections are fully illustrated with example programs.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM concept\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Adding chips into sockets on the PCB allows you to progress in affordable steps to large-scale expansion. You can see from the specifications that the RAM can be increased to 12K allowing high resolution (256 x 192) graphics. Two further ROM chips, e.g. maths functions, can be added directly to the board giving a 16K capacity. In addition to 5 I/O lines partly used by the cassette interface, an optional VIA device can provide varied I/O and timer functions and via a buffer device allow direct printer drive. An optional module provides red, green and blue signals for colour. An in-board connector strip takes the ATOM communications loop interface. Any number of ATOMs may be tinked to each other - or to a master system with mass storage, hard copy facility. Interface with other ACORN cards is simplicity itself. Anyone ACORN card may be fitted internally. So you can see there are a vast number of modular options and additions available, expanding with your ability and your budget.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM hardware includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Memory from 2K to 12K RAM on board (up to 35K in case)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .8K to 16K ROM (two 4K additions) 86502 processor\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Video Display allows high resolution (256 x 192) graphics and red, green and blue output\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Cassette Interface-CUTS 300 baud\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Loudspeaker allows tone generation of any frequency\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Channel36 UHF Modulator Output .Bus output includes internal connections for Acorn Eurocard.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM software includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .32-bit arithmetic (+/- 2,000,000,000)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .High speed execution\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .43 standard/extended BASIC commands \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Variable length strings (up to 256 characters)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .String manipulation functions\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 32-bit integer variables\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 additional arrays\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .random number function .PUT and GET byte\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .WAIT command for timing\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .DO-UNTIL construction\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Logical operators (AND, OR, EX-OR)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .LINK to machine-code routines\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Plot draw and move. \u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Paul Durrant\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
