  "description": "\nThis is another incarnation of the classic systems using cartridges based on General Instruments chips.\n\nTen small buttons, are used to select the different games offered by the inserted cartridge. The cartridge offering the greatest number of games is 10-ball-speile with 10 games. The playing options are activated by the three switches. Each option depends on the cartridge inserted, the meaning of switches being explained on each cartridge label. The joysticks are detachable and are connected to the system through connectors placed on each side.\n\nCartridges released are the classic ones for these systems using cartridges based on General Instrument chips: Ball games, Motorcycle, Car racing, Submarine, Super wipeout, Tank battle and maybe Shooting gallery. These are generic english titles. Real titles are in German.\n\nConcerning the Tank Battle cartridge, the problem is that this game requires digital controllers as opposed to the analog joystick of the system. The Palladium system is one of the few GI based systems which offered optional numeric keypads to play this game!\n\nThe shooting games require the use of a light gun. It\u0027s not clear if the Tele-Cassetten-Game can use one, and thus if there is such a cartridge for this system (anyone can confirm this?).\n\nThere are in fact two models of the Palladium Tele-Cassetten-Game. The cases are different (see \u0026quot;more pictures\u0026quot; section), but everything else is identical (games, front panel, controllers, etc.). Why two systems? Maybe Palladium first marketed this licenced product using a \u0026quot;common\u0026quot; case used by other brands such as MBO and Optim, and then decided to redesign its own case so that consumers would identify more clearly the Palladium system...\n\nThis system (at least the \u0026quot;first\u0026quot; case style) was also marketed as the MBO Tele-Cassetten-System and Optim 600...\n \n\n\n",
