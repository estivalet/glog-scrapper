  "description": "\nThe Rollet Videocolor is a low-range console with rather simplistic games. It was released around 1983. It is one of these cheap systems produced in Asia for people not able to buy more expensive systems of that time.\n\nThough different in shape, Rollet Videocolor is internaly the same system as the Hanimex HMG-7900 and the ITMC-SD290. There were surely all produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as all the systems have code-names like \u0026quot;SD-2xx\u0026quot; (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. The Videocolor motherboard for example, is labeled SD-270. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!!\n\nWhat is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese Cassette Vision from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...\n\nThe shape and look of the Videocolor is quite funky, all yellow coloured with big blue buttons. It was clearly intended to be sold as a toy and manipulated by children. There is one built-in screwable joystick mounted on a disk, one fire button and a dial to play breakout games. Though there is a second controller connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player, it was never used, as all games were for one player only. This connector is exactly the same as those found on the Hanimex HMG-7900 for example, so these controllers could be used with the Videocolor.\n\nThe control panel is made of three big buttons and an on/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.\n\nThe cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top part of the console. Inside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Nothin is known about this one... can you help please?\n\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Attack or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!\n\nThere was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?). These cartridges were: Football, Ski, Ice-skating (!), Car-Race and Tennis.\n \n\n\n",
