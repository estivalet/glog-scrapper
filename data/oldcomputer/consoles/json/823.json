  "description": "\nThough different in shape, the ITMC SD-290 is internaly the same system as the Rollet Video-Color and the Hanimex HMG-7900. The SD-290 model was sold in France by ITMC, but could also be found under the Jou?Club brand (Jou?CLub SD-290)...\n\nAll these systems were surely produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as they have code-names like \u0026quot;SD-2xx\u0026quot; (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!! \n\nWhat is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese Cassette Vision from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...\n\nThe ITMC SD-290 is square shaped, the case is white and blue colored with orange buttons and controls. It was delivered with only one controller which connects to the left side of the system. There is a second connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player controller, but as all the games were for one player only, it was never used. The controller can be stored in its compartment located on the top of the console. It is composed of a 4-directions disc on which can be screwed a little stick. There is also a knob for Breakout-type games and an orange fire button.\n\nThe control panel is made of three buttons and an on/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.\n\nThe cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top-left part of the console, just above the joystick storage compartment. Like on the HMG-7900, the case is labeled \u0026quot;Programmable Color Video Game\u0026quot;.\n\nInside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Almost nothing is known about it. Hopefully Richard Gellman wrote to tell us more:\n\nI did some searching on various internet resources to try and find out about the D779C CPU chipset. It seems to be completely obscure, and restricted to the ITMC SD-290.\n\nNEC were known for cloning other CPUS; The D780C was a clone of the Z80. The D779C appears to be more a \u0026quot;system\u0026quot; chip, like a microcontroller. It may be a custom-made Z80 MCU with certain features removed for cost.\n\nUnfortunately, as there is no information available I can not confirm this, so this is a \u0026quot;best educated guess\u0026quot;.\n\nThe games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Attack or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!\n\nThere was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?). These cartridges were: Football, Ski, Ice-skating (!), Car-Race and Tennis.\n \n\n\n",

Both use the SS-50. bus architecture. However, the MSI 6800 overcomes the engineering disadvan\u0026shy;tages associated with the MIKBUG monitor, incomplete address decoding, interface ad\u0026shy;dresses in the middle of user memory, inade\u0026shy;quate power supply, and mother board capacity. The MSI 6800 system has a 20 amp power supply and a heavy duty mother board with 16 slots and gold-plated connectors. Our CPU Board has separate baud rate and system clocks, 4K of EPROM memory and a much improved MIKBUG compatible monitor. MSI interface cards bring all strappable options to a DB-25 connector on the rear panel via a rib\u0026shy;bon cable connector. This permits any terminal to be plugged into the computer without alteration of the interface card. Other advantages of the MSI 6800 are described in this catalog. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Can I use my SWTP memory boards and interface boards in the new MSI 6800 Com\u0026shy;puter?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Yes, since the bus architecture is identical, they will worlk fine. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Can I use the MSI 6800 mother board and power supply only to beef up my SWTP 6800 system?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Yes, the MSI mother board (MB-1) has the same hole centers as the SWTP mother board and will mount easily in the SWTP chassis. However, the MSI interface adapter board (IA-1) must also be used to furnish an interface bus. The MSI power supply (PS-1) may also be used to replace the SWTP supply. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Is the MSI6800 available wired and tested?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Yes, see catalog listings. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Can I use the MSI CPU card in my SWTP 6800 system in order to gain a faster system clock and on board EPROM memory?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Yes, however the MSI power supply should also be used in order to adequately supply the EPROM memory. A MIKBUG replacement monitor must also be used if interface ad\u0026shy;dresses used by MIKBUG are to be retained. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Questions About the FD-8 Disk Memory System\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; I have an SWTP 6800 System. What is needed to hook up your FD..a Floppy Disk Memory to my system?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The FD..a Disk Memory System interfaces to any microprocessor system via a single PIA chip. For the SWTP 6800 System, we furnish our PIA-1 interface card which plugs in directly to port 7 of the interface bus. A ribbon cable then plugs into the interface card and to the disk. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; What software is provided with the FD-8 Disk System?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; MSI provides a complete disk operating system software package for use with 6800 based microprocessor systems. The operating system gives the user the capability of having named files at three levels: object code files, source code files for the assembler, and BASIC files. The system contains a coresident as\u0026shy;sembler/editor which can pull source files from disk, assemble, and pass object code to either tape cassette or disk memory. Password pro\u0026shy;tection is available for both program as well as random and sequential data.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The new TSC editor is now available in a MSI FD-8 disk version. This excellent editor allows very long source files to be stored on disk, edited, and assembled with the object code being placed on disk as well.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; In BASIC, both program as well as random and sequential disk data files are available. All files are named with optional password pro\u0026shy;tection. Other basic programs on disk can be chained to or called as subroutines from a parent program. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; What charges are made for software, and what documentation do I receive?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The complete disk operating system, in\u0026shy;cluding the coresident assembler/editor are provided free of charge with the purchase of an FD..a Disk System. A $65.00 charge is made for MSI BASIC. An operating manual for disk oper\u0026shy;ating system, assembler/editor, and BASIC is provided. Partial source documentation is also provided for the input and output routines and other appropriate addresses. In addition, com\u0026shy;plete source documentation is provided for the disk driver subroutines and MINIDOS which allows the user to read or write any desired sector or number of sectors from any beginning disk location to any destination in computer memory. This enables the user to have access to the disk in his own assembly language pro\u0026shy;grams or by direct communication with the control terminal completely independently from the MSI disk operating system. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Is it possible to interface the FD-8 Floppy Disk to microcomputer systems using the 8080, Z80, or 6502 processors? If so, do you provide the technical details on interfacing?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The FD-8 can be connected to any micro\u0026shy;processor via a single PIA chip interface. Elec\u0026shy;tronically, there is no difficulty in interfacing to any system since transfers between the disk and the host computer are carried out via a sector buffer RAM on the disk controller card. Information transfer is under the control of a crystal clock on the controller board, thus mak\u0026shy;ing the FD-8 completely independent from processor speed or clock frequency. It is possi\u0026shy;ble to interface the FD-8 using parallel data ports without a PIA chip, however, the software for interfacing has already been written for both 8080 and 6800 systems using a PIA interface. Since some of the ports are used bi-direction\u0026shy;ally, the PIA interface provides an overall sim\u0026shy;plifi9ation of the interfacing problem. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; What software is available for 8080 sys\u0026shy;tems?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; MSI provides complete source listings and documentation for MINIDOS and the disk driver subroutines which have been written for the 8080. This allows the user to have complete access to the disk to write any desired sector or number of sectors from any desired starting location to any desired destination memory address. A complete 8080 based disk operating system is not yet available. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Is your FD-8 Floppy Disk double density?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The MSI Floppy Disk uses the GSI Model 110 drive which has the capability of operating in the double density mode. However, double density operation requires data to be written using a modified FM technique. This requires special data separator and data writing circuitry which is not contained within the present ver\u0026shy;sion of the FD-8. Double density version of the FD-8 will be introduced at a later time.\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
