What a weird system ! After their Combat Lunaire, Stellar Electronique announced a brand new and revolutionary system : Micromat, also named &amp;quot;micro-ordinateur de jeux, fonctions universelles&amp;quot;, i.e. &amp;quot;gaming micro-computer, universal fonctions&amp;quot;. What a program ! It seems to be an original mix between a check board gaming system, a micro-computer and a video-game system !!

The system uses almost the same plastic case as the Combat Lunaire system, though it is black here. There is a check board built-in the case used to play checkerboard games like tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess, etc. All moves of a game session can be saved on tape, and reloaded to finish it !

But games can also be loaded from cartridge, tape and even vinyl records ! The system can be connected to a TV to play video games, though there is a built-in display (8 digits, 14 segments)... There are sound features but specs are unknown.

Interaction is made through a knob and fire switch (button?) built-in the part of the system. There is also a 18 keys keypad next to the checkboard. Games listed in the press release were : tic-tac-toe, checker, chess, bridge, lunar landing, star war, chess, go... The system is described as &amp;quot;the first universal mini-computer of great power mainly aimed at games&amp;quot;.

It is not clear if this system was ever released, but it was for sure a very original and interesting object !
