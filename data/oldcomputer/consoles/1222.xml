This console is only a prototype designed in 1980 by designer Iain Sinclair for Promotors Ltd based in Hong-Kong. It's unclear if this particular model has ever been produced or not, but chances are not.

What is striking is the ressemblance between this prototype and Emerson Arcadia 2001 or Interton VC-4000 compatible systems: two detachable controllers made of a keypad and an analog joystick, several buttons on the control panel...

But the most obvious hint is that all these obscure clone systems were also made in Asia and mainly in Hong-Kong. It sounds like this Palladium Game Console was one of those systems intended to be sold worldwide under different brand names.

The name of this system is not to be confused with German company Palladium which also marketed an Arcadia 2001 clone, the Palladium Video-Computer-Game. Or are both systems linked in any way?

Thanks to Iain Sinclair Design for the pictures.
