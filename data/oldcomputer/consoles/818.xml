Though this it looks like a common European pong system, the Poppy 9017 is quite particular for it offers 4 pongs games, 2 shooting games AND 4 motor cycle games in the same case... wow

The 4 classic pongs games (Tennis, Soccer, Squash, Practice) and 2 shooting games (Moving target, S.L. Target) are almost certainly offered by the General Instrument AY-3-8512 chipset. The shooting games are only playable with the optional light gun. The 4 motor cycle games (Drag race, Stunt Cycle, Motor Cross, Enduro) are powered by the General Instruments AY-3-8760 chipset. This two GI chipsets are used in this system, which is quite unsual

While the 6 pong games are selected with a knob, the 4 motor cycle games are selected through 4 buttons. Seven swicthes offer the folowing functions: Serve (auto/manu), Ball angle (20&amp;deg;, 60&amp;deg;), Ball speed (high/low), Bat size (small/large), Cycle (hard/easy), Power (on/off) and Game type (Paddle/Rifle or Cycle). The two detachable paddles have no fire button...

The Tele-Partner Model G is the same system.
