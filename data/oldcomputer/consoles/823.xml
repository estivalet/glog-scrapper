Though different in shape, the ITMC SD-290 is internaly the same system as the Rollet Video-Color and the Hanimex HMG-7900. The SD-290 model was sold in France by ITMC, but could also be found under the Jou&amp;eacute;Club brand (Jou&amp;eacute;CLub SD-290)...

All these systems were surely produced by Soundic in Hong-Kong as they have code-names like &amp;quot;SD-2xx&amp;quot; (where SD would mean Soundic) on their electronic boards. These SD-2xx systems were not very powerful as even the Videopac systems were better... 5 years earlier!! 

What is strange about these consoles, is that there are not clones of famous systems... The only system which is quite close in many points, though more powerful, is the japanese Cassette Vision from Epoch. The games plastic boxes are the same and the blocky graphics are very similar...

The ITMC SD-290 is square shaped, the case is white and blue colored with orange buttons and controls. It was delivered with only one controller which connects to the left side of the system. There is a second connector (on the right side of the system) for a second player controller, but as all the games were for one player only, it was never used. The controller can be stored in its compartment located on the top of the console. It is composed of a 4-directions disc on which can be screwed a little stick. There is also a knob for Breakout-type games and an orange fire button.

The control panel is made of three buttons and an on/off switch. The buttons are RESET, GAME SELECT and GAME START. GAME SELECT is used to select the different levels and options of the game.

The cartridge slot, protected by a trap door, is made of 22 pins and is placed at the top-left part of the console, just above the joystick storage compartment. Like on the HMG-7900, the case is labeled &amp;quot;Programmable Color Video Game&amp;quot;.

Inside, the main chipset is a NEC D779C 300. Almost nothing is known about it. Hopefully Richard Gellman wrote to tell us more:

I did some searching on various internet resources to try and find out about the D779C CPU chipset. It seems to be completely obscure, and restricted to the ITMC SD-290.

NEC were known for cloning other CPUS; The D780C was a clone of the Z80. The D779C appears to be more a &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; chip, like a microcontroller. It may be a custom-made Z80 MCU with certain features removed for cost.

Unfortunately, as there is no information available I can not confirm this, so this is a &amp;quot;best educated guess&amp;quot;.

The games are very simple and cover the great classics such as Space Invaders, Breakout, Missile Attack or Pac-Man (delivered with the system). But graphics, even in 8 colors, are poor. Concerning the PAC-MAN cover for example, all you can see is squares running after a cross... wow, that is almost virtual reality!

There was a total of 11 cartridges produced, though 5 more cartridges, for two players this time, were planned but never released (someone can confirm this?). These cartridges were: Football, Ski, Ice-skating (!), Car-Race and Tennis.
