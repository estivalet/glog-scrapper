This pong is one of the many Binatone systems. As its name indicates, it offers 8 games. In order to understand how this system fits into the Binatone pong range, here is simplified list of the systems : 

TV Master MK IV
TV Master 4 plus 2
TV Master MK 6
TV Master MK 8
TV Master MK 10

Colour TV Game
Colour TV Game 4 plus 2
Colour TV Game MK 6
Colour TV Game MK 10

The first serie, TV Master systems, are all black &amp;amp; white pongs, whereas later Colour TV games have colour display. There do not seem to be an equivalent of the TV master MK 8 in the Colour TV Game serie (8 games); mostly because there were no pong-in-a-chip chipset offering 8 colour games available.

Game selection is made through a big rotating knob placed at the centre of the system case. The two detachable analog joysticks can be stored in slide-in compartments located on both sides of the case. The shape of this plastic case is fairly common and many pongs could be found with the same design.

This system seems to be powered by a General Instruments AY-3-8600 chipset(anyone can confirm ?).
