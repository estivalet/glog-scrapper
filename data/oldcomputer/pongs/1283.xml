The Odyssey 500 was released in 1976, and was very advanced for that time considering the technology used. It was in fact the only system of its kind. As a matter of fact, the white paddles representing the players were replaced by simple color graphics: two tennis players with their rackets (TENNIS game), two squash players (SMASH &amp;amp; SOCCER?), or two hockey players holding their sticks (HOCKEY).

On the control panel, one can find two switches: one to select the playfield (a wall on the left, a central net or two walls with goals), and the other one to select player graphics (as described above). That's why the box claims there is a fourth game, Soccer. It's in fact a combination of the &amp;quot;hockey&amp;quot; playfield and &amp;quot;smash&amp;quot; player graphics!

Promotional text from the box:
- Works on any TV... color or black &amp;amp; white 
- Digital on-screen scoring - displays each player's score 
- Action sound - for game realism 
- Vertical, horizontal, speed &amp;amp; English controls - for exciting action 
- Automatic serve - adds greater challenge to each game 
- Full color playing fields &amp;amp; players - Only when used with a color TV 
- AC adapter included - for economical, battery-free use
- New All-Pro:  Smash, Hockey, Tennis &amp;amp; Soccer

There are three different playfield (smash, tennis and hockey) and three different player graphics. That's why the box says there is also a Soccer game! It's in fact the hockey game with the Smash player graphics...&amp;lt;</description>
