  "description": "\nOne really nice and odd pong system. It also was sometimes distributed under the Alcatel label. It was sold in a brown suitcase so you could carry it easily and anywhere. In the upper part of the suitcase is stored the lightgun.\n\nThe buttons are very original and very cool to press (hehe, you can\u0027t imagine the feeling...). You can use the magnets sold with the system to keep the score by placing them on the sides of the metallic panel where numbered squares are drawned.\n\nIt is quite difficult to know which chip this system uses because it is very hard to open ! But there are two special options built-in the system which are quite uncommon :\n\n- A new game called Hockey Handicap. It\u0027s a classic hockey game where there\u0027s a third bat for one of the players.\n\n- Is also included in the system a robot option that allows a single player to play vs the system in 4 games (Tennis, Hockey, Handicap Hockey and Squash)\n\nA definitely nice looking pong with original graphic designs !\n \n\n\n",
