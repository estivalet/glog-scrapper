  "description": "\nThis pong is one of the many Binatone systems. As its name indicates, it offers 10 games : 8 pong games (basket 1, basket 2, gridball, squash 1, squash 2, football, tennis, ice hockey) and 2 shooting games (target 1, target 2). It is the last Binatone pong marketed and the most evoluated one.\n\nGame selection is made through 10 individual push buttons. The two detachable controllers are composed of an analog joystick and a fire button. They can be stored in slide-in compartments located on both sides of the case. The shape of this plastic case is fairly common and many pongs can be found with the same design.\n\nInterestingly enough, both shooting games are not played with a light gun but directly with the analog joysticks.\n\nThis system seems to be powered by a General Instruments AY-3-8610 chipset, which equiped a lot of other pong systems (anyone can confirm ?).\n\nHere are some interesting promoting texts:\n10 separate push buttons for game selection. Games include football, ice hockey, gridball, basketball solo, basketball, tennis, squash, squash solo, plus 2 built in remote control shooting games. \u0027Joystick\u0027 hand controls for X-Y movement. Automatic on-screen scoring. Scores colour keyed for each player. Built-in push button firing device for shooting games. Different authentic sounds for hit, rebound and score. Selectable fast and slow ball speeds for professional and amateur ratings. Bat sizes separately adjustable for left and right players allowing for handicap situations. Selectable auto and manual service. Suitable for use on most sizes and brands of colour or black and white UHF TVs.\n\n \n\n\n",

Simple-to-build, simple-to-operate. But a really powerful full-facility computer. And designed on an expandable basis. You can buy a superb expanded package now-tailored to your needs. Or, you can buy just the standard Atom kit, and, as you grow in confidence and knowledge, add more chips. No need to replace your equipment. No need to worry that your investment will be overtaken by new technology. As you need more power, more facilities, you can add them! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The standard ATOM kit includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Full sized QWERTY keyboard. Rugged polystyrene case\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Fibreglass PCB. 2K RAM. 8K ROM. 23 integrated circuits . Full assembly instructions including tests for fault-finding. (Once built, connect it to any domestic TV and power source)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; . Power requirement: 8V at 800 M A. ATOM power unit available.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; PLUS FREE MANUAL written in two sections \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; - teach yourself BASIC and machine code for those with no knowledge of computers, and a reference section giving a complete description of the ATOM\u0027s facilities. All sections are fully illustrated with example programs.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM concept\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Adding chips into sockets on the PCB allows you to progress in affordable steps to large-scale expansion. You can see from the specifications that the RAM can be increased to 12K allowing high resolution (256 x 192) graphics. Two further ROM chips, e.g. maths functions, can be added directly to the board giving a 16K capacity. In addition to 5 I/O lines partly used by the cassette interface, an optional VIA device can provide varied I/O and timer functions and via a buffer device allow direct printer drive. An optional module provides red, green and blue signals for colour. An in-board connector strip takes the ATOM communications loop interface. Any number of ATOMs may be tinked to each other - or to a master system with mass storage, hard copy facility. Interface with other ACORN cards is simplicity itself. Anyone ACORN card may be fitted internally. So you can see there are a vast number of modular options and additions available, expanding with your ability and your budget.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM hardware includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Memory from 2K to 12K RAM on board (up to 35K in case)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .8K to 16K ROM (two 4K additions) 86502 processor\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Video Display allows high resolution (256 x 192) graphics and red, green and blue output\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Cassette Interface-CUTS 300 baud\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Loudspeaker allows tone generation of any frequency\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Channel36 UHF Modulator Output .Bus output includes internal connections for Acorn Eurocard.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM software includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .32-bit arithmetic (+/- 2,000,000,000)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .High speed execution\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .43 standard/extended BASIC commands \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Variable length strings (up to 256 characters)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .String manipulation functions\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 32-bit integer variables\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 additional arrays\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .random number function .PUT and GET byte\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .WAIT command for timing\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .DO-UNTIL construction\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Logical operators (AND, OR, EX-OR)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .LINK to machine-code routines\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Plot draw and move. \u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Paul Durrant\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
