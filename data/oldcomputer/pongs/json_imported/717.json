  "description": "\nThis is another \u0026quot;pong-in-a-case\u0026quot; system. You can easily carry this one away to play pong anywhere you want ;-) The design is very sober, only metallic and wooden parts. It looks like it has been made by hand in very limited quantities.\n\nThe system offers the classic games of the General Instrument AY-3-8500 chipset. The game selection is made through a big knob in the middle of the system. There are also some holes made in the metalic case, to let the sound of the speaker pass through.\n \n\n\n",
