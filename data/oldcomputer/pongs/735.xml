The main feature of this pong is of course its car racing game! Few systems offered this at the time, so it was a strong commercial advantage.

We have not been able to open the system yet, so we don't know which chip it uses. It could be the F4301 from Omnetics or the AY-3-8603 from General Instruments. Can anyone confirm?
