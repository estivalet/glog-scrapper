  "description": "\nAfter the release of the Telstar (the first \u0026quot;dedicated-chip\u0026quot; pong system) in 1976 which was a big success, Coleco conceived a whole range of pongs.\n\nThis pong have the same caracteristics as the Telstar Colormatic (4 games) but the case is different. It is quite small and the controllers (dials) are built-in the console. It also has a digital pushbutton game selector, color (thanks to the AY-3-8510 chipset), and a special piezzo electric beeper (which requires an additional battery).\n\nThere\u0027s a 3 positions switch that controls difficulty (beginner : slow ball, big paddles / advanced : fast ball, big paddles / expert : fast ball, small paddles). If this is common to the first Telstars, this is quite different from most of the other pong systems which offer individual settings.\n\nPromotional text says:\n\u0026quot;Telestar Colortron, a sellout in \u002779 and still going strong! Telstar Colortron features four exciting sports games - Tennis, Hockey, Handball and Jai Alai - all in brillant color! On-screen digital display scoring, realistic electronic sound effects. Variable skill control for beginner, intermediate and pro players. The GX-10, a custom chip made for Coleco, makes it all possible at an incredibly low price!

Full color packaging.\n\n- Four exciting sports: Tennis, Hockey, Handball, Jai alai\n- Brilliant color (plays B\u0026amp;W on B\u0026amp;W TV sets)\n- On-screen digital display scoring\n- Electronic sound effects\n- Variable skill control\n- Requires two 9 volt batteries or Coleco battery eliminator / AC adapter\n- FCC approved\n- Full color packaging\n- Ages 8 to adult\u0026quot;\n \n\n\n",
