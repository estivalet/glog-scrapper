  "description": "\nThe Odyssey 500 was released in 1976, and was very advanced for that time considering the technology used. It was in fact the only system of its kind. As a matter of fact, the white paddles representing the players were replaced by simple color graphics: two tennis players with their rackets (TENNIS game), two squash players (SMASH \u0026amp; SOCCER?), or two hockey players holding their sticks (HOCKEY).\n\nOn the control panel, one can find two switches: one to select the playfield (a wall on the left, a central net or two walls with goals), and the other one to select player graphics (as described above). That\u0027s why the box claims there is a fourth game, Soccer. It\u0027s in fact a combination of the \u0026quot;hockey\u0026quot; playfield and \u0026quot;smash\u0026quot; player graphics!\n\nPromotional text from the box:\n- Works on any TV... color or black \u0026amp; white \n- Digital on-screen scoring - displays each player\u0027s score \n- Action sound - for game realism \n- Vertical, horizontal, speed \u0026amp; English controls - for exciting action \n- Automatic serve - adds greater challenge to each game \n- Full color playing fields \u0026amp; players - Only when used with a color TV \n- AC adapter included - for economical, battery-free use\n- New All-Pro:  Smash, Hockey, Tennis \u0026amp; Soccer\n\n________\n\nContributors : www.pong-story.com\nNew All-Pro:  Smash, Hockey, Tennis, \u0026amp; Soccer\n \n\n\n",

Both use the SS-50. bus architecture. However, the MSI 6800 overcomes the engineering disadvan\u0026shy;tages associated with the MIKBUG monitor, incomplete address decoding, interface ad\u0026shy;dresses in the middle of user memory, inade\u0026shy;quate power supply, and mother board capacity. The MSI 6800 system has a 20 amp power supply and a heavy duty mother board with 16 slots and gold-plated connectors. Our CPU Board has separate baud rate and system clocks, 4K of EPROM memory and a much improved MIKBUG compatible monitor. MSI interface cards bring all strappable options to a DB-25 connector on the rear panel via a rib\u0026shy;bon cable connector. This permits any terminal to be plugged into the computer without alteration of the interface card.

However, the MSI interface adapter board (IA-1) must also be used to furnish an interface bus. The MSI power supply (PS-1) may also be used to replace the SWTP supply. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Is the MSI6800 available wired and tested?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Yes, see catalog listings. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Can I use the MSI CPU card in my SWTP 6800 system in order to gain a faster system clock and on board EPROM memory?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Yes, however the MSI power supply should also be used in order to adequately supply the EPROM memory. A MIKBUG replacement monitor must also be used if interface ad\u0026shy;dresses used by MIKBUG are to be retained. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Questions About the FD-8 Disk Memory System\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; I have an SWTP 6800 System. What is needed to hook up your FD..a Floppy Disk Memory to my system?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The FD..a Disk Memory System interfaces to any microprocessor system via a single PIA chip. For the SWTP 6800 System, we furnish our PIA-1 interface card which plugs in directly to port 7 of the interface bus. A ribbon cable then plugs into the interface card and to the disk. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; What software is provided with the FD-8 Disk System?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; MSI provides a complete disk operating system software package for use with 6800 based microprocessor systems. The operating system gives the user the capability of having named files at three levels: object code files, source code files for the assembler, and BASIC files. The system contains a coresident as\u0026shy;sembler/editor which can pull source files from disk, assemble, and pass object code to either tape cassette or disk memory. Password pro\u0026shy;tection is available for both program as well as random and sequential data.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The new TSC editor is now available in a MSI FD-8 disk version. This excellent editor allows very long source files to be stored on disk, edited, and assembled with the object code being placed on disk as well.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; In BASIC, both program as well as random and sequential disk data files are available. All files are named with optional password pro\u0026shy;tection. Other basic programs on disk can be chained to or called as subroutines from a parent program. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; What charges are made for software, and what documentation do I receive?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The complete disk operating system, in\u0026shy;cluding the coresident assembler/editor are provided free of charge with the purchase of an FD..a Disk System. A $65.00 charge is made for MSI BASIC. An operating manual for disk oper\u0026shy;ating system, assembler/editor, and BASIC is provided. Partial source documentation is also provided for the input and output routines and other appropriate addresses. In addition, com\u0026shy;plete source documentation is provided for the disk driver subroutines and MINIDOS which allows the user to read or write any desired sector or number of sectors from any beginning disk location to any destination in computer memory. This enables the user to have access to the disk in his own assembly language pro\u0026shy;grams or by direct communication with the control terminal completely independently from the MSI disk operating system. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Is it possible to interface the FD-8 Floppy Disk to microcomputer systems using the 8080, Z80, or 6502 processors? If so, do you provide the technical details on interfacing?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The FD-8 can be connected to any micro\u0026shy;processor via a single PIA chip interface. Elec\u0026shy;tronically, there is no difficulty in interfacing to any system since transfers between the disk and the host computer are carried out via a sector buffer RAM on the disk controller card. Information transfer is under the control of a crystal clock on the controller board, thus mak\u0026shy;ing the FD-8 completely independent from processor speed or clock frequency. It is possi\u0026shy;ble to interface the FD-8 using parallel data ports without a PIA chip, however, the software for interfacing has already been written for both 8080 and 6800 systems using a PIA interface. Since some of the ports are used bi-direction\u0026shy;ally, the PIA interface provides an overall sim\u0026shy;plifi9ation of the interfacing problem. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; What software is available for 8080 sys\u0026shy;tems?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; MSI provides complete source listings and documentation for MINIDOS and the disk driver subroutines which have been written for the 8080. This allows the user to have complete access to the disk to write any desired sector or number of sectors from any desired starting location to any desired destination memory address. A complete 8080 based disk operating system is not yet available. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Q.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Is your FD-8 Floppy Disk double density?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;A.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; The MSI Floppy Disk uses the GSI Model 110 drive which has the capability of operating in the double density mode. However, double density operation requires data to be written using a modified FM technique. This requires special data separator and data writing circuitry which is not contained within the present ver\u0026shy;sion of the FD-8. Double density version of the FD-8 will be introduced at a later time.\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",

Simple-to-build, simple-to-operate. But a really powerful full-facility computer. And designed on an expandable basis. You can buy a superb expanded package now-tailored to your needs. Or, you can buy just the standard Atom kit, and, as you grow in confidence and knowledge, add more chips. No need to replace your equipment. No need to worry that your investment will be overtaken by new technology. As you need more power, more facilities, you can add them! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The standard ATOM kit includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .

You can see from the specifications that the RAM can be increased to 12K allowing high resolution (256 x 192) graphics. Two further ROM chips, e.g. maths functions, can be added directly to the board giving a 16K capacity. In addition to 5 I/O lines partly used by the cassette interface, an optional VIA device can provide varied I/O and timer functions and via a buffer device allow direct printer drive. An optional module provides red, green and blue signals for colour. An in-board connector strip takes the ATOM communications loop interface. Any number of ATOMs may be tinked to each other - or to a master system with mass storage, hard copy facility. Interface with other ACORN cards is simplicity itself. Anyone ACORN card may be fitted internally. So you can see there are a vast number of modular options and additions available, expanding with your ability and your budget.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM hardware includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Memory from 2K to 12K RAM on board (up to 35K in case)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .8K to 16K ROM (two 4K additions) 86502 processor\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Video Display allows high resolution (256 x 192) graphics and red, green and blue output\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Cassette Interface-CUTS 300 baud\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Loudspeaker allows tone generation of any frequency\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Channel36 UHF Modulator Output .Bus output includes internal connections for Acorn Eurocard.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;The ATOM software includes:\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .32-bit arithmetic (+/- 2,000,000,000)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .High speed execution\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .43 standard/extended BASIC commands \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Variable length strings (up to 256 characters)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .String manipulation functions\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 32-bit integer variables\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .27 additional arrays\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .random number function .PUT and GET byte\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .WAIT command for timing\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .DO-UNTIL construction\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Logical operators (AND, OR, EX-OR)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .LINK to machine-code routines\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; .Plot draw and move. \u0026lt;p class\u003d\u0026quot;petitgris\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Thanks to \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Paul Durrant\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;",
