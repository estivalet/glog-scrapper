        "Its basically a C64 like intro demo for YabYum. The original game doesn't work in ROM, doesn't work on MSX2 and higher and starting the game requires keyboard. I wanted to fix and patch that, for easy use with e.g. a Retropie with joystick without using a keyboard. Also a English translated option is available.",

        "",
        "\nWorks fine for me on all emulators. MSX hardware tested with Megaflashroms etc. (It is designed to work in ROM!! So i know it wont work on other methods).",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "\nMade in SDCC, C and ASM. The intro is ment as an parody on C64 intros, don't take it to seriously."
