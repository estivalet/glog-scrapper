        "Its basically a C64 like intro demo for YabYum. The original game doesn\u0027t work in ROM, doesn\u0027t work on MSX2 and higher and starting the game requires keyboard. I wanted to fix and patch that, for easy use with e.g. a Retropie with joystick without using a keyboard. Also a English translated option is available.",

        "\nMade in SDCC, C and ASM. The intro is ment as an parody on C64 intros, don\u0027t take it to seriously."
