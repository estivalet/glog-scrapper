The original game doesn't work in ROM, doesn't work on MSX2 and higher and starting the game requires keyboard. I wanted to fix and patch that, for easy use with e.g. a Retropie with joystick without using a keyboard. Also a English translated option is available. Works fine for me on all emulators. MSX hardware tested with Megaflashroms etc. (It is designed to work in ROM!! So i know it wont work on other methods). Made in SDCC, C and ASM. The intro is ment as an parody on C64 intros, don't take it to seriously."], "images": []}}, "publications": ["6789 visits | 122 downloads | 365 likes", "Online since Oct 11 2008 | Last update Mar 06 2018", "More in Gallery"]}
