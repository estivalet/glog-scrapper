However, it isn't a port. Like the arcade game, you play mahjong against various young attractive female opponents. However, there is no nudity in this home version. There are also extras added. A &quot;Making Mode,&quot; where you can make a character and buy accessories for her, a gallery mode where you view the art CG, and a sound test to listen to the game's vocal tracks.",
