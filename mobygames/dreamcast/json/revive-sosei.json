  "description": "<i>Revive... Sosei</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=D%c5%8dkoku+Soshite%2e%2e%2e\"> D?koku Soshite...</a>, featuring a similar story premise and gameplay. The protagonist of the game, a high-school student, finds himself and other characters (mostly female high-school students) trapped in a marine research facility. Exploring the abandoned building, the hero discovers the research staff died under mysterious circumstances. Was this a murder committed by a human being, or some sort of an unknown evil force? The hero does not have much time to think, since whatever took the lives of the scientists also threatens to murder them...<br><br>Like its predecessor, the game is a hybrid of Japanese and Western adventure styles. The player navigates the protagonist around the facility over an isometric map, entering rooms and exploring them. In many places there are traps that should be avoided, and puzzles to solve. Most puzzles involves finding and manipulating inventory items. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, and sometimes the solutions the player chooses lead to different endings. Like in many other Japanese adventures, multiple endings also depend on the protagonist's behavior towards the girls who are trapped with him. Added to <i>Revive... Sosei</i> are timed sequences, during which the player's inability to act quickly might lead to a premature end.",
