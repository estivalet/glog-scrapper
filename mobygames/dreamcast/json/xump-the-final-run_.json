  "description": "<i>Xump: The Final Run</i> is a puzzle game similar to the C64 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sensitive\">Sensitive</a>. It is not identical to the 2013 version <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Xump%3a+The+Final+Run\">of the same name</a>, which has improved graphics, new levels, music and supports more platforms.<br><br>Your goal: with your bot Xump you will have to remove all blue tiles on platforms somewhere in the sky by moving over them. A bit of planning is required, as you can move onto such a blue tile only once. The levels have a time limit, so it is required to think quickly.<br><br>Apart from the blue tiles the game also contains solid grey tiles that won't disappear, teleporters to move between two locations, dark blue tiles that have to be visited twice and arrows that will automatically push you into the arrow's direction.",
