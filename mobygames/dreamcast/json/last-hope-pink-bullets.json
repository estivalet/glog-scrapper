  "description": "This game is an updated edition of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/last-hope\">Last Hope</a>. The game is basically the same, but some modifications have been made to decrease the difficulty. This includes, for example, more levels of difficulty to choose from, and starting with a better equipped  and faster moving ship. Further, the standard enemy shots are now coloured in bright pink (thus the name of the re-release) to make them more visible, and the general colour themes of the stages have been adapted to increase the visibility, too.<br><br>",
