The two decide to elope together, fearing that nobody will accept their relationship at such a young age. However, Mizu never shows up for the meeting; a while later Hiroshi learns that she has been transferred to another school.<br><br>Several years have passed. Mizu is looking for a job and Hiroshi attends college. It looks like both have moved on with their lives. But their past catches up with them when they learn about a mysterious disappearance in the subway system.<br><br><i>Real Sound: Kaze no Regret</i> is an audio game: it has no graphics or other visuals of any kind. Gameplay-wise, it is identical to visual novels, with written text and images being replaced by sound. The player listens to the voice-acted story, which is occasionally interrupted by a chime, prompting the player to make a decision and branch the plot.",
