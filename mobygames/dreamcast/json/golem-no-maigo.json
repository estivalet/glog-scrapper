  "description": "The king has gotten lost looking for his daughter, so a golem sets out on a journey to find him and help him out. <i>The Lost Golem</i> is a puzzle game where the player must guide the king to a door in each stage by pushing walls around. Each stage is made up of walls, gates, and holes. The king will walk straight forward at all times, and turn whenever he runs into a wall. Walls will move in different ways depending on the gates they are connected to, either rotating around a gate or moving forward one space.<br><br>In addition to guiding the king to the goal, the player must also ensure that a certain number of walls are connected to a specific wall, which glows red, by the gates. If the king falls in a hole or gets squished between two walls, or if the wrong number of walls are connected at the end of the stage, the stage is lost and must be tried again.<br><br>Cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game, which tell the story in sequences of still images and text. The game also includes a stage editor where you can create your own puzzles.",
