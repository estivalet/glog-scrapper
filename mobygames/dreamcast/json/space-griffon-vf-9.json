  "description": "<i>Space Griffon VF-9</i> is a graphically enhanced version of the earlier computer game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pc98/hamlet_\">Hamlet</a>.<br><br>The largest moon base, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, has stopped responding to communication. It is up to you to determine what happened, and fix it. The game mixes typical FPS gameplay with RPG elements. You are inside a giant mech that can transform into a shape fit for walking, driving, and a mixture of both. You can move square-by-square, with 90-degree turns, slide left or right, and look up and down. By defeating enemies, the invisible RPG elements are introduced: you have hit points, energy points, and you can collect weapons and items. When an enemy approaches, this is shown through an icon, along with the distance.<br><br>The environment is claustrophobic and maze-like, and includes many enemies. The game features an unusually large amount of plot for a game of this type, mostly consisting of conversations between your teammates, who are always in other parts of the station.",
