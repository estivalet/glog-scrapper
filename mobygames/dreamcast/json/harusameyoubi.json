  "description": "It's March, and Yuu Nakagaki (?? ?) just graduated from junior high-school and is heading to a remote countryside to visit his aunt. This spring really wasn't in Yuu's favor, both in his school and love life... he failed to take an exam and he ended up with a broken heart. So this spring he ended up at his aunt's place and got a part-time job to manage the hot springs hotel called Harusame (??), Japanese for Spring Rain. Without a reason to object and looking forward to something that will take his mind off his recent events, in this small hot springs town surrounded by the sea and the mountains, his story begins. This visual novel uses text over entire dimmed background and features multiple choices during dialogues. Additionally, an area map lets you travel between locations.",
