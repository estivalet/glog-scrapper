  "description": "Inhabitants is a puzzle game that will put your skills to the test as you work your way through level after level of tile clearing action! Play with three friends in competition mode or play by yourself and unlock many new modes of play.<br><br>Inhabitants will remind you of many other popular games where you need to remove tiles of the same color, only this time there is a twist - You can only remove tiles one away from the tile you are on. The maximum tiles you can remove is therefore five, and that will give you what is known as a four-way combo.",
