  "description": "Mattel Interactive continues their Dreamcast assault with Max Steel, an action/adventure title based on the hit-rendered TV program of the same name. You control Max, a superhero with the ability to turn invisible and punch through walls, as he valiantly halts the plans of the diabolical John Dread. Gameplay is similar to Fighting Force 2, as you lead Max through expansive levels pummeling your foes with bare fists. The game also features voice-overs by the cast of the television show, adding dramatic flair to the proceedings. ",
