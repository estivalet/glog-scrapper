  "description": "It's the 25th century. Several lunar cycles have passed since Ulala saved human kind and repelled the Morolian invasion against Earth through dance. Life is quiet too quiet for Ulala until Chief Director 'Space Michael' reports that a mysterious dancing group is forcing innocent bystanders to dance and then whisking them away…Here starts another swinging report show from Ulala!<br><br>Our intergalactic anchor girl must also must take part in 'Rhythm Battles', where she takes control of a musical instrument and plays in time with her opponent and 'Lyrics Battle', where Ulala gives her singing voice a workout in order to defeat the foes that await her.<br><br>A TV channel is only as good as it's last ratings and the same is true of Space Channel 5. Ulala must keep the viewer rating high, failure to do so will lead to the show being cancelled and the plug being pulled on Space Channel 5 - Space Michael is counting on you!",
