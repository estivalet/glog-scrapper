On every turn the player chooses a card to determine how many steps to take. When all of the cards have been used the deck is reshuffled, and each player gets a new hand. While a player can see only the numbers on their own cards, and not the numbers on other players' cards, they can still choose the cards of another player.<br><br>Each board has certain tiles: blue adds 3 rings to your total; red removes 3 rings from your total and special tiles which places all of the players into a min-game or event.<br><br>The aim of the game, at the end of it all, is to get the Precioustone (1 per board).",
