  "description": "Originally released for PC (Windows) as an adult adventure game, the ports to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 removed the adult content, included a new heroine and extended the story. You play as Ryouichi Katsuragi, a young doctor and a family physician summoned to tend to an old man living in a huge mansion on the island in Italy. Upon arriving to the island in a helicopter, the game switches to 3rd-person perspective where you can freely explore the mansion and its surroundings and interact with various characters, including the mansion maids which act as heroines in this story. During 1st-person perspective mode, the game plays like a typical visual novel where you converse with other characters which are non-animated but feature voice-acting. The player choices during dialogues affect the story and key choices branch it toward a different ending. The bonus features which are accessible from the main menu are music player and unlockable heroine gallery.",
