It is the second in a series of three Capcom/Takumi shmups, between Giga Wing and Giga Wing 2.<br><br>Mars Matrix features unique gameplay based on the &quot;mosquito&quot; system. By holding down the fire button, your ship can absorb shots and then &quot;spit' them back at the enemies. Additionally, each destroyed enemy (and reflected shot) releases experience cubes of various values, which can multiplied by chaining. This experience is used to power-up your ship, and also acts as a multiplier for your score.<br><br>The Dreamcast port also includes some extra features that can be unlocked by accumulating points in the game. These features include replay videos, an image gallery, a score attack mode for perfecting individual levels, and even a complete extra game mode with a new enemy sequence.\n",
