  "description": "<i>deSpiria</i> is an RPG adventure that takes place in the futuristic Japan of 2070. Twenty-two years after the World War III, an organization known as <i>Church</i> has taken power. You play as Allure Valentine, a girl who was recruited by the Church as an undercover agent. On one of her missions, Allure boards a train that crashes shortly thereafter. Her first task will be to find a way out of the underground tunnel and to discover who or what was behind that crash.<br><br>The game is a RPG with elements of pure adventure. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, but instead of usual party you have several &quot;minds&quot;, a kind of summoned monsters who will fight together with Allure. They will heal or attack the enemy using special &quot;mind attacks&quot; of various elements - love, curse, etc. In adventure mode, you explore the environments by pressing the A button, which will highlight objects you can interact with. The movements are shown as short CG sequences, similar to many Western-style adventures.",
