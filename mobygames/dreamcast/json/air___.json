  "description": "<i>Air</i> for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 is a console port of an adult visual novel with the same name that was first released as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/air_\">Air</a> as a PC title. This port, however, reduces adult rating and removed all the sexual content, but in turn adjusts the story to those removals and adds new graphics and scenes. Additionally, it includes full voice-acting for non-playable characters (NPCs).",
