  "description": "3rd update to Street Fighter 3, Capcom's classic 2D fighter. The new version includes new music and artwork, more super arts for each character, a grading system, a manual throw system, path selection and new characters including (YES!) Chun-Li. The Dreamcast port also offers a training record option were you can record a certain move or combo and have it play against you over and over to see how you can parry it, plus a &quot;system direction&quot; option which allows you to modify practically every aspect of the game (air-blocking, combo limits, etc.) to customize it to your liking.",
