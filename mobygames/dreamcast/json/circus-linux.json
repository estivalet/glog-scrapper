  "description": "<i>Circus Linux!</i> is a clone of the Atari 2600 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/circus-atari\">Circus Atari</a>, which is in turn based on the Arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Circus\">Circus</a>. The goal of the game is to move a teeter-totter back and forth across the screen to bounce clowns up into the air. When they reach the top, they pop rows of balloons and then fall back down. Gameplay is similar to a title like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a>.",
