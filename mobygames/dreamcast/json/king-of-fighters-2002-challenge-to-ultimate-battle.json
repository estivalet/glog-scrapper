  "description": "The second plotless &quot;dream match&quot; in <i>The King of Fighters</i> series, this game sports 39 normal characters and 5 hidden characters, some of whom haven't appeared since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/king-of-fighters-98-the-slugfest\">KOF98</a>. <i>The King of Fighters 2002</i> also has five characters exclusive to the X-Box, the PS2 and/or Dreamcast systems: Shingo Yabuki, King, Geese Howard, &quot;Riot of the Blood&quot; Iori and Leopold Goenitz. Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.<br><br>The gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the &quot;Advanced system&quot; from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/king-of-fighters-97\">The King of Fighters '97</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/king-of-fighters-98-the-slugfest\">The King of Fighters '98</a>.",
