  "description": "In <i>Outtrigger</i> you play a member of the &quot;International Counter-terrorism Special Force (Interforce)&quot;, formed by &quot;Visitaria&quot;, a multi-national company for military and space products. Your goal is to defend against terrorist attacks.<br><br>You can select one of four predefined players, which differ in speed, armor and weapons, or you can create a customized character. The game itself doesn't provide any storyline, instead you can choose one of the three modes: Arcade, Mission or Versus. In all modes you find yourself in one of several small arenas after starting the game. Usually your goal is to kill a certain amount of terrorists in a limited time (or your friends in Versus mode).<br><br>The gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Quake+III\">Quake 3 Arena</a>, especially in regards to game speed and the (configurable) key assignment of the controller.",
