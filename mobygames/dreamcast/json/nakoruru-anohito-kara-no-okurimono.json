  "description": "This game tells the story of one of the characters from SNK's fighting series <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Samurai+Spirits\">Samurai Spirits</a>: the girl Nakoruru. She comes from Kamuikotan, a small village on Japan's most northern island, Hokkaido, which is populated by Ainu, a nation with its own culture and traditions. The time of the game is set somewhere between the fighting tournaments where Nakoruru participates. She comes back to her home village, but the village elder sense evil, and her friends are worried about her. This is where Mikato, a little girl who was told by the village elder to keep an eye on Nakoruru, enters the picture. The relationship between Mikato, Nakoruru, and other village inhabitants form the core of the game's story.<br><br><i>Nakoruru: Anohito kara no Okurimono</i> is a visual novel. The player listens to the dialogues between Mikato and other people, and reads her thoughts about what is happening. From time to time the player will have to choose one of two or more available options which will lead to different dialogue or scenes. There are also some simple mini-games (such as for example playing a melody on a musical instrument).",
