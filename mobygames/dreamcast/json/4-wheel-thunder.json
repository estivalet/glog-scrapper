  "description": "<i>4 Wheel Thunder</i> is the off-road racing sequel to the power-boat racing game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hydro-thunder\">Hydro Thunder</a>. <br><br>In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night and rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and two player modes.<br><br>The <i>Thunder</i> series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, instead focusing more in finding the boost power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of the truck dramatically. Without using boost power-ups, the player has no chance of winning a race.",
