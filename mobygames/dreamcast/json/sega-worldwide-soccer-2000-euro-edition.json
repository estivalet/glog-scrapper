  "description": "This game is an upgrade to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-worldwide-soccer-2000\">Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000</a>, with an improved graphical engine and the possibility to let you play the Euro 2000 celebrated in Holland and Belgium. Other available game modes are the World Cup (where you could compete as any of the 64 best teams in the world), National leagues (Italian, Spanish, English, German, Japanese, etc), International leagues and friendly match. Regarding player licenses, this game takes the same position as World League Soccer 98; that is, player names will resemble those of their real life counterparts, but will not be exactly the same (although curiously, game commentators will pronounce them correctly).",
