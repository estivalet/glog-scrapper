  "description": "The creators of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/street-fighter\">Street Fighter</a> add a new dimension to 3D fighting. In <i>Power Stone</i>, two fighters take to multi-level arenas with Power Stones and other weapons lying around for use.<br><br>Each game contains Power Stones. When you have enough stones (between three to five), your character transforms into an almost unbeatable warrior, with an all-new range of moves (although this does not last for long).",
