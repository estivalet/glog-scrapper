  "description": "<i>Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition</i> is the third game in the <i>Runabout</i> series. The player can drive around San Francisco, crashing into objects.  There are two  scenarios: Scenario A places the player in control of San Francisco Motors, a kind of &quot;messenger/delivery/bomb disposal service&quot; rolled up in one, while Scenario B has the player controlling laid-back San Francisco police officers. The two scenarios have different missions, whether it's stopping a runaway cable car, or collecting bombs for disposal.",
