  "description": "<i>Kaze no Uta</i> (aka <i>Song of the Wind</i>) is a visual novel erotic adventure game with explicit content. The story takes place in a small rural area around the seaside town called Sakuragi-cho. The protagonist returns from Tokyo to spend the summer in a town which brings him a lot of nostalgic memories. But after being absent for so long, unaware about the current events in the town, the summer vacations may not be so carefree and relaxing as you expect them to be.<br><br>The Dreamcast port was release two years after initial Windows release, and is adjusted for consoles as it removes all the adult content. It adds however new CG events to the gameplay and also includes bonus drama disc. There is also a DVD-Player game release which is more similar to the original game and features all the adult content.",
