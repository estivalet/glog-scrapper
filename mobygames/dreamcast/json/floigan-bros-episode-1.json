  "description": "Hoigle and Moigle Floigan are brothers who live in a junkyard.  Hoigle is the elder of the two. He's also the smaller of the two, and by far the smarter.  In this game you control Hoigle as he helps his large but slow-witted younger brother Moigle to build a secret invention.<br><br><i>Floigan Bros.</i> is an action puzzle game with a strong emphasis on cooperation. Hoigle must work with Moigle to accomplish many tasks. Moigle, on the other hand, is more frequently interested in playing games or eating. By playing with Moigle, Hoigle can eventually teach him the skills he needs to get the job done.<br><br>The game featured some online content that was downloadable using the Dreamcast's built-in modem.
