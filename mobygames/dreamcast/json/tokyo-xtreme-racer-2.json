  "description": "The second of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tokyo+Xtreme+Racer+series\">Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s</a> to appear on the Dreamcast is nearly identical to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tokyo+Xtreme+Racer\">the first one</a> gameplay-wise. Once again, there is no specific start, or finish lines, it all depends on how well you drive, and how fast. This time around, there are more opponents to beat, roughly 120, and plenty of new cars to choose in your quest.<br><br>Like other installments in the series, <i>TXR 2</i> implements a system found most commonly in fighting games, where each player has a life bar and the player with remaining life wins the race. Different factors can cause the life bar of a player to deplete, include hitting into objects, other cars, or just simply falling behind the lead car.<br><br>",
