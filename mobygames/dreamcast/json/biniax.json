  "description": "<i>Biniax</i> is a very simple arcade/logic game with unique gameplay features.<br><br>The gaming field is a 5x7 grid, filled partially with pairs of elements. Every pair consists of two different elements combined of four possible. You control the box with an element inside. You can move around the field on empty spaces. You can also remove pairs of elements, if you have the same element as the one of the pair. When you remove the pair, your element becomes the other element of the pair and the score is increased. The gaming field scrolls down and your goal is to stay as long as possible on the field. At the last line, if you can't take the pair in front of you, the scrolling will move your block out and the game will end.",
