  "description": "You awaken one day after a prolonged sleep, look around and realize you have been asleep for quite a while - thousands of years... The people who saw you during your sleep named you the Sleeper. You were discovered by an archaeological team, and an ancient machine, which was dubbed &quot;Elemental Gimmick Gear&quot; by the archaeologists, was found near you. Players take the control of the Sleeper, who has no memory of who he really is and what he had been doing before he awakened. Having awakened from a very long sleep, the Sleeper sets out to discover his past, stop the contamination of the planet which is caused by Fogna: the mysterious ruins he was found in, as well as find out the purpose of the mysterious Elemental Gimmick Gear.<br><br>This game is an Action RPG with a lot of emphasis on puzzle-solving. The player can move around the battlefield, using various physical attacks, such as punching, extending the arm or spinning. Players will also unlock elemental (magic-like) attacks which will be useful for longer range attacks, finding secret areas with capsules and solving some of the game's puzzles. In total, there are 4 types of elements to unlock with some of the skills utilizing multiple elements.<br><br>There is no leveling up in this game. Thus, improving stats is done by either collecting 3 capsules of 3 different types (Attack, Defense or Mind) or an Energy Tank which will increase the Sleeper's max HP.<br><br>The game is mostly 2D, featuring hand drawn backgrounds. However, during boss battles and in the spin racing mini-game, the game switches into a 3D mode.<br><br>There are also a few mini-games included within the game, such as a 3D spin racing game and a few missions which involve spinning, activating switches and collecting as many points as possible while reaching the finish line before time runs out.<br><br>Also, while traveling, players can find and gather Metamos: small creatures that can be raised by feeding them with elements. These creatures, after having grown, can be interacted with to restore or lose health and elements, as well as gain more capsules. ",
