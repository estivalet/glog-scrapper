  "description": "<i>Omoide ni Kawaru Kimi</i> is the third main game in the series. The protagonist of the story is Shougo Kaga, who enrolled in a college for no particular goal. He is somewhat lazy and instead of diligent studying he spends his time leisurely and playing. Aimlessly spending his days as it were, he started feeling vaguely depressed. This brooding mood started a couple of years ago when his girlfriend, Kanata Kurosu, suddenly disappeared without saying a word. She left him heartbroken and without a reason why she ran off. A couple of years later, the two of them meet by chance at a cafe Shougo was frequently visiting.<br><br>On par with previous two main titles in <i>Memories Off</i> series, player affects the story by selecting different choices and different girls he wants to be with.",
