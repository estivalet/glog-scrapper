  "description": "<i>Prismaticallization</i> is a romantic visual novel adventure game keeping the player trapped in the same that constantly repeats itself. While the goal is to get close to various girls and get together with the girl you like, unless you find a way to break the time loop, after the day resets you will have to do the wooing all over again, which may be play if you decide to go for a different girl. The game is a typical visual novel game which uses static 2D anime style characters over background which is comprised in small portion of an artwork showing the location while majority is the window frame itself with dialogue window pasted over the character you are talking to.",
