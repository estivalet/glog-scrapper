  "description": "<i>Vampire Chronicle For Matching Service</i> is a 2D versus fighting game by Capcom, done in the same style as the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/street-fighter\">Street Fighter</a> series. The game uses the CPS-2 system - the same as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=street+fighter+alpha\">Street Fighter Alpha</a> series, which makes the gameplay of these two titles very similar.<br><br>The game is also an installment in the Darkstalkers franchise, presenting a collection of all eighteen characters and four different play modes available in the series. Like in the previous games, the playable characters are monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.",
