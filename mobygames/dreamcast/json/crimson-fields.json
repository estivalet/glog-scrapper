A level editor is also included to create custom maps and campaigns.<br><br>The game comes with a tutorial, a full campaign and several individual maps, offering a wide range of multiplayer and network options.  The gameplay mimics very closely the style of the original, where two players, human or computer-controlled, take turns moving military units on a map with hexagonal tiles for the terrain, trying to take hold of resources and buildings while eliminating the opposition. Map objectives are usually displayed as a briefing text at the beginning of a new game. The text can be changed from the default English to German, Polish, French and other languages.",
