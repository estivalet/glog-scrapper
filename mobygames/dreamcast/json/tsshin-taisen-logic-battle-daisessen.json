  "description": "An island in the sky, Shunkashu Island, is a place of everlasting spring where people live peacefully together with androids and spirits. But recently, snow has started to fall on Shunkashu Island. It must be the work of the Snow Family, but what reason would they have to do such a thing? Spring must return to Shunkashu Island, and for that reason the fight is beginning: The Great Snow War.<br><br><i>Daisessen</i> is a strategy game very similar to the board game classic <i>Battleship</i>. Two players arrange soldiers on a grid, then take turns firing at the other team, attempting to destroy their forces first. The game has a story mode and a 2-player versus mode, and also supported online play.",
