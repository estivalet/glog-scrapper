  "description": "In <i>Fushigi no Dungeon: Furai no Shiren Gaiden - Jokenji Asuka Kenzan!</i> a female swordsman called Asuka (who had previously fought beside Shiren the Wanderer) travels with her weasel companion Coppa to save the lands from the corrupted Koga Ninja army and the monster Hachimaten. Along the way she meets a ninja called Minamo. The player will navigate through some randomly generated dungeons. As they progress, Asuka may acquire better swords and shields along the way, which can also be modified for better combat performance. There is also the mechanic that allows breeding monsters to aid Asuka in battles.",
