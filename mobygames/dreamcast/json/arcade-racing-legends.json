  "description": "<i>Arcade Racing Legends</i> is a homebrew arcade racing game, developed as a reminiscene of many classical <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=SEGA+Corporation\">SEGA</a> games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/crazy-taxi\">Crazy Taxi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/outrun\">Outrun</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-rally-2-championship\">SEGA Rally</a> - therefore a lot of cars and tracks pick up elements from those games. In total there are 7 different tracks, ranging from Desert tracks over an underwater course to a neon-colored city at night, and 24 different cars.<br><br>The game features several game modes: A &quot;Career&quot; mode with 18 different tasks (beating a given time, not touching the banks, or winning a race against computer opponents), an &quot;Arcade&quot; mode to just race against other AI players and a &quot;Time Trial&quot; mode to beat the best time and race against a ghost. The game also supports splitscreen multiplayer (called &quot;Duel&quot;) for two players. New tracks in Arcade mode have to be unlocked by finishing the previous track first place against the CPU.",
