  "description": "<i>WWF Attitude</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/wwf-war-zone\">WWF War Zone</a>. The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, including a variety of game modes and specialty matches, such as Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, Tornado matches, and others. The Create-A-Wrestler mode has been slightly enhanced, adding commentary and crowd chants responding to the superstars' nicknames. The Challenge Mode of the previous game is replaced by the Career Mode, allowing the player-controlled wrestler to participate in house shows, winning matches to work his way up to the prestigious Raw show, pay-per-view events, and eventually compete for the title. A few new match types and fall superstar entrances have also been added. <br><br>New game modes include Create-A-Stable and a Pay-Per-View mode, which allows the player to set up an own wrestling event. The game includes an option to customize arenas, editing the color of lights, ropes, turnbuckles, logos etc.",
