  "description": "Vertical shoot-em-up ported from the Naomi Arcade version. Ikaruga is more or less a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/radiant-silvergun\">Radiant Silvergun</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Treasure\">Treasure</a>, on the Sega Saturn.<br><br>Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black &amp; white sides of his ship during gameplay.\nThe black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it considers as a bonus, and dies on impact with white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damage white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties make a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. <br><br>This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.",
