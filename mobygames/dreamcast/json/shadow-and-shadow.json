  "description": "The year is Kanei 17, a dark time of thoughtless violence, where the fires of civil war still burn. Drifting in this world is a lone swordsman: Sougen, the swordsman with two shadows. Forever an outcast, he ends up on an infamous island known as Awashima, home to strange demons and unexplained events. This island may hold the secret to Sougen's curse, but can he find the answer and make it out with his life?<br><br><i>Nijyuei</i> (Double Shadow) is a standard Japanese-style erotic adventure game: read the story, occasionally making decisions, and watch as events play out. As with most conversions of this kind, the console versions removed the adult content. As the game takes place in what is described as a realistic historic setting, it features the &quot;Phrase Instruction System&quot; which will explain events and vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to a modern-day player. The game also includes a CG mode where previously-seen events can be viewed.",
