  "description": "<i>Okaeri!</i> (??????) is a visual novel romance adventure following the story of Youhei Oohira, a third year college student living alone in Tokyo. One summer, he returns to Himegima island for his teaching practice. On the ferry to the island he runs into his childhood friend, Nagisa Shinohara, who gets agitated by the fact that he didn't recognize her. While on the island, Youhei meets other characters, mainly girls, where this story of love and friendship begins.<br><br>The game features full voice-acting for heroines and other key characters (Nagisa, Mio, Akira, Hikaru, Nami, and others), and actual photo stills (though processed a bit) for background images, while CG events feature anime style background artwork. Character art is using typical anime style with no animation but only difference in still poses. During the gameplay, current time of day and location are being displayed, while everything, along with dialogue window, can be toggled off in order to see the clear and unobscured background image.",
