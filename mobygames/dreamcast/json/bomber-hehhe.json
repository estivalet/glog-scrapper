  "description": "This puzzle simulation tasks players with running a demolition crew. In each stage, players are given a set number of charges and can then navigate through a 3D floor plan, setting charges wherever they want. After setting their charges, the game simulates the building's collapse and players are scored based on how successful their job was. If players do well enough, they can move on to the next stage, but if they do badly enough their botched demolition might just make the evening news.",
