  "description": "<i>Gem Drop X</i> is a fast-paced puzzle game where screens of gems need to be cleared before they reach the bottom. This release is a port of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=GemDrop\">GemDrop</a> for the Atari 8-bit, which in turn is inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/magical-drop-iii\">Magical Drop III</a>.<br><br>You move a character left or right and grab up to ten gems of the same color from the ones at the top and use them to knock more gems off the screen by launching them. Match three or more of the same color in a column and they explode. Any adjacent gems of the same color also explode, causing a chain reaction that might cover the entire screen. The more gems that disappear with one shot, the higher the score you get.",
