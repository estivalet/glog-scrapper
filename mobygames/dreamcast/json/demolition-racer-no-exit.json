  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/demolition-racer\"> Demolition Racer</a>. Race 14 tortuous tracks with mines and crates all over the place slowing you down, racing over 16 savage cars to a sports car to a hearse with its own characteristics to win the race. New game mode &quot;last man standing&quot; where you face all cars in race not for position, but to wreck each other going down a track to see who's last, and &quot;demolition derby&quot; where you fight cars in a arena to see who's last by hitting each other with state-of-the-art graphics where you can see tires, doors, hoods, bumpers, etc. go everywhere.
