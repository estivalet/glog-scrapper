  "description": "In <i>Milky Season</i>, the player controls a young student who got appointed as the head of the girls' dormitory. This, in turn, will put you into many awkward and romantic situations where you can select how the story will branch and which girl you may fall in love with, based on your choices during dialogues. <i>Milky Season</i> is a visual novel that originated on consoles (PlayStation and Dreamcast), and is not a PC port and as such had no adult elements to begin with, focusing more on the story and interaction with the characters in this slice-of-life sort of setting.<br><br>The game features twelve heroines, letting you check the affection of 8 possible love interests towards you at any point during the game. The game does not feature any animation and characters depict their attitude and disposition only in voice-acting and static poses. Typical visual novel elements are present during gameplay, such as the dialogue text can be toggled to see the clear background, or that your choices may lead you towards a certain path in the story. The twelve heroines you can interact with in the game are: Miki Ayase, Saori Nonohana, Marin Chiura, Chihaya Hoshinami, Yun Usami, Reika Ranzaki, Mio Ayase, Itsuki Fujiwara, Mashiro Tachibana, Urumi Morishita, Kasumi Shindou, and Sachie Tohyama.",
