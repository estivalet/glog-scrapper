The game settings consist of an actual world which is set around the village Takumi lives in, and a virtual world which can be accessed using special bed-like terminals. One day, a girl on a motorcycle crashes into his house, leaving the hole in the wall. As chance has it, she'll need to stay until she fixes her bike and make it mobile again so she can get back on the road and see the world.
