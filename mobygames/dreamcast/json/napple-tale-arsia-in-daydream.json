  "description": "The player controls Arsia, a young girl, wandering around Napple town and levels themed around the four seasons. To restore peace, Arsia and her pet creatures will have to collect six &quot;petals&quot;. <br><br>Although the game is primarily a platform game, there are many people to talk to and a complete story accompanying the action. Exploration parts mainly develop in Napple with a third person view, while the platformer levels, the four seasons, gets a 2D side-scrolling camera. In side-scrolling levels, Arsia usually has to complete the level and fight against a boss. Several levels requires certain items or people to talk to, meaning that the player might need to revisit some levels several times to go on with the quest.<br><br>The game setting is influenced by European fairy tale tradition, with classical cartoon-looking characters (somewhat reminding of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Alice+in+Wonderland\">Alice in Wonderland</a>) and colored houses. For example, Pierrot the clown, talking trees, and a cow barman appear in the game.<br><br><i>Napple Tale</i> also offers micro-management with pets, items, and a complex process to create new creatures or items by combining several of them in various ways (similar to the store in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/power-stone-2\">Power Stone 2</a> or all games of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Atelier\">Atelier</a> series). The player can also be carried out collecting all cards and be sure that he or she has seen everything in the game.\n",
