  "description": "Tweedy's Farm is home to a bunch of chickens, who are falling behind on their work load (laying eggs). So Mrs Tweedy decides to go into a new business, Chicken Pie making. The chickens leader, Ginger, is in desperate need of a good escape plan, and when Rocky flys in from the US to lend them a hand, the gang decide that the only way out of the farm is to fly out. But of course, chickens can't fly!! So it is up to you to collect the pieces for the flying machine so you and your fellow chickens can escape.",
