  "description": "In 1989, 12 years after the Gogoh army attempted to invade Earth in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/supercharged-robot-vulkaiser\">Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser</a>, the terrorist organization &quot;Neo Loran Order&quot; threatens the world as it fights for world domination. It's up to the newly formed Earth Federation's mech army to defeat the Neo Loran Order and take out their secret super weapon, known only by its code name &quot;Armed Seven&quot;.<br><br><i>Armed Seven</i> is a horizontally scrolling mech shoot 'em up. When starting the game, you get to choose a main weapon, sub weapon and charge weapon out of a selection of four each. Your main weapon can be aimed freely in an 180º arc, while your sub weapon fires in a fixed direction depending on the weapon chosen. The charge weapon is a powerful attack which has to be rested between uses.\nShooting down supply ships will drop shield and weapon powerups. The shield can absorb up to two hits, if your health runs to zero it's game over. You have a limited number of continues, which lets you restart at the beginning of the stage with reset weapon level and score.",
