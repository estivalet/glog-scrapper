  "description": "<i>Puyo Puyo Da!</i> is a rhythm-action game set in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a> universe. The main characters of the series decide to take a break from all the spellcasting and puyo catching by competing against each other in a series of dance-offs.<br><br>Each player receives a sequence of controller motions and tries to perform said sequence matching the graphic and audio cues that play out. Success increases your health bar, but if you fail you run the risk of getting beaten by your opponent.<br><br>Graphics are completely 3D for the first time in a Puyo Puyo game,  featuring fully polygonal models of each character as they dance in sync with the music, composed of an assorted variety of J-Pop tunes.",
