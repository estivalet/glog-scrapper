  "description": "<i>Captain Tomaday</i> is a 2D vertical scrolling &quot;cute'em up&quot;. Main hero is Captain Tomaday - a mutant cherry tomato with hands and feet (like Rayman). Fists are his main weapon - the Captain can &quot;throw&quot; them in enemies. He can also charge his hand-attack (by using second hand several times). The rest is typical - he flies forward, eliminates enemies, and collects various bonuses.",
