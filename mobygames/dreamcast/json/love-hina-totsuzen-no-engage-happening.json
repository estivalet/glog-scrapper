  "description": "<i>Love Hina: Totsuzen no Engage Happening</i> is an adventure game based on the Love Hina anime. It still revolves around Keitaro managing a house full of girls while trying to study for an entrance exam to a university he set his mind on some time ago. Naturally, distractions are plentiful and he will have his hands full. The game features original story from the franchise, and plays as an adventure visual novel with a rather original gameplay system. While you control your character through an isometric perspective, and talk to characters in a visual novel style by displaying their portraits over current background with full voice-overs for heroines during dialogues, dialogue and action choices are replaced with a command roulette system which requires good reflexes to select the wanted outcome.",
