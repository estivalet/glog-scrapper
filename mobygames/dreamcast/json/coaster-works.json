  "description": "<i>Coaster Works</i> puts the player in the role of a roller coaster engineer, recently hired to help construct several different roller coasters for different amusement parks.<br><br>The construction part is set up with a screen divided in four camera angles and a grid based building tool. Using vector pieces, the player has to make a roller coaster that meets the requirements of the specific park. The pieces can be tilted, elevated, lowered and turned to make sure the ride is as exciting as possible.<br><br>After the roller coaster is done it will be tested with a crash test dummy (who's also able to squeal like an excited kid), to make sure it meets such requirements as safety, speed, excitement etc. This is done in a 1st person view, allowing the player to come along for the ride as well.<br><br>There are 6 different stages, each with different sizes and limitations.",
