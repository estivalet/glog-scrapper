  "description": "This open-source, freeware remake of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/abu-simbel-profanation\">Spanish platform game</a> from 1985 replaces the graphics and sounds with new enhanced assets, while maintaining the same unforgiving gameplay of the original. The player controls Johnny Jones, an archaeologist deformed by an Egyptian curse after desecrating the tomb of a Pharaoh. Since the main character is unarmed and only capable of walking and jumping, the goal is to carefully explore all the maze-like rooms of the Abu Simbel temple complex, each filled with dangerous enemies to be avoided and obstacles that must be navigated to reach the inner chambers.<br><br>Besides the regular binaries developed with Allegro libraries, a pure Java version is also available to theoretically run on anything that supports it. The game language can be set to English, Spanish, French and German.",
