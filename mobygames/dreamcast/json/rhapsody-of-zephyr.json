  "description": "<i>Rhapsody of Zephyr</i> is a Korean-made role-playing game and a side-story in <i>The War of Genesis</i> series.  Unlike most other installments of the series, it has less tactical elements and is more close to the traditional Japanese-style RPG format.<br><br>The story of the game is loosely based on Alexandre Dumas' famous novel <i>The Count of Monte-Cristo</i>. The game is set in a pseudo-European New Age environment (17th -19th centuries). The hero of the game, a young nobleman Cyrano Bernstein, is betrayed by his fiancee Mercedes and is captured by the evil warlock Cesare Borgia. After fleeing from the prison, Cyrano swears revenge, and sets off to find a legendary sword sealed on a nearby island and to recruit allies in order to get involved in a war between two powerful empires.<br><br>The game features turn-based tactical combat, which allows the player to move the characters on the battlefield. The player can use a variety of magic spells, recruit townspeople to help the protagonists in battles, and have special statistics for weapons, which have their own HP and can be damaged and destroyed in battles.",
