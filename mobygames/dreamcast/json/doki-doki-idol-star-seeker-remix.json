  "description": "<i>Idol Star Seeker Remix</i> is the first independent release from developer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=G%2erev+Ltd\">G.rev Ltd.</a>, the game differs quite a bit from the company's later games. It's a fast-paced puzzle game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Minesweeper\">Minesweeper</a> and is played on a hexagonal grid. The title was undertaken on a short development cycle and budget, but tried to compensate for these flaws through using the appeal of well-endowed anime girls in provocative poses.",
