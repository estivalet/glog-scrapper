  "description": "Pick the warrior, thief, or wizard, and fight through five huge levels, each with  its own boss. Your main weapons are your fists, but you can pull out weapons for quick kills. You only get so many shots with your weapon before it breaks, though.<br><br>Gameplay is basic 3D brawling. You will be attacked by one or more enemies, and will need to defend yourself, and attack back. The game features arcade and adventure modes. In the arcade mode, the levels are timed, and you only get 5 lives but you are revived where you died. In adventure mode, you get unlimited retries of each level, but must complete each level on a single life.<br><br>Note that your objective in each level is to kill every enemy; since the levels have multiple paths, you will need to backtrack often.",
