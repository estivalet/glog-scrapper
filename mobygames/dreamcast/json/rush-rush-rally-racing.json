  "description": "<i>Rush Rush Rally Racing</i> (or R4, for short) is an old school 2D top-down racing game. The game features no sponsored cars, no realistic environments, just action-packed arcade game play!<br><br>Originally intended as a small coding exercise, the project soon grew to such proportions that it compelled the creators to turn it into a complete game.<br><br>The title makes sense because the four R's represent the number of players that can simultaneously enjoy this game.",
