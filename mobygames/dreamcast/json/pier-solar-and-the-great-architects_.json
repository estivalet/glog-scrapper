  "description": "<i>Pier Solar and the Great Architects</i> is an enhanced remake of the 2010 Genesis game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/pier-solar-and-the-great-architects\">Pier Solar and the Great Architects</a> following a crowd funding campaign. It is a JRPG game with turn-based battles. Originally designed as a game to resemble the 16-bit era, this version was updated for modern platforms. The core game is identical, but all assets have been redone with HD graphics along with the music. The story has been expanded with new locations and challenges, there are more than ten new sidequests, four new mini-games and new battle features. The game has been translated into six languages. For the HD graphics there is a regular HD and an HD+ mode where the latter adds more smoothing.",
