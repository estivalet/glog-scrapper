  "description": "<em>4x4 Evo</em> is a racing game featuring real-life pickup trucks and SUV's.  Actual trucks from manufacturers such as Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Nissan, Toyota and more are included. <br><br>The actual racing game is based very heavily on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Terminal+Reality\">Terminal Reality</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Monster+Truck\">Monster Truck Madness</a> series of games, except with SUV's instead of monster trucks.<br><br>One significant feature of <em>4x4 Evo</em> is the online multi-player option.  The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races.<br><br>In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode.  The career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.",
