The story focuses on the 18-year old protagonist enjoying the summer time with his old crush who is bad in town during the summer, as well as several other heroines which are all potential romantic partners. Based on the player's choices, the story branches and character react differently which lead to one of the many paths. The story starts on August 1st, and progresses in day-by-day manner. While the game does not feature any unlockable extras, the basic visual novel gameplay is present such as moving through locations on the map, reading through dialogues with ability to toggle off the dialogue window in order to see the clear and unobstructed background graphics, voice-acting for the main heroines, and other gameplay elements.
