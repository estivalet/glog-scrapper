  "description": "<i>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein</i> is the successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/star-gladiator-episodei-final-crusade\">Star Gladiator</a> released for Playstation. Like its predecessor it was first released on Arcade before being ported to the Dreamcast.<br><br>The game features 22 anime-like characters in a 3-dimensional futuristic world, except for the backgrounds and the menus, which are plain 2D bitmaps without a lot of movement. The stages are unlimited in all directions, so it's not possible to fall off the edge. The speciality of this game are the so called &quot;plasma moves&quot;, visually very appealing special moves which fill the screen and can be executed when you have collected enough &quot;plasma power&quot;. Despite of the 22 characters there are only 11 different move layouts, as one layout is shared by two characters.",
