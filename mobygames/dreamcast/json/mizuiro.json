  "description": "<i>Mizuiro</i> (????) was originally released as an adult visual-novel, which yielded this console port for PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast two years later. The game follows the story of Kenji Katase (?? ??), a high-school student who lives with his adopted sister, Yuki (??). One day, Kenji's childhood friend, Hiyori Hayasaka (?? ??), re-appears in his life and his long-gone feelings of affection toward her started to awaken.<br><br>As is the case with many romance-driven visual novels, your choices will determine how the story branches, and your actions will drive the story toward the heroine of your interest. While this console game version removed the adult content, it added additional character and story content with new CG events. As you play through the games, you unlock CG gallery for heroines which is accessible via main menu, along with the music player.",
