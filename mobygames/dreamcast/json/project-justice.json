It once more thrusts you into the shoes of a team of students, trying to find out what is causing all the bizarre events.<br><br>Players pick a school to fight for and smash their way through the other schools, questioning them until you find out what is happening. The gameplay is very similar in style to the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rival-schools\">Rival Schools</a>, featuring bombastic special moves and team-up attacks, along with the same, highly caricatured students.",
