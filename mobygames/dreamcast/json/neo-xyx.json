  "description": "<i>Neo XYX</i> is a vertical shooter with a hardcore sci-fi theme greatly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Toaplan\">Toaplan</a> games of the 90s. It features an intricate scoring system based around collecting medals dropped by enemies after their defeat. As players collect medals, the score value of each subsequent medal continues to climb as long as the chain isn't dropped, leading to high-risk scoring opportunities.",
