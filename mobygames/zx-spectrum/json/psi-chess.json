  "description": "<i>Psi Chess</i> is a chess game with both a 2D top-down and an heightened 3D view; the latter featuring two different sets. It allows to play chess for players of different skill levels (occasional players to correspondence), including a &quot;balance&quot; level which automatically matches to the player's response times. All chess rules, including the fifty-move-rule and promoting, are present, as well as a blitz mode for timed moves, position change and a way to solve mates.",
