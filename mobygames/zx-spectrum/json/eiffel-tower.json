  "description": "<i>Eiffel Tower</i> is an educational game that teaches French vocabulary. The aim of the game is to construct the Eiffel which is done by entering the correct French words. For each word the English equivalent and the number of letters in the word are shown as clues. Each correct answer leads to a new stage being added to the tower. Each stage represents one day's work and 21 correct answers are required to finish the construction. The game contains twenty word lists (ten on each side of the tape) and it is possible to create new ones.",
