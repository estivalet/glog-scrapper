  "description": "<i>Close-In</i> is a light cycle game that can be played by two players sharing the same keyboard or by one player against an AI opponent. The game is played on a single screen where each player can move around in nine directions, vertically, horizontally or diagonally. As they do lines are drawn behind them that act as obstacles that both players have to avoid crashing into. The aim of the game is simply to stay alive the longest by not crashing into either lines or the walls. This game has a hyperspace button which allow the player to be transported to a random location on the screen. There are five different mazes with different wall structures to play on. The speed and difficulty level can be set from zero to nine.",
