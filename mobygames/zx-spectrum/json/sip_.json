  "description": "S.I.P or Special Inter-Galactic Painter, is a Sci-Fi take and modern update of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/make-trax\">Make Trax</a>. The main goal is to change the colours of the platforms of each level by walking over them on either side. When all of the platform surfaces of that area have been changed, the level is complete. Each level has its own combination of platforms and dangers.<br><br>To survive, the player has to avoid walking onto certain areas of the platforms which are covered by spikes, or touching the creatures present on each level. Every time this happens a life is lost. Once all lives are lost, the game is over.<br><br>The player's feet are attached to the surface of the platform he is walking on, allowing him to walk on any side of the platform. The game only allows the player to jump between platforms when the platform surfaces are parallel.<br><br>S.I.P was later updated in a <a id=\"db364d99cfb1cfe9e015c288979f88692\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=ZX+Spectrum\">2014</a> version.",
