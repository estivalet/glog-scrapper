  "description": "<em>Night Gunner</em> is set in World War II, and loosely simulates the Lancaster plane, but despite this, and despite being from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Digital+Integration\">Digital Integration</a>, the game is more of a shoot 'em up than a flight simulator. <br><br>It's primarily split into shooting and bombing phases, the first of which is viewed from the cockpit, and sees the player shooting at balloons, planes (which are hostile) and big bombers. Damage can affect the engines, which affects the player's performance -  when 3 engines are destroyed, the plane crashes. Damage to the gun turret causes slower shooting, and eventually deprives the player of the ability to aim.<br><br>The bombing sections include high-level and low-level attacks, each with limited ammunition. High-level runs often involve intercepting shots before they can hit you, while on the low level runs there is a constant risk of hitting the ground, or being hit by enemy fire.",
