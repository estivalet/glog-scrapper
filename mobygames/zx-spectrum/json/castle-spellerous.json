  "description": "A villainous wizard has captured a princess and imprisoned her in his castle. The king is not too happy with this and send ten men in an attempt to rescue her. <i>Castle Spellerous</i> is an educational game that teaches children spelling. To rescue the princess the player has to spell a number of words right. Each word is shown on the screen briefly and the player has to memorize it and enter it correctly. By doing this the player constructs a tower piece by piece that ultimately will allow him to get into the castle. Answering wrong gives the wizard a chance to attack. He can then turn the player's men into either frogs, butterflies or bats or he can appear as a vampire bat and carry them away. The wizard can also do surprise attacks and then the player has to press the right key quickly to defend himself. The game is over when all the men have been lost. The player can choose between ten different vocabularies depending on difficulty and he can also alter these and add his own words. ",
