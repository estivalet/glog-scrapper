  "description": "<i>Adventures of Buratino</i> is a 2D arcade game with light adventure elements. It is loosely based on the characters and storyline from the book by same title by Alexei Tolstoi, a well-known Russian author, renowned mostly for his early science fiction and historical prose. The book is in fact based on Pinnochio's story, so Buratino is also made of wood and likes to skip his school classes.<br><br>The game is done in the style of the <i>Dizzy</i> series: the character goes back and forth across many screens, stumbling upon obstacles that are usually require a specific object to solve. First you need to pick up the item, and then select it from the list in the right place. There are other characters from the book that you can &quot;interact&quot; with, and they usually hold an item essential to the further advancement. But unlike <i>Dizzy</i>, there's no fighting or platform-related acrobatics in the game - the only &quot;action&quot; element is a sequence where Buratino needs to get away from the cops that are chasing him.",
