  "description": "After his adventures in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rupert-and-the-toymakers-party\">Rupert and the Toymaker's Party</a>, Rupert must now enter an Ice Castle belonging to Jack and Jenny Frost and rescue his four friends who are frozen in this platform game. Each friend is seen on one screen and you must navigate the platforms to reach him but there are various nasties trying to stop Rupert as well as ice which makes Rupert slide. If Rupert touches a nasty then he lose one of four Ice Pills and when touched with zero pills then it is game over. Once a friend is rescued then there is a little animated sequence showing Rupert taking the friend back to Nutswood Cottage.<br><br>Once all four friends have been rescued, Rupert then has to rescue them again but first items of clothing must be collected. Each friend is now two screens with the first screen collecting clothing and the second the rescue of the friend when all the clothing is collected. There are now more nasties to contend with including snowmen who throw snowballs but Rupert now has five Ice Pills. Once again when all four friends have been rescued then the game starts again but more and faster nasties.",
