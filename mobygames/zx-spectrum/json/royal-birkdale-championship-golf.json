  "description": "One of Britain's great golf courses is recreated in this early sports simulation. Like Ocean's other early licensed sports title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Daley+Decathlon\">Daley Thompson's Decathlon</a>, the game is split into two individually-loaded parts, with the front 9 on side 1 of the cassette and the back 9 on side 2.<br><br>Shot direction is selected by typing a compass direction value from 0 to 360, before choosing from the 10 clubs available, which include a sand iron and 2 drivers which can only be used on the tee or fairway. After this you can choose the relative percentage weight of the shot. A random wind effect can be switched on or off, affecting the game's difficulty. The release of the shot must be timed to set the level of draw and fade.<br><br>Once you reach the green you will have to consider the strength of the slope. Putting involves holding the P key to start the pace meter rising, then press it again to set the final pace of the shot.",
