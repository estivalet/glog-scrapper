In a whisper Winthorpe tells Arnold that the only thing that can save him is 'the Goblet Of Goodness' which can be found in the land of The Flower People'.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West.
