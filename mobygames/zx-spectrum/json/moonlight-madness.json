  "description": "Your scout duty takes you into the heavily booby-trapped home of an eccentric old professor, who suddenly collapses. His pills are locked in a safe at the other side of the building. It's your job to fetch them, and save the old man's life.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Set+Willy%27\">Jet Set Willy</a>, with each screen requiring a pre-planned path to cross it, and lots of doors to open. Falls will cost you a life, even if you land on something flat.",
