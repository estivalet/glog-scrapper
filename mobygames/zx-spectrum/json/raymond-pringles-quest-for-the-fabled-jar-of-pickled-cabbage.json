  "description": "<i>Raymond Pringle's Quest for the Fabled Jar of Pickled Cabbage</i> is a humorous text adventure.<br><br>The title of this game leaves nothing to the imagination. The player is Raymond. Raymond lives in a grotty little hole of a place and goes looking for the eponymous condiment. Along the way Raymond will need to use  one, some or all of the following; a halibut; a whistle; aftershave and a bazooka, though not necessarily all at once or in that order, all of which sums up the game and the humour that can be expected pretty well.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well X for EXAMINE. When completed correctly the player's final score should be 100%.\n",
