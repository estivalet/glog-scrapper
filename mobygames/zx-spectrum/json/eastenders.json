  "description": "In this game you play the role of a man who has to help out different people living in Albert Square in the fictional London borough of Walford from the B.B.C soap opera Eastenders. The gameplay involves you completing mini games within a time limit. Some games involve you helping with the laundry at the laundrette, ordering fruit and vegetables for the market and even trimming the flowers at the allotment.\nThe game features many different locations from the show including the Queen Victoria public house\nin which you have to make drinks but only using the correct classes as pouring  a glass of wine in a beer mug will lose you points.\n",
