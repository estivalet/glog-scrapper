The maze is viewed from the side and the player controls a character on top of it. Beneath the maze are nine boxes and the player has to guide a barrel into each box. The maze consists of tunnels and a number of gates, each which alters the direction of the barrels. The player has to study the maze to find the right route through the maze and then drop the barrels in right entry hole at the top. The player can also change the maze layout by moving it up and down. There's also an earthquake option which rattles all the gates at random. The game goes on until all 20 barrels have been used or all boxes are occupied.
