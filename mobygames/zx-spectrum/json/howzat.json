  "description": "<i>Howzat!</i> is a cricket management game for two players, licensed by controversial former Somerset captain <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,618191/\">Brian Rose</a> on its initial release. Both one-day and multiple-day test matches can be played, with the 17 county teams and 7 international test-playing nations of the time, plus the option to create your own. Each has a squad of 15 players from which to select your 11 starters, including a captain and a wicket keeper - each has a rating out of 10 for both batting and bowling, which can all be edited. After each ball is bowled the batting team decides whether to risk attempting to take a run. Boundaries, Extras, and over limits in One Day Matches are all also factored in. Full scorecards are displayed, and can be printed out.",
