  "description": "<i>Digger Dan</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/space-panic\">Space Panic</a> variant.<br><br>As in the original, the goal in each level (consisting of platforms and ladders) is to dispose of all the monsters. To do so, Digger Dan must dig holes for the monsters to fall into, then fill up the hole to kill the monster. Four different kind of monsters with increasing intelligence exist; killing the more devious ones earns more points. A new type of monster is added every two levels.",
