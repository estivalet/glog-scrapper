  "description": "The cover-mounted cassette with issue 67 of Your Sinclair magazine contained an exclusive game, and one which had never previous been released outside of a compilation. The former is <i>Brainsport</i>, a puzzle game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/soko-ban\">Soko Ban</a>. The screen displays a maze with corridors of varying lengths, some bricks, and the same number of designated spaces to park bricks in. Bricks can be pushed by the player's character, who follows the same maze restrictions as the bricks, but only a single brick can be pushed in any direction. This, coupled with the narrow corridors, can cause the player to get stuck. Points are not awarded until a level is completed; these are made up of points for the level difficulty, points for each block, and a bonus if the level is completed quickly enough. Each level also has passwords.<br><br>The second game which had not previously been on wide release is <i>Double Agent</i>, an unusual interactive fiction title. Only two members of a team send to the planet Marego survived an enemy attack, and they only exist as shells of themselves who can be guided by your instructions. Therefore, when guiding them on a mission to collect the energy-giving substances you need from this doomed planet, you can swap between the two players. This happens automatically ever time one of them moves, but can also be triggered by the player.<br><br>There are also two former commercial games - <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Activision\">Activision</a>'s terrorist-fighting adventure <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hijack\">Hijack</a> and <moby company=\"Hewson\">Hewson<moby>'s early 3D shooter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ad-astra\">Ad Astra</a>. Additionally there are demo versions of retro-style shooter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mega-phoenix\">Megaphoenix</a> and strategy game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Cromwell+at+War\">Cromwell at War</a>, and POKE cheats for several games.",
