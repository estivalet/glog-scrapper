  "description": "All the worlds power in the 21st Century is now nuclear energy and all the problems associated with producing it have been solved. The only problem now is the disposal of the waste that is produced and this is where you come in as you play the role of <i>Nuke Lear</i> (geddit?), manager of Radioactive Waste Depository over various levels. The game is a single screen platform game with the screen made up of four levels of platforms and they are connected by poles on either side of the screen. You start on the bottom of the screen while the barrels of waste appear from the top right and they move along paths coloured green and blue. <br><br>The barrels follow the green paths at first and move towards the bottom of the screen and you have to move around the screen and deflect each barrel with your body onto a blue path. The barrels have been disposed of when they reach the end of the blue paths and you get a salary with the amount of pay depending on the level. If they reach the bottom of the screen then they have to be removed and you lose part of your salary with a reduction of 5%. If five barrels sit in one place on the bottom of the screen then the plant explodes and you lose 20% of your salary. Once you reach a score of  80% you get promoted and move to the next level where telephones start ringing and must be answered as your salary is suspended.",
