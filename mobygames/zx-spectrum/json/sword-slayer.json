  "description": "You are Spartacus and you are a Gladiator planning to rebel against the Roman Empire by escaping from slavery and releasing all the other slaves from the Roman Crassus. <i>Sword Slayer</i> is a fighting game where the game is viewed from the side and you must fight various opponents one at a time with your sword and shield as well as face an Eagle that swoops in. Once you have escaped the Arena you must defend against arrows flying towards you at different heights from the right of the screen. You and your opponent have three parts of energy. As you hit and block your opponent you attempt to get a clean hit and if a hit connects then the person hit loses a part of their energy. Lose all three and it's game over. The game also allows another player to play and that person plays as your opponents.",
