  "description": "The world cup of Opera gathers the confrontations of the twenty-four teams which participated in Italy '90, besides offering options of pre-world cup, training and demo mode. If we chose the last one, we will see the computer playing all the matches in the same order the FIFA fixed them. The programmers have also distributed the abilities of every team according to the world ranking position they were occupying in that moment.<br><br>During the training, our team will practice on the turf all the time we could need. Once done, we will enter in the world cup mode, in which we can load/save game or start the competition. Chosen the teams, we will play (or see) the matches according to the developing of the world cup. Ampler is the fan of possibilities in the pre-world cup mode, since we will play with those teams we would have selected, being them controlled by another player or the computer.",
