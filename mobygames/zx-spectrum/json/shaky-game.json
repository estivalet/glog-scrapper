  "description": "Shakin' Stevens, whose nickname was Shaky, was a popular music artist known as the Welsh Elvis.  His rockabilly songs became well-known in the 80's and he had more UK Top-40 hit records in that decade than any other artist (33 in his career).  This game was included on the music cassette of &quot;The Bop Won't Stop&quot; album and is compatible with the 48k Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer. He introduces the game on the album before the program audio by explaining the concept of the game to his fans.<br><br>The game design is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/head-on\">Head-On</a> in that the screen shows a rectangular set of concentric tracks and you control a car as it moves independently around. You only are able to move the car left or right at 4 points on the screen to an inner or outer track from its current one. You must avoid bats that move in the opposite direction around the tracks and eventually try to get to the center as fast as possible where Shaky's ole house is located (his first #1 record was This Ole House). There are 5 difficulty levels which speed up the movement.  Attempt to make it on the list of best scores.",
