  "description": "<i>Nicotine Nightmare</i> is a game in which the protagonist has the main task to stop a tobacco industry from producing cigarettes. The game starts with a screen very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pssst\">Pssst</a> in which the hero has to extinguish some cigarettes with a watering can paying attention to a devil who from time to time re-ignites them. The following stages look like a more straightforward platformer in which the goal is to halt the cigarette production by simply turning off the machinery.",
