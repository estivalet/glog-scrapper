  "description": "Jackpot is a fruit machine game that simulates the game-play of a fruit machine of the 1980's.\nIt is fully featured for machines of that era with such features as hold, nudges, gamble nudges, gamble winnings and a feature box.\nThe nudge and hold features of the simulation are explained in four detailed animated help screens at the start of the game.<br><br>You start with an initial stake of 200 and each go costs 10p. Winnings, should there be any, can be collected or gambled.\nThe game has fruit symbols, in colour and sound effects.  Five symbols are shown per reel which is a great help when using the nudge feature (which allows nudges up as well as down). There is a 'nudge feature box and the number of nudges awarded, up to sixteen, depends upon which symbols in this box are lit.<br><br>Once the game has loaded you press one button to put a coin into the machine, only one coin can be loaded at a time, and the simulation will tell you if you the hold feature is available. Once this has been dealt with another key is used to start the simulation. The reels spin and when they stop you may, or more likely, may not have won. Occasionally nudges are available and action keys are used to nudge the reels up or down to try and get a winning line. That's all there is to the game. Repeat the above until all the money has gone.<br><br>There is no auto nudge, there is no 'cash climb' feature, nothing else because back when this simulation was developed such features were rare.<br><br>",
