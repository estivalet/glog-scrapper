  "description": "In <i>Tyrant of Athens</i> the player becomes the ruler of a Greek city-state. The game starts in Athens, Vth century BCE, surrounded by rival Greek cities and the hostile Persian Empire. The gameplay is similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=The+Sumer+Game+variants\">Hammurabi</a> - each year the player must make decisions vital to the survival of the polis: choosing the number of troops to train, warships and merchant ships to built, units of food to export/import (to sustain the population), to how many allies grant the citizenship (yet they may desert or even rebel) - all of the above makes expenses from the treasury. You'll also respond to attacking armies/fleets (whether to fight back or pay them a tribute). The game plays up to 30 turns, but may end earlier if you suffer disasters and defeats.",
