  "description": "Grand Dizzy needs help testing his toy making machine and you Dizzy have agreed to help. Your job is to move a bar at the bottom of the screen with the outline of a cross or oval and make sure this matches the shape falling down the screen from one of four tubes. The tubes move slowly down the screen but can be paused for a short moment when the correct shape is matched. If the incorrect shape is matched then the tubes moves closer towards the bottom. When the tubes reach the bottom then it's game over.<br><br><i>Dizzy Panic</i> is a puzzle game viewed from the side showing the factory. Dizzy is seen in the middle of the screen. The joystick moves the shape bar left and right and holding down the fire button speeds up the shapes till the button is released. As well as the main playing area you can see your level, score and shapes collected.",
