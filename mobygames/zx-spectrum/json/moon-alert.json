  "description": "The Moon Buggy style of games are viewed from the side, and involve trying to guide a Buggy across the jagged surface of the moon, shooting out rocks and occasional aliens in the process. In most games of the type, the moon setting affects the surface but not the atmosphere, yet in this implementation Ocean have attempted to add a feeling of gravity in the way the buggy moves.<br><br>The game features over 300 screens worth of gameplay, split into 26 sections which are identified by the letters of the alphabet. These markers also act as restart points for when you lose one of your 3 lives. The aliens drop bombs at you, which must be dodged.",
