  "description": "<i>Bog Of Brit</i> is a humorous text adventure.<br><br>Bog is a barbarian, one of a race of fierce warriors for whom pillaging a village or two is something to while away the time between wars, it is safe to say that barbarians were hated and despised throughout the civilised world. Bog was a different kind of barbarian. Bog was kind, gentle and good which meant that he had a terrible life - barbarian children would often set the warhounds on him for fun just to see how fast he could run. One day he'd had enough so he left the village and set off, warhounds at his heels, on a quest with four goals<li>to avoid being ripped to shreds\n</li><li>\n to a acquire a vast fortune\n</li><li>\nto find your lost family heirloom, the bloodthirsty Blade of the Bogs and\n</li><li> to slaughter hundreds of misunderstood animals and/or sorcerers</li><br>\nThis game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as some more unusual commands such as MOUNT/DISMOUNT which allow Bog to ride a horse",
