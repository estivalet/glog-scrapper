  "description": "<i>Rotten Egg Mines</i> is a <i>Minesweeper</i> variant and was inspired by it. The main goal is to discover all the hidden mines in a scenario by logical deduction. The platform where the mines are hidden is the representation of the ZX Spectrum keyboard with its keys literally corresponding to the user's keyboard. Each key potentially hides a mine. When successfully clicking on a safe key, it will show the number of existent mines adjacent to it. The game is complete when all the safe keys are discovered and therefore clicked.",
