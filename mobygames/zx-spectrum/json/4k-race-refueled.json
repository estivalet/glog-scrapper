  "description": "<i>4k Race Refueled</i> is an enhanced remake of the 2004 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4k-race\">4k Race</a>, with a changed perspective and larger sprites. As before, it is a left-to-right 2D vanishing perspective racing game whereby you must avoid contact with computer opponents and the edge of the track whilst reaching 7 checkpoints before the timer runs down. Additional time is given once a checkpoint is passed. <br><br>Again, although it is just 4Kb in size, it will only run properly on 128k machines. It was entered into the 2005 FFD2 Minigame competition.",
