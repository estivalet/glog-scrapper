  "description": "<i>The Neverending Story II</i> is a platform game which is largely based on the movie. The concept is simple: you're Bastian, and are called forth once again by the Childlike Empress to save Fantasia, the Land of Dreams.<br><br>The game itself is indeed a platformer where you have to outrun giants (as in the movie) or push them over ledges. With every level you will be awarded with another advancement in the plot, usually a few pages written on a &quot;book&quot;.",
