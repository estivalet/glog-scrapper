  "description": "Penalty Soccer is a football game with easy rules: save 10 penalties before the striker scores 10. For every victory you qualify to the next level. For each level the game goes faster and your goalkeeper moves slower. Totally there is ten levels. Before the game starts you can choose who to take the penalty and this represents the difficulty level. In total there are eight levels with Keegan being the easiest and Maradona the most difficult.",
