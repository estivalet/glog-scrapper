  "description": "<i>Brain Damage</i> is a tank game that is similar to the Battle Tanks game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/tron\">Tron</a> arcade game. Like in Tron the game takes place inside a computer and the player's proton panzer has to be navigated through different mazes where it will come across three different kinds of enemies: electron panzers, marauders, centurians and rogue programs, each progressively smarter. Each maze is one screen in size and to finish it the player has to kill one or several enemy tanks. The tank's turret is controlled individually from the movement and projectiles can ricochet off walls and thereby hit an enemy around a corner.  At the easiest difficulty one hit is enough to destroy the tanks but the same is true for the player's. On harder difficulties more hits are required to take out an enemy. ",
