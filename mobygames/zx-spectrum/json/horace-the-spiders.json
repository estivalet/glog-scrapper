  "name": "Horace &amp; The Spiders",
  "shortName": "horace-the-spiders",
  "description": "A short platformer with three stages.  First Horace must jump over spiders while running forward.  The next stage is reached by jumping up to a hill.  Second stage involves Horace trying to cross over a ravine using the threads weaved by the spiders above.  Horace must time his jumps from thread to thread and avoid being reeled in by the nasty spiders.  In the last stage Horace must stomp out holes in the spider-web so that the arachnids will come and try to repair it.  That is when they are vulnerable and Horace can try to kill them by stomping them to death.",
