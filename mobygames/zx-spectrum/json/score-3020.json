  "description": "This game consists in disputing an exciting pinball game against a computer. But not a normal one, since its resources are unlimited and arranges of a huge army of mechanical exterminators ready to finish with us. The game objective is to lead a radioactive ball through 20 different boards full of dangers each one. On the left part of the screen we will find an indicator of radioactive energy that will be very important throughout the game, because, while the indicator is over half, we will be able to destroy the movable enemies when hitting against them, but if it is below this limit will not only not destroy the enemies, but in addition the firings of these will repel the trajectory of our ball. All the elements of the game have a specific utility and its knowledge is fundamental for trying to complete the route that will lead us to the last board.",
