  "description": "In this game you will have the possibility to play seven different championships, including the four Grand Slams, so, depending on the competition, you will play on clay, grass or synthetic surface while facing someone of the 11 best ATP players. You also will have the option to train with another player, the computer or using the ball-launcher machine. With the serve training and choosing equipment and surface, you will also improve your game on all the possible conditions. <br><br>If this game is called a simulator it's because: your shots will be different depending on the net distance, the effect and direction of the ball in serve will be defined by you, besides, you will have a total control of the ball direction, shot power and shot style on the moment of the impact (according to the pressed keys), you will be able to access to game stats on every moment, and finally, you will have the possibility of choosing racket and slippers (all of them adapted for every situation).",
