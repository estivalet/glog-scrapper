  "description": "<i>Gasienica</i> (Caterpillar) is an action game based on the &quot;Snake&quot; concept. The player controls a multi-segmented caterpillar, moving it around a playing field with food and rocks strewn about. Colliding with a rock, the level boundaries, or oneself makes the caterpillar lose a life; consuming a piece of food gives score and lengthens the caterpillar. Eating all the food allows the caterpillar to go to the next level. ",
