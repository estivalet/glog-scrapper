  "description": "The Starbike is sent out into space to rescue lost yellow aliens on a succession of levels. These must be picked up in turn and taken to the depository in order to ensure their safety. A scanner exists elsewhere to direct you to the next alien to save. The scanner will tell you when there are no more aliens; at this point you must return to the lander at which you start the level (it's near the depository) to move on. Leaving a level without saving all the aliens sees you get a scoring penalty.<br><br>There are plenty of other things out to stop you, from hostile aliens to space debris. Your Starbike has automatic fire, and is steered left or right, with thrust applied using the fire button to take you up the screen - releasing sees you drop back down gradually. You have one life, but can take four hits to the shield before a fifth is fatal.",
