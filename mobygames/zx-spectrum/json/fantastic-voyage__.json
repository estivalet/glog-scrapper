  "description": "Based on the classic 1966 science-fiction movie of the same name, this has you playing a miniaturized scientist that is injected into a human body in order to prevent the patient from dying.  You must shoot various bacteria, cholesterol blockages and viruses before the patient's temperature becomes critical. You must also collect 8 pieces of your shattered submarine which acts as a surgical scalpel when reassembled. Your own energy must be monitored as you travel through the body and can be replenished by finding red blood cells. ",
