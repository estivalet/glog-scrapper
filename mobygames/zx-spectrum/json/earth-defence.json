  "description": "<i>Earth Defence</i> takes its cue from the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/missile-command_\">Missile Command</a>.  In this single screen shooter you are the commander of three planetary defence missile batteries and your mission is to protect six cities. <br><br>You move a cross-hair around the screen and fire a limited supply of missiles from each battery. The missiles should be aimed to explode in front of the approaching nuclear missiles that come from the top of the screen to destroy them. If a nuclear missile hits a city then it is destroyed and once all cities are destroyed, then it is game over. Once a wave is over, bonus points are awarded for any cities and ammunition left. Then a new level starts with a fresh supply off ammunition where you protect the remaining cities from another attack with increasing difficulty. There are three levels in all.",
