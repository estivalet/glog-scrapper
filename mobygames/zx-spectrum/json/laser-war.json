  "description": "<i>Laser War</i> is a simple arcade game inspired by the movie <i>Tron</i>. Basically, it is a &quot;light-cycles&quot; competition, where the player competes against the computer or another human opponent. Two players move on the screen simultaneously, and leave behind a deadly trail. Each player must be careful not to hit into it, nor into any other obstacle - a collision results in a point for the opponent. Before the competition, the player can create their own set of obstacles and make a unique track.",
