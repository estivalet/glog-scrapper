While doing so he topples four jars containing the four talismans of the demon Trodor, setting him free to wreak havoc in the castle. The talismans must be restored to contain the evil demon and restore peace.<br>\nMerlin Jr. travels around the castle in search for items that aid in his quest; he needs spells to deal with the various enemies set free by the demon and keys to access different types of doors. Four pieces of each talisman need to be found and brought to temples in the heart of the castle in order to restore them.\n ",
