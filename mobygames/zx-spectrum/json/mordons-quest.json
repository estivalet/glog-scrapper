  "description": "You have a reputation as a worthy and capable adventurer. One day you encounter an old man named Mordon, who explains that he is one of the Ancient Ones, who have been guiding universes in a positive way for centuries. However, they have been dying out through old age, and so have built a time machine. <br><br>A younger Ancient One named Bostafer scuppered this, destroying the machine in the hope of using it to make himself immortal. Can you retrieve all the pieces from time and space before Bostafer? The pieces have attained mythical status in some cultures, so retrieving them may not be an easy task.<br><br><i>Mordon's Quest</i> is a pure-text Interactive Fiction game containing 150 locations and understanding over 400 words. Items you will find early in the game include a blowpipe, a black pearl and a crystal orb. Commands include CLIMB, SACRIFICE and INSERT, as well as standard movement and object-retrieval methods.",
