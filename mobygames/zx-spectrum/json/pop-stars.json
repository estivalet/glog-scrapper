  "description": "<i>Pop Stars</i> is a single player free-ware <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Sliding+block+%2f+tile+puzzle+games\">Sliding block / tile puzzle</a> game written for the Sinclair User magazine.<br><br>The story behind the game is that a military dictator of a middle eastern country has kidnapped six pop stars. The player takes the role of a secret agent who must free the prisoners by hacking into the dictators computer. Computer security is tight, it is protected by six fiendish sliding block puzzles.<br><br>The game first gives a brief description of a pop star who was around in the early 1990's. It then displays a picture which is then broken into small squares and jumbled up. It is the player's task to re-assemble the picture before the timer counts down to zero.\nLevel 1 shows Kylie Minogue and while reassembling her picture the game plays a version of one of her early hits 'Locomotion'.",
