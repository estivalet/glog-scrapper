  "description": "Exorcism should be good driving out evil. Or so the old benign Wizard was taught as a sprog. But he had just been exorcised by the forces of evil. Cast out from his village, stripped of his powers and spells and transformed into a hideously ugly parody of a human, he wandered the wastelands.<br><br>Slowly his powers began to return. He must return to his protectorate and recover his spells and reap his revenge on the evil that ruled where was once Kind Lord and Master. On the outskirts a page of his great book of spells blew into his weak grasp. &quot;Hakumba&quot;. He cried and in a twinkling lifted into the air. Soon his powers might be restored and his wards rescued from the forces of the night...<br><br>Create spells by combining items you find in the environment and use them to locate and destroy the Skull of Doom.<br><br>",
