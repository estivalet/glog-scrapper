  "description": "As a worker at a toy store, you must stop the toy robots from taking over the store, before they take over you. Stop the valves that are getting these toys released in order to control where they land on the floor. Make sure you are ready for those safety checks, turn off the valves before you are hit by hefty Hilda. Stop the toys by jumping over them, or by stunning them. Once you finish doing this, next hour, things start up again.",
