  "description": "<i>Knights &amp; Demons DX</i> is a remake of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/knights-demons\">Knights & Demons</a>, which is based on the puzzle game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lights+Out\">Lights Out</a>. This version has been rewritten using the BiFrost* engine which allows the Spectrum to display multicolored sprites without colour clash. Therefore it has all new graphics including pictures for intro, endings and game backgrounds as well as animated tiles. It also adds new music with four new tracks. The gameplay largely stays the same but a new feature is the addition of challenges which when completed give the player additional pikes.",
