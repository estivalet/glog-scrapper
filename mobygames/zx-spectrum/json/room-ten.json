  "description": "On the low-gravity worlds of the Galcorp, there is not much to do, so the corporation invents a new sport, played in low-gravity rooms. In essence it's a 3D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pong\">Pong</a> game, with the aim being to hit a ball towards the other player in such a way that he will be unable to return it. When the ball hits the back wall their opponent scores 5 points, with the first player to reach 35 being declared the winner.<br><br>The screen is split into two, showing the view of each player, with the bat in the middle to start with. The game speed can be altered from adagio (slow) to vivace (fast), and the skill of the computer player can be altered, as can the screen colour. A 2-player option is included.",
