  "description": "<i>Moggy</i> is an arcade game of careful navigation. The player controls the character Moggy who has to free his classmates who are under the spell of the evil sorcerer Hibön. The wizard lured them away during a party and wants to use their bodies to expand his power. Moggy is the only one who is not under the influence. The game consists of 25 levels or fields filled with trapped classmates who have a pink colour.<br><br>Moggy is presented as a yellow smiley. He can be freely moved around the single-screen field, but because he is still a little drunk from the party the controls are not entirely responsive. To free his classmates he simply has to move over them. This causes them to disappear and the HUD displays how many are left to be freed. Meanwhile he has to avoid poisonous bushes in fluorescent green and in later levels also Hibön's minions who roam the field. Moggy has no means to attack and can only move carefully. Each level has a time limit and if not all friends are freed before time is up, the level is lost. He starts with 20 lives and additional ones are provided for freeing a certain number of friends.",
