  "description": "<i>Vectron</i> is  first person 3D shooter inspired by the 'Space Paranoids' game from the 1982 movie Tron.<br><br>You move around a vector drawn 3D maze at a constant speed, unable to stop while encountering enemy hovering Randomiser robots and tanks. You have a movable crosshair akin to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/star-wars\">Star Wars</a> shooting at the enemies and a map can be called up to show the layout of the matrix. The objective is to clear the level of enemies and then find a portal in the center of the maze where the ROM Robot resides. Once defeated by shooting his eyes out you are transported to a random location in the maze and have to escape through a warp in the bottom right of the maze without the use of the map, since the ships computer has been 'destroyed' by now. An power bar determines your energy, reduced by hitting walls or taking enemy fire. Enegery canisters can be picked up to replenish energy. Once the energy reserves are up, it's game over.",
