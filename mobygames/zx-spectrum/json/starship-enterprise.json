  "description": "The Romulan Empire has attacked the Federation and virtually obliterated it. Only your ship remains operational, which leaves you on a solo mission to locate and wipe out the aggressive Romulan presence.<br><br><i>Starship Enterprise</i> places you in the captain's chair of the most famous starship in the Federation universe. A strategy exploration combat game, the gameplay isn't a fast shoot-em-up against numerous alien ships, but more strategical with the player accessing various shipboard controls (navigation computer, scanners, weapons controls, damage reports, etc.) as individual screens in game. The player's goal is to hunt out all the Romulan warships and destroying them.<br><br>The game's universe seemed vast (64 quadrants of space, each with 64 sectors to explore in each), and a randomly generated universe at each game start-up, and varying levels of difficulty, means that the game contains quite a lot of replayability.",
