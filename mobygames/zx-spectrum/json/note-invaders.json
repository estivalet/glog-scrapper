  "description": "<i>Note Invaders</i> is an educational game that teaches music notation. The program has three parts: an introduction, a test and an arcade game. In the arcade game the aim is to shoot down notes that travel across the stave from left to right. It is done by pressing the letter that corresponds with the note. If the wrong letter is pressed or if the note reaches the end bar line a bomb is dropped and the player loses one out of four bases. As the game progresses the speed increases and after a while the end bar will start moving inwards, giving less time for response. ",
