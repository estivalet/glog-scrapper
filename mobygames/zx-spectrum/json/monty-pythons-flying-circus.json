  "description": "<em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em> is an arcade style game based on the UK television series of the same name. Players control one of the &quot;Mr. Gumbies&quot; and maneuver him through multiple screens, throwing fish at flying feet and similarly surreal enemies. Periodically the game cuts away to a non-sequitur aside, such as a lesson on &quot;the larch,&quot; or a quick game of breakout.",
