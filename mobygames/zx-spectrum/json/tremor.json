  "description": "<i>Tremor</i> is an arcade action maze game. You control a Miracloid droid around a 400-room map, avoiding 20 types of enemy whilst collecting 10 jewel-shaped &quot;qigit&quot; objects. Each &quot;qigit&quot; must be dropped onto an associated dock, somewhere else on the map. Controls are left/right/thrust/jump/fire (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=JetPac\">JetPac</a>). There are power-ups etc. in some rooms. <br><br>Gameplay is mainly about exploration, with some quick reactions called for when enemies spawn in tricky situations. You can only hold 3 objects at any one time, so a certain amount of swapping and dropping objects is required. The game intro featured some 1-bit sampled speech.",
