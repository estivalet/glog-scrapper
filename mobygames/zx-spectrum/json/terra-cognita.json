  "description": "Mining Engineers working on the planet Krion have inadvertently triggered its destruction, and must escape in this vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up. There are over 100 screens to fly through, and they include many barriers and narrow paths, as well as force fields. There are also time-shift fields - some move you forward, but some send you back to the start.<br><br>Enemies are in short supply - the game's feel resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/artificial-dreams\">Artificial Dreams</a> (from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,154610/\">the same designer</a>). You have limited fuel and must collect fuel tokens to recharge this. Other available powerups include points bonuses, extra lives, changes to the constant speed of scrolling, and invincibility from force fields (although not enemies).",
