  "description": "<i>World Cup Soccer</i> was a package based on the FIFA World Cup. The package included a booklet and two programs. <br><br>The first program allowed you to see facts about the World Cup or participate with yourself or a friend in a quiz. The Facts section allowed you to see every result from every World Cup or how every team did as well. The Quiz section gave you 3 minutes to answer as many questions as you could from a choice of 5 answers. The quicker you answered a question the more points you received and if you played with a friend you took in it turns to answer a question. There was a high score table for the best scores.<br><br>The second program was a management game. Here you could choose any team that has played in the World Cup and attempt to get them to the final and win it. You are given a squad of players or you can select your own. Choose your best team and it's onto the actual match. The 1st half lets you watch the match highlights in text form with any major incidents appearing on the screen. Occasionally a penalty is awarded and you can choose which direction to kick it or which direction your keeper should dive. An isometric view of the penalty is shown to see if it was missed or scored. In the 2nd half you play two arcade sections to improve your score within a time limit. The two games are heading or shooting. The heading section is an isometric view and the ball comes in from the side. You have to position your player to head the ball at the goal. The shooting section is shown from above and shows a football boot. A ball bounces around the screen and you must move the boot to hit the ball into a moving net at the top of the screen. You must make sure the ball doesn't go past your boot into the net behind you. The computer decides how well you played and adds goals to your score or the oppositions.",
