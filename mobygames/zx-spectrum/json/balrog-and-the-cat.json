  "description": "<i>The Balrog And The Cat</i> is a humorous text adventure featuring a Balrog. Balrogs are a sort of goblin and this one appears in many of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Zenobi+Software\">Zenobi Software</a>'s games, and also seems to have run their website.<br><br>This game sees the player take the role of Balrog, who's at home enjoying a green cheese sandwich, brown bread of course, when there's a scratching at his door. The source of the annoyance turns out to be a smoking cat, it's the pet of a magician 'The White Wassock' who happens to be short sighted - that's how the cat was accidentally teleported to Balrog's door with it's tail on fire. The object of the game is to help the cat. <br>Along the way the player will encounter at least one troll, characters from other Zenobi games, and frequent pubs. When the game is successfully completed the player will have scored 135/135 points\n",
