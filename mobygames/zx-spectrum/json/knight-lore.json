  "description": "Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Ultimate+-+Play+the+Game\">Ultimate</a> titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. <br><br>The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/head-over-heels\">Head Over Heels</a>, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.",
