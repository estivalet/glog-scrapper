  "description": "There are a group of scientists in East Germany who want to defect to the West. Problem is the authorities want them to stay to help develop a new weapon. You must fly over five missions to help get these scientists into the West. In the first four missions you must collect six scientists on each mission and take them to a safe house. On the fifth mission you must take these scientists over the border to West Germany. <br><br>The scientists will stand in the open waving their left hand. Beware of soldiers disguised as scientists. You can tell these because they wave with their right hand. Off course your not just going to fly in without resistance. Soldiers, jeeps and tanks on the ground with soldiers wearing jetpacks in the air all try to halt your mission. <br><br><i>KGB Superspy</i> is a side scrolling shoot-em-up. The screen scrolls both left and right. You control your helicopter with the joystick while the fire button shoots your cannon. To pick up a scientist you must lad on him. To release him you must land on the safehouse (a grass roofed hut). You only have a certain amount of fuel but jerrycans can be collected or land on a safehouse to refuel. On the screen are two arrows pointing left and right. These flash to tell you the direction of the nearest scientist. Also seen is your energy bar, score, lives and how many scientists collected.",
