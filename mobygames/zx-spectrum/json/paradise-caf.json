  "description": "This is a porn Portuguese game, based upon a character whose primary goal in life is to earn money, by the lowest means. The player incarnates the role of a marginal and criminal. He can become a drug dealer, a rapist, a burglar or an addicted for sex. The player has the ability to do many transgressions while taking decisions on the situations he'll face during the game.<br><br>The resting place of the player is located at a local nightclub called Paradise Café where he can make illegal deals with the waiter by buying drugs and pistols, necessary &quot;tools&quot; for the good management of his precious and indispensable money. The player is perpetually walking next to &quot;Pandora&quot; doors, randomly potential surprises of situations that appear in front of him of which he can take advantage or suffer the consequences of his bad decisions. <br><br>There are policemen, robbers, old women, prostitutes, and to loose or earn money in that trail of surprises is a mixture of combination of luck and management. The game also proportionates a humorous experiences by its unexpected situations. <br><br>The graphics occupy 3 quarters of the game, resembling Popeye or The Trap Door. The gameplay is easy and combines several genre elements as adventure, adult, management, strategy and even RPG.<br><br>Paradise Café emerged in a Portuguese society where drug dealing, prostitution and poverty were taboo and they were the scourges of an afflicted generation born in poor social conditions and sociological turmoil.<br><br>Until this day it's not known who the programmers are, but it is reasonably to assume, almost for certain that every Portuguese related to video gaming has a Paradise Café copy.",
