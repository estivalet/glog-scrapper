  "description": "The <i>Tomb of Syrinx</i> is legendary among would-be explorers; nobody has ever escaped it. You aim to be the first, which will mean collecting its five keys. The Immune Guardians make life harder, but fortunately you are armed with a laser gun to stun (and in some cases kill) them. <br><br>There are snakes, mummies and other Egyptian-themed nasties to contend with as well, generated at random and following random movement paths and bouncing off the many walls and obstacles. They change colour depending on how many more shots they need to be killed, following the Spectrum's BASIC colour codes (blue need one shot, red needs two, magenta three).<br><br>The game uses block-scrolling, moving along as you reach the edge of the screen - although the level design ensures that you will not hit unforseen enemies this way.",
