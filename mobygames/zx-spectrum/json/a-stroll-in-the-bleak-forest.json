  "description": "<i>A Stroll In The Bleak Forest</i> is a single player, 3D maze solving game. This is the second outing for our hero Bart Bear. <br><br>In the first game Bart thought he'd destroyed 'Mega-Brain' but the villain had one trick up its sleeve - it mind-warped to the planet Verdunian 7.  Bart flies there to do battle because the beast has only one goal, the destruction of mankind!<br><br>The game is authored with 3D Game Maker. All screens are drawn in green and each screen shows a single cell. The player moves from one cell to another via gates in the walls, some cells have multiple  entrances/exits while others have only one. Most cells have bad things in them. <br><br>Bart will encounter drones - invulnerable flying saucer things that just move back and forth, attack drones - these will shoot Bart but can be destroyed by Bart, spiders - Bart is immune to their poison but they cluster around him pinning him in one corner, and more.",
