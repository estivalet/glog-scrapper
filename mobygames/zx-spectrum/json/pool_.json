  "description": "This is a very simple pool simulation for one or two players. <br><br>The playing screen consists of a red cue ball and 6 numbered red balls on a green background.\nIn the top left of the screen is a blue power bar that cycles through 1 to 5 levels. The player uses the arrow keys to position a cursor, then presses S to shoot.\nIf you don't pot anything after about half a dozen shots, then the game resets.\nThere's no clever physics behind this game, balls don't seem to slow down as they move across the table, they move at a steady pace until they stop.<br><br>The points scored for each ball potted are calculated as 10 * the ball's number<br><br>",
