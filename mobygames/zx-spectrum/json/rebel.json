  "description": "In the future, working conditions in agridustrial combine compounds are a step back to slavery, with no prospects, long hours and poor treatment. One day THX2240 (an obvious <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=George+Lucas\">George Lucas</a> reference) decides she's had enough, and steals a Crowd Control vehicle to escape.<br><br>Escaping from the whole 10-level complex is a big task though, as each of the many compounds has its own locks. These can be removed using mirrors to guide a solar beam onto the locks, weakening them. There are patrol guards trying to stop you, and each time you fire a beam and it fails to open a door, you lose a life. The action is viewed from above with a pseudo-3D feel.",
