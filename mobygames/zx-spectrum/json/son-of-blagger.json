  "description": "Players control Slippery Sid, who is an espionage agent and son of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/blagger\">Blagger</a>. Like the first game, the task is to collect a series of keys scattered around the level. Sid must navigate a series of platforms while jumping over robots that guard the keys. Once Sid collects all the keys, he can make his way to the next level by going through a doorway. Like his father, Sid has a limited time to perform this task, and he loses one of his lives if he fails to collect all of them, or if he falls long distances.\n",
