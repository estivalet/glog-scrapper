  "description": "The plot of <i>Intensity</i> deals with the space station Canis Major which was overrun by aliens. There is no chance to defeat them by force and therefore the station has to be evacuated. This noble task falls to the player who controls a skimmer. It is basically used to fly over the one-screen levels and mark the place the drone, a rescue ship, should land. There are various openings in each level and from time to time astronauts come out of those - of course the drone should be nearby then. <br><br>After collecting a certain amount of astronauts the exit opens, but the player may choose to spend more time collecting to earn additional money (but this also leads to a more difficult level afterwards). Between levels it can be used to buy additional drones and skimmers; both available in three variants: pricier ones can take more hits. Better skimmers additionally fly higher, meaning some obstacles don't have to be circumvented. The enemies are aliens which are walking over the levels. At first they are no threat, but they can mutate into one of two forms. Stalkers have the ability to transform astronauts into suicide bombers; trackers go directly after the skimmer. A crash between skimmer and drone is always deadly.",
