  "description": "After nuclear wars of the past, the planet Galletron has been isolated for many years, but it's now visible again, and still a beautiful place. If the Aarls take charge of it, the results for nearby planets could be catastrophic, so the Federation of Interplanetary Trustees (FIT) have send you in to ensure this doesn't happen.<br><br>First you must head to 9 nearby planets and destroy their sophisticated communications systems (the Aarls have technology to beam solid matter around the universe), before heading for Galletron itself. You have two distinct guns, one for destroying enemies and one for destroying locked security doors. Use of these drains the ship's energy, which can be replenished by picking up tokens. Control is by rotating the ship and then thrusting it forward or backwards.",
