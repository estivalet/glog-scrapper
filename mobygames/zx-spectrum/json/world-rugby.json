  "description": "Time to take your favourite country from the bottom of the pile to be the best team in the world. Time to manage them and make them men, winning promotion from division 3 to division 1. After choosing your country you are taken to a list of options. Here you can pick your team, train them and check any injured players. <br><br>The actual match is shown in a TV studio with a presenter. Here you see a clock counting the minutes gone in the game. When there is a decisive moment the game switches to a overhead view of the pitch. Here you can see an attempt at a try or a kick at goal. Sometimes a try is scored or the player is tackled. If a try is scored then you watch the conversion attempt.",
