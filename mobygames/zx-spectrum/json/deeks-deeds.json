  "description": "<i>Deek's Deeds</i> is a humorous text adventure. The player takes the role of Deek McDeek, who is a member of the secret Retrochrone organisation. Deek's mission is to return to the Middle Ages and dispose of 'Reg the Bad' because this will 'make Acton Trussell a safe place for hamsters and gerbils alike'. <br><br>The game is unusual as before Deek begins his adventure he must select five useful items to take with him. According to the Zenobi game description, if the player starts with the wrong objects then they cannot complete the game. <br><br>It was developed using <i>The Quill</i> authoring system and therefore supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West and L/I/G/X for Look/Inventory/Get/Examine. There is no RAMSAVE option.",
