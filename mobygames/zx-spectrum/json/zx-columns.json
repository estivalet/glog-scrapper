  "description": "<i>ZX Columns</i> is a remake inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> based game of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=columns\">Columns</a>, for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.<br><br>The gameplay is largely identical to the game on which it's based, and involves forming a group of 3 or more gems with the same colour in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line in order to remove them from the game grid.\nZX Columns also features a unique white gem which removes all the gems of the colour it comes into contact with.\nAs you remove gems from the grid you will gain points, the points will increase the gameplay level which in turn increases the speed that the gems come down.",
