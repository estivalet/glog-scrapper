  "description": "This is a 'Casino simulator' consisting of five games at which you can gamble your virtual money. The player starts with $10.000 and the object is to win as much money as possible at one of five gambling games. These games can be played in any order and, if the player's had enough of, say, poker then they can choose to stop and pay any other game. All the games are explained in the cassette inlay.<br><br><b>1 million dollar fruit machine</b> - \nThe easiest way to gamble, just press a key to spin the reels. Each spin costs $1,000.<br><br><b>Blackjack</b> - \nAlso known as 'Pontoon' and 'Vignt-et-un'. To win the face value of the players cards must exceed that of the dealers but must be lower than 21<br><br><b>Roulette</b> - \nUse action keys to determine how much is being bet, the odds for your bet, and then position your chips on the table. Up to 10 bets can be placed at a time.<br><br><b>Poker</b> - \nThe game is five card draw poker and the player plays against the dealer. The aim is to beat the dealer by either having a better hand or bluffing the dealer into quitting.\nAfter cards have been dealt both the player and the dealer can stay, bet or drop/fold. If both the player and the dealer remain in the game then cards can be exchanged and a second round takes place after which cards are shown and the hand is won/lost.<br><br><b>Craps</b> - \nThis is a dice game where bets are placed on the anticipated spot value of the next throw. The player chooses the stake to be wagered and then the type of bet to be made, 'big six', 'big eight', 'pass line bet' etc. <br><br>The game features authentic rules.<br><br>",
