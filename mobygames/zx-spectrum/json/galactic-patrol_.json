  "description": "You are the commander of a spacecraft and your mission is to seek and destroy as many Klingons as you can in the deepest reaches of space. They must be destroyed to stop them from destroying Starbases in the area. Your craft is armed with limited amounts of phasers and torpedoes as well as a shield to protect yourself from attack. To move about, your ship has eight warp speeds but constant use of warp eight can damage your ship. Your craft will also tell you the direction and distance to the nearest Starbase and you also have a scanner to tell you if any Klingons are nearby. Before the game you can choose the speed (1-9), difficulty (1-9) and the length of game (1-9).<br><br>The game is a 1st person shooter with the screen split into two, the top half is your view into space while the bottom half is your instrument panel. As you search you will encounter Kilingons and you must try to destroy them before they hit you and increase your damage. You are able to outrun them if you go into warp eight. Moving through space, arming your weapons and having your shields on drains your energy though. Emergency repairs can be carried out while travelling. Once you reach a Starbase you can refuel, re-arm and repair any damage but be careful that you didn't let any Klingons follow you as they will destroy the base.",
