  "description": "Two previously-unreleased games make up this compilation. Grid Run is an action game, played out on a simple maze with lanes of dots, which must be collected in the same way as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pacman\">Pacman</a>, by moving in and out of the lanes (the car moves automatically at a set speed). The computer drone cars must be avoided. The car is controlled with only 2 keys which move it to either the next lane out or the next lane in. A bonus car is awarded every 10,000 points. The player can also press a key to pause the game.<br><br>Pontoon recreates the classic card game, in which the player is dealt 2 cards and has the objective of getting as close to 21 without exceeding it. The computer plays aces logically, and results are fully assessed on screen.",
