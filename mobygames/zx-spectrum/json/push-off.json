  "description": "<i>Push-Over</i> belongs to the group of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Pengo+variants\">Pengo</a> variants with a quite similar gameplay.<br><br>The story tells that the player starts the game at <i>Bertha's</i> garden, the ladybird he will command during the game. It's been a hard time for her since her garden has been infested by menacing insects, but fortunately she has the player to account for.<br><br>His task is to get rid of all the bugs present on each scenario by crushing them with the push of heavy bricks, or by turning them into jelly when the alarm bells are rung. Beware that bells only ring for a short period of time and bricks can be pulverized by the insects suddenly destroying a shield the player might have at that time. He can generate new ones indefinitely, but each bell can only be used one time during the game.<br><br>There are 8 levels to complete with an increasing degree of difficulty. <br><br>",
