  "description": "<i>Super Brat</i> this Tennis game was originally released as Wimbledon Challenge and sold in the souvenir shop during wimbledon fortnight. It was then renamed in recognition of the American tennis star John McEnroe nicknamed &quot;Superbrat&quot;, referring to McEnroe's verbal and physical actions in anger when a line call went against him.<br><br>It is a relatively simple but playable game written in basic computer language with constraints of speed and limited colours. The player may enter the name and select a 3 or 5 set match. The goal is to win three tournaments: the British, the European and the World finals. The game follows the rules of the Lawn Tennis Association. The player uses only three keys - left and right for taking a position and P for tossing and hitting the ball however, the timing of your hit can control the direction to outwit the opponent SuperBrat.",
