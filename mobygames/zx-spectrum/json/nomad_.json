  "description": "Cyrus T. Gross has built the TALOS asteroid and directed it towards earth. Only the Nemesis Organisation's Mobile Attack Droid 471 can save humanity now. <br><br>In <i>N.O.M.A.D.</i>, players take control of the Mobile Attack Droid 471 as it ventures through the city, in this top-view shooter. Players begin with four lives. The Droid moves with considerable inertia (although some rooms disable this), and control involves using left and right to rotate it, pushing forward to provide thrust in the direction it is facing, and pushing backwards to reverse. <br><br>The early part of the route is linear, but later on there are junctions to plan around. Moving enemies, spawning points and wall-mounted guns are the main threats. There are many switches along the walls, which open the sealed doors located throughout the levels, although a switch doesn't automatically operate on the nearest door. The game features regular checkpoints, which will restore the droid to that point after the lose a life. Points are awarded constantly for survival, and for shooting the enemies and other targets.",
