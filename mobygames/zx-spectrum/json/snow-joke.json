  "description": "<i>Snow Joke!</i> is a text adventure game, though the 'adventure' is limited to just the one location.<br><br>This game shows that adventure games don't have to involve intercontinental treks, mighty deeds, heroics and evil scientists, with a bit of imagination anything can be presented as an adventure. Here the player sets off for work one morning in winter and gets stuck in their car. They are alone on a country road, the engine stops and won't restart, the door handle is frozen (gosh! I'd forgotten there was a time before in-cat heaters) and they are stuck.<br>The object is, unsurprisingly, to escape.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West, though in this game these are unlikely to be needed, as well X for Examine. <br><br>A  successful solution scores 50/50",
