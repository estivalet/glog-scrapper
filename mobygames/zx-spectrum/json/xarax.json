  "description": "Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xevious\">Xevious</a> the plot is basically &quot;bomb and blast the way to the salvation of your world&quot;, which is an excuse for you to control a ship and bomb gun placements and blast flying alien craft. The game is a vertically scrolling top down game and with a joystick or keyboard you control your ship over seven levels. One or two players can play and each take it in turn when the other player loses a life. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score and lives.",
