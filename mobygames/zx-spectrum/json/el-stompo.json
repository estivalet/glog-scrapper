  "description": "You are <b>El Stompo</b>, TV repair thing of some considerable repute. Your job is to fix all TVs on each level through brute force (by stomping on them). The game combines arcade and puzzle elements, requiring players to plan their routes and use different gameplay elements to avoid all kinds of enemies. Technically it's implemented using the NIRVANA Engine, which allows the ZX-Spectrum to display full-screen multicolor (combining more colours than normally possible without colour clash).",
