  "description": "As famous seducer of XVIII century, Giacomo Casanova, you are walking on the streets of some town full of obsessed women and jealous men. Using your mandolin you should clean your way of the town inhabitants shooting the music notes at them. The amount of notes are limited as well as the amount of life and the amount of your life energy, which may be reduced by items thrown at you by town inhabitants. Lovely doves may increase your energy feeding you with eggs, which they drop during flying. Also you may climb the static chains and the ropes emerging from the magic pots, jump, and collect the brassieres increasing your score. Every contact with town inhabitant will take one of your lives out and return you to the starting position of your perilous adventure.",
