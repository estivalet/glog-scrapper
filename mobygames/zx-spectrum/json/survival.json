  "description": "<i>Survival</i> aims to teach children about nature, by simulating the lives of six distinct creatures - lions, hawks, mice, robins, butterflies and flies. The player takes control of one, and must move it through the game's simulated world, ensuring it's survival. This involves keeping its energy and water levels high enough, finding food, and avoiding predators and poachers. The world includes ice caps, jungles, towns and freshwater, which affect different creatures in different scientifically-accurate ways.<br><br>Some animals have a longer-range view of the the world than others, which makes it easier to spot opportunities and threats. Turns last longer for animals with longer lifespans. As you move around, so do the other animals so there is an element of luck in getting food - don't let your creature get too hungry. ",
