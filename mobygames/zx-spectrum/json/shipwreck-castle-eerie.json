  "description": "A compilation of two original games, it includes the text adventures <i>Shipwreck</i> and <i>Castle Eerie</i> made using the Quill adventure generation software from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Gilsoft\">Gilsoft</a> with some graphics. You tell the game what you want to do via a textual interface and the parser is based on a verb / noun input.<br><br>In <i>Shipwreck</i> you find yourself on a passenger cruiser that is about to sink and must plan your own survival by preparing for the imminent demise of the ship. In the second half, having no inventory apart from the clothes you are wearing, you end up stranded on a seemingly deserted island. The objective is to find your way back to civilization.<br><br><i>Castle Eerie</i> casts special agent Charlie Jones as the protagonist of a mystery hunt where the task is to figure out what is going on in the titular eerie castle. A gang of criminals are using the castle for their nefarious purposes and once their sinister plans have been uncovered the agent must report his findings to the outside world.",
