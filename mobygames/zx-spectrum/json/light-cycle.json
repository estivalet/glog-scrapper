  "shortName": "light-cycle",
  "description": "This was an early interpretation of the Tron Light Cycles game style, in which the players (two on here, with the option of human or computer opposition) control a beam of light, which constantly extends as you move automatically. They must move it around an arena so as to cause their opponent's beam to crash into part of their's, or into the wall. This can be done by moving yours tightly around, so as to cram your opponent into a small space.<br><br>The control method of this version involves up, down, left and right controls, with instant death (and the resultant multi-colour display in the border) occurring from trying to double back on yourself, or hitting any part of your own beam. There are 7 speed level on offer.",
