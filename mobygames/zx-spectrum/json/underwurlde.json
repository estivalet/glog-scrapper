  "description": "Sabreman’s second game (following <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sabre+Wulf\">Sabre Wulf</a> and preceding <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/knight-lore\">Knight Lore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pentagram\">Pentagram</a>) finds him trapped in an underground cavern network, split into nearly 600 side-viewed screens. There are three ways to escape, each protected by a guardian who can be killed using one of the three major weapons you can locate – a dagger, a torch and a knife.<br><br>As you explore the levels, you will encounter randomly-moving nasties, who can’t kill you but can knock you off your path and cause you to fall. Eagles can grab and drop you in mid-air. Falls of much more than a screen’s height cost you a life, although extra ones are available. Jewels can be collected for temporary invincibility.<br><br>The game’s screens are functionally split into Castle and Caverns, with the castle screens higher up. Moving across the castles involves a lot of blind jumps, often deliberately bouncing off fortuitously-placed objects such as flower pots. In the caverns, use a rope to hook onto the ceilings and move up and down – if you have found it. How many screens deep you are is noted on screen at all times.",
