  "description": "&quot;Shockway Rider&quot; is an action game taking place in some distant future where every big city is surrounded by moving pedestrian walkways called shockways. The goal of the game is to complete a full circle on the shockway, which consists of three lanes moving at different speed. Obstacles are provided by gang members and angry citizens who block the shockways and have to be fought off with weapons or bare fists.",
