  "description": "<i>F.I.R.E.</i> (Fast, Ingenious and Risky Elimination) is a horizontal scrolling space/planet based shoot-em-up. Your space-ship starts the game moving slowly, and with a low rate of fire. Upgrades can be obtained to increase speed, rate of fire, adding a laser, or providing a shield which makes you invulnerable for a fixed period of time. The upgrades are earned by collecting circular tokens with a B on them, which can be destroyed by shooting them. The upgrade system is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a> like, so once the required number of tokens are collected, the particular upgrade can be selected.<br><br>The player starts with three lives, and each time a life is lost the power-ups are also lost. There are four levels in total, with a &quot;boss&quot; located at the end of each. After destroying the final boss, the levels repeat.",
