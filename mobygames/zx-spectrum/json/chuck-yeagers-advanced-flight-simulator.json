  "description": "In <i>Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer</i> you have the chance to test pilot 14 different airplanes, such as the Bell X-1 and the Lockheed SR-71. It features 10 different viewpoints both inside and outside of the plane, with a zoom of up to 256x, and different aerodynamics for each plane.<br><br>You can do different things with the planes, from racing against a computer opponent, to practising formation and stunt flights. You can follow the testing and development programme through its evolution.<br><br>There is a &quot;black box recorder&quot; to replay your flights, and analysis of your performance compared to an ideal one.",
