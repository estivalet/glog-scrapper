  "description": "The Tasty Space Griffin, a rare, bird-like creature, is considered a delicacy and has acquired great value. On the moon of a distant planet, mercenaries have been secretly breeding the Tasty Space Griffin and plan to flood the market in order to destabilize it, which they hope will allow them to seize power. Because of an error on part of the notoriously unreliable series seven astroplex, the task to destroy this evil plot rests in the paws of the ill-prepared Captain Rover Pawstrong.<br><br>Players take control of Pawstrong and must help him chase and kill all 20 Space Griffins on (and below) the surface of the moon. The looping playing area is presented from a side-scrolling perspective, with the bottom of the screen showing  a radar indicating the position of Pawstrong and the Space Griffin he is chasing. Pawstrong's health is represented by a cooked Griffin which disappears over time, but gets replenished when a Griffin is caught. The most straight forward and least effective way to catch a Space Griffin is to simply jump on it. It is advisable however, to use some of the items that can be picked up from boxes randomly dropped on the moon's surface by a spaceship. These items include transportation devices like anti-gravity pads or rockets, weapons such as rocket launchers or explosives and food that replenishes some of Pawstrong's health. A mining lamp is needed to see inside the mines under the surface of the moon. Here, Pawstrong can also pick up ammunition for his weapon. When he finds and uses a matter transporter, he is taken to a different part of the moon from where he can attack The Space Griffin with his catapult-style weapon. Finally, a bonus puzzle can be found which requires the player to rearrange a picture, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/split-personalities\">Split Personalities</a>, within a time limit.\n",
