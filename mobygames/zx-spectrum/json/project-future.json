  "description": "Your first mission out of Space College could hardly be tougher - penetrate the SS Future spaceship, and activate its self-destruct function, to prevent it crashing into earth. This means walking through 256 screens of minions, and getting each part of the protection code.<br><br>The droids emerge from particular points of the level, and constantly regenerate, so your path must be precisely navigated. You can collect a suit of armour for protection, improved weaponry (the initial unit only fires horizontally), and a high-speed scooter - each of which last for the next 3 screens. Extra lives can be collected en route.",
