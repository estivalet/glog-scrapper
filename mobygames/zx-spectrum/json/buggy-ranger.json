This is the plot of <i>Buggy Ranger</i>, a side-scrolling shoot'em up, very similar to the &quot;jeep stage&quot; of one of the most famous titles of Dinamic, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/army-moves\">Army Moves</a>.<br><br>The main difference, is that in this case, the turret of our vehicle, can fly and shoot in the air at the enemies.",
