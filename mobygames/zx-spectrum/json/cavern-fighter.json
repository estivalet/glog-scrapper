  "description": "Are you willing to plow through six levels of asteroids, alien ships and defense installations, and finally a Dicator's Lair, so as to save the sleepy English town of Watford? If not, you might be better to pass on this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Scramble\">Scramble</a>-inspired shoot 'em up.<br><br>The caverns you fly through have the standard zig-zag walls, which must be avoided. There are no mid-level restart points, and only three lives, which makes things tougher.",
