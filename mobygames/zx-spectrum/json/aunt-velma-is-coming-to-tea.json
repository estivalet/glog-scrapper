  "description": "<i>Aunt Velma Is Coming to Tea</i> is a humorous text adventure.<br><br>Aunt Velma is your favourite auntie and it's her birthday. She's coming round to  tea and, naturally enough, she's expecting to be given her birthday present. The good news is that you've bought it, the bad news is that you put it in the wardrobe in the spare bedroom and can't remember where the key is.  Aunt Velma is expected in one and a half hours, time to start panicking. <br><br>To make things even worse the fuse has blown and the house is in darkness.The object of the game is to find the present and get the house ready for auntie's visit, not necessarily in that order.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as X for EXAMINE. When completed successfully the player will score 55/55.",
