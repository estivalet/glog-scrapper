  "description": "You are a normal person, finding oneself in the strange world of Piland, a surreal place containing the secret of the wondrous Golden Sundial of Pi. After figuring out how to properly enter Piland, you must find clues to the Sundial's location, with the help (and hindrance) of the Piman, a strange little creature with distinct likes and dislikes. The Sundial is not actually in the game - it was the prize of a contest, won using the clues within the game.",
