  "description": "Cosmic Guerilla is an imitation and a non official version of the arcade <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/cosmic-guerilla\">Cosmic Guerilla</a></i>. Similarly, the player controls a spaceship and has to defend his stationary fleet from being destroyed. The fleet is located on the centre of the screen and is aligned vertically, surrounded laterally by two vertical matrices of shields.  <br><br>There are also present many sets of attackers which are aligned vertically and distributed on both right and left sides of the matrices of shields which are protecting the fleet. These attackers won't fire at none of the player's ships nor at the spaceship the player is commanding, instead they'll try to horizontally take the shields one by one until a spaceship is finally exposed. If a spaceship is taken by an alien, the player looses one life. If the player selects the &quot;Alien Ships&quot; option at the &quot;Game Option&quot; menu, sporadically a flying disc will fly at a very low altitude constantly bombarding the ground. If the playable spaceship is exposed to this bombardment one of the fleet's is immediately lost.",
