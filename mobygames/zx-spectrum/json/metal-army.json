  "description": "General Ironside's Metal Army of thuggish louts has invaded a nuclear power station in Slough and are threatening to blow it up. As <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Joe+Blade%27\">Joe Blade</a> is busy (cross-references to other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Players%27\">Players</a> releases were common in their inlays), freelance heavy Harry Chainsaw is brought in to deactivate their bomb.<br><br>Gameplay is a fairly conventional platform shoot 'em up with maze elements. Your weapon is powerful enough to destroy Ironside's forces, but needs to be recharged regularly. Hazards to be avoided include laser bolts, falling crushers and gas and electric discharges.",
