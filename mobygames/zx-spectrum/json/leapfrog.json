  "description": "<i><b>Leapfrog</b></i> is a single player <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Frogger+variants\">variant of Frogger.</a><br><br><br>The player takes control of a frog sitting by the side of the road. The frog wants to go home but to get there the frog must first cross a busy road and then he must cross a raging river.<br><br>The player can move the frog forwards, backwards, left and to the right. Using these controls the player must take the frog safely across four lanes of traffic travelling in alternate directions at different speeds. If a car or a lorry runs over the frog then that frog is no more.<br><br>Once the frog has crossed the road there's a chance for the player to take a rest before helping the frog cross the river. This frog cannot swim but all is not lost. In the river are lily pads and logs which the current is dragging along in different directions and at different speeds. Unlike the road, where it was important to avoid the traffic, here and the only way to cross the river is to hop from lily pad to log until the other side is reached.<br><br>Should the poor frog mistime his jump and land inn the water, or be swept off the edge of the screen, then that frog is no more.<br><br>At the far bank is a series of bays. In almost every occasion it is important that the frog jumps safely to land. However a dragonfly, the frogs favourite food, sometimes sits in one of these bays and jumping onto the dragonfly scores additional points. Watch out though because the dragonfly is sometimes replaced by an alligator and jumping onto him is as fatal as landing in the water.<br><br>Points are scored for every move forward the frog makes and for getting a frog safely home. \nEach game consists of five frogs and getting all of them home safely scores a bonus, as does catching the dragonfly.<br><br>Once all frogs have got home, the game continues with more frogs and additional hazards including frog-eating snakes and fish.<br><br>",
