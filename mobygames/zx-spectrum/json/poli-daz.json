  "description": "Poli Diaz is a boxing game protagonized by the Spanish boxing star of the late eighties, Policarpio Díaz. This game uses an isometric perspective where two boxers revolve around the center of the ring, with no possibility of going back, and we observe it from a corner of the quadrilateral. The options menu is the usual: one or two player mode, choose the control type and the number of assaults and lenght of the same.<br><br>Our first opponent will be a sparring, that without offering much opposition, will allow us to learn about the control of the game. After this weak opponent is defeated, you will have to fight (in order) for the titles of Spain, Europe and the World against other opponents.<br><br>&quot;Poli Diaz&quot; has two different modes of control, one of attack and other of defence. In the former, and with the appropriate combination of hits and movement, we will attack the contrary, and in the second we will cover of the  punches that undoubtedly fall over us. In this context, using a joystick could be recommendable.",
