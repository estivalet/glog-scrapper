  "description": "<i>The Gordello Incident</i> is a three part text adventure game which, unusually, uses a split screen to control two characters. It has two modes of play, easy and hard. The game starts in 'easy' mode, in this mode the clones are  more likely to volunteer information. The player can switch modes at any time by typing EASIER or HARDER<br><br>The background to the story is centred on Dr Gordello who has been working on cloning techniques, he's the baddie in this tale, and after working on animal experiments the doctor has turned his attentions to cloning humans. The player takes the role of a secret agent and the game starts when your boss receives a video showing the doctor, you and your clone - in other words you are not who you seem to be you're a clone of yourself. <br><br>In part one of the game the player, having been proven to be the real thing, remotely controls two clones into the room that houses the cloning device. This is why the game needs a split screen to control two characters.<br><br>In part two you use the cloning machine to combining the two clones, apparently clones have flaws - for example one of these does the exact opposite of what it is told - but by combining clones you eliminate the flaws and produce a super clone capable of speech.<br><br>In part three the player uses one side of the screen to control their super clone and the other to control any of fourteen other characters, the objective being to kill the doctor and thwart his evil plans. Upon completion of part three of the game there's an additional piece of the story and some puzzle games.<br><br>The clones are identified as A and B and typing either of these letters will switch control between them. I will show the inventory for the current clone but I OF PORTER will show what another game character, in this case the porter, is carrying. M, for Mulligan, is used to withdraw a move. All commands can be abbreviated to five letters.",
