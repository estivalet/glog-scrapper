  "description": "<i>Final Assault</i> is a mountain climbing action/simulation game. The object of the game is to climb to the peak of a mountain via several different trails of varying difficulty. Progress is made in a fashion similar to that used in Epyx 'games' series, with alternating joystick movements. To help out, you carry a backpack which you may stock with assorted items. Since there is a weight limit, you must choose which items you most likely will need for a given trail. For example, an exceptionally long trail may require camping gear and some additional food, where as a short trail will allow for some more luxuries such as extra rope.",
