  "description": "The activities of the RAF's famous aircraft display team are brought to life in this simulation. The player can take part in loops, rolls and flypasts, working in tandem with friendly pilots as little as 6ft away, flying at over 300 miles per hour. <br><br>Instructions are given in-flight; follow the requested height and direction to maximise the visual appeal of the routine and to avoid collisions. Thrust and steering can be automated in flight; this invokes a scoring penalty but allows new players to master the more complex functions.",
