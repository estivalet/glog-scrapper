  "description": "Escalador Loco is, as its title indicates (literally, a Spanish translation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Crazy+Climber\">Crazy Climber</a>), an unofficial version of the classic game designed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,62342/\">Shigeki Fujiwara</a>. As in Crazy Climber, our courageous protagonist must reach the top of the skyscraper while at the same time trying to avoid the objects that fall from above. In order to reach the top our hero must use the windows, but it will not be an easy task, as we should also avoid that the window we are grasping closes in front of us, otherwise he would fall to the ground and our mission would fail.",
