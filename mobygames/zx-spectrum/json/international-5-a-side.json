  "description": "This game aims to recreate five-a-side football as accurately as possible, from a side-on forced perspective. The main tournament involves 8 international teams, with 2 skill levels and variable match lengths.<br><br>Five a side football differs from the full game in many ways. The teams consist of 4 outfield players and a goalkeeper – the outfield players can’t encroach into the goal area (which is a semi-circle rather than a rectangle). The arena is walled, making judging ricochets important, and the ball can’t be hit above head height.\n",
