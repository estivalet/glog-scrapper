  "description": "<i>Tribble Trubble</i> is a loosely inspired by the <i>Star Trek</i> (original series - back in 1984 it was the only series) episode &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot;. It sets you as Tribble farmer Brian Skywalker as he attempts to safely guide his newest Tribbles back to his farm. Tribbles attempt to follow Brian, but they move slowly so care must be taken. <br><br>The game takes place across five single-screen levels. Each contains much that the Tribbles must be protected from. Your time is limited by the amount of available air. First, put out volcanic fires using the hidden gems. Secondly, enter the Goofer desert to feed them, while keeping them safe from cacti (the only thing on any level which can directly harm Brian). Then, keep them safe from Spheroids using tin-tacks. Then, help the Tribbles to eat their favoured spinning mushrooms while avoiding Snappers. Finally, upon returning to your base you must bring back the many escaped Tribbles.",
