  "description": "Target Plus requires that you have the Gun Stick accessory. It means that your success will depend on whether you have a good shot or not. Game options will be selected with a shot as well.<br><br>This game consists of two parts which can be played independently, all of being related to aim shooting. The second part does include a 1 or 2 players mode.<br><br>In the first part you will have to shot at plates flying in the air, accounting for a total of 12, if you hit at least 6 the you will pass to the next round of this first part. You have 3 shots for every two plates, so you have to be effective on a regular basis. Once you have passed this round, you will have to aim at a total of 7 targets, your goal is to hit at least 3 of them, here you only have one shot available for each objective. If you are lucky enough, the stage will be restarted with increased difficulty.<br><br>In the second part of the game your objective will be to protect a juicy cooked chicken to be mercilessly attacked by spiders or voracious wasps that emerge from everywhere. Your mission would be to shot at them before they can absorb its substance till just leaving the bones. But it will not be easy, as time goes on insects will be more numerous, so if you find it pertinent, you can request the help from a second player. Do not let them spoil your dish...",
