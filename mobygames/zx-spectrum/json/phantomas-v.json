  "description": "<i>Phantomas V</i> is a fangame starring the android thief character from the 1986 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas\">Phantomas</a>. It is the third fangame based on the franchise by the developer. Phantomas hears a rumour in a space bar about treasure hidden in the Forest of the Canutos and decides to hunt it down.<br><br>This 2D game consists of a single level formed through several single-screen rooms linked both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen with some freedom for exploration. It consists of two parts. In the first part Phantomas infiltrates a location known as the Storm Palace. It consists of abandoned ruins guarded by androids and native trolls known as Brutihimos. The player takes Phantomas through several rooms with platforming sections. He has to avoid enemies as he has no means of attack and can only jump. Starting with five lives, every encounter with an enemy makes him lose one right away. There are also some hazards such as acid drops that need to be dodged and lava pits.<br><br>The second part takes place in the Forest of the Canutos. There the treasure needs to be located and once collected Phantomas needs to escape the location.<br><br>In the same year a revision was released with some changes for the graphics and the overall design.",
