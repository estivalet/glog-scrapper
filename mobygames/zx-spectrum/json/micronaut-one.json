  "description": "<i>Micronaut One</i> is an action game using 3D vector graphics, where the player races through tunnels.<br><br>The player is a robot who flies through tunnels of a biocomputer which is infested with aliens. Alien eggs become crawling larvae, which turn into jelly fish and then into black eggs which form energy-draining webs and new eggs, which go through the whole cycle again. The objective is to rid the tunnels of Scrim and keep the energy balance in the biocomputer.",
