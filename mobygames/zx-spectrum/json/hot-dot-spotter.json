  "description": "<i>Hot Dot Spotter</i> is an educational title developed with the aim of teaching four to eight year olds number recognition and counting skills.<br><br>After a brief flurry of introduction screens the game invites the player to enter their name after which the player presses 'P' to start a game. The game consists of a border, or dot dropper, at the top of the screen from which any one of four spheres may drop. These spheres contain a number of dots and the player must count these dots and press the corresponding number key. If they are unsuccessful the ball falls to the bottom of the screen where the number of spots are counted for the players benefit. If they are successful a snooker cue comes in from the side of the screen which knocks the sphere off to the left of the screen and points are scored. As the spheres fall they pass through three coloured zones, hitting the correct key while the sphere is in the yellow zone scores three points, the pink zone scores two and the green zone scores just one.<br><br>The game is entirely keyboard controlled, it continues until the player has lost three lives. A high score for the gaming session is maintained but it is not preserved from one session to the next.\n",
