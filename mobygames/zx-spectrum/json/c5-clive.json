  "description": "The C5 electric car wasn't a huge success for Sir Clive Sinclair, and it largely undid the reputation he'd built up from inventions such as the Spectrum. This budget-price game wasn't the only one to gently mock it. You star as Clive aboard the car, and must travel through a succession of screens, which alternate between two different styles.<br><br>The odd-numbered levels involve dodging hazards including trees, ghosts and brick walls to collect batteries - contact with any of these costs you a life. The objects are drawn as if 3D, but contact with any part of them is costly. The even-numbered levels play like a simplified Moon Patrol, as Clive must jump over cars and pedestrians.",
