The player with the most seconds takes part in the final round where those seconds are the time they have available to compete.\nThere are six blocks of questions so the game can be played six times before some categories come up a second time.\nThe game consists of:<ul>\n<li>Round 1: True or False<br>\nThis round consists of nine True / False questions. Player 1 from each team takes it in turn to answer a question. A correct answer gains the player's team two points, an incorrect answer scores nothing and knocks the team out of this round.
