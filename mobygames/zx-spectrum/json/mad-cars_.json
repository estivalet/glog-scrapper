  "description": "Mad Cars is a very simple top down vertical scrolling racing game.<br><br>In this game you control a racing car and you race along a road avoiding obstacles such as water on the track which makes you skid. Any contact with another car or the sides of the track is instantly fatal.\nThe road is dead straight all the time but occasionally it narrows and widens fractionally. The roadside scenery does change, it starts as a race track, later it becomes a bridge over water, there's a section through farmland, and another through desert, then the scenery starts to repeat.<br><br>The does not seem to have an end, a final destination. The object of the game seems to be to drive for as long as possible to set a high score. <br><br>",
