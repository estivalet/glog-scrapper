  "description": "<i>Astro Blaster</i> is an unofficial adaptation of the arcade <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/astro-blaster\">Astro Blaster</a>, a traditional spacial shoot-em-up game which combines some elements of arcade classics such as <i>Galaxians</i> and <i>Asteroids</i>, also including the concept of a final &quot;boss&quot; as the passage for the next level. The player manoeuvres an armoured spaceship on a left/right axis while floating on deep space. The arsenal of the spaceship is capable of completely destroying an enemy with a single shot. Each stage is constituted by 2 sets of 5 different enemy armadas, a meteor storm and the final boss: a heavy armoured giant Asteroidal spaceship. Also in the traditional arcade line, after you succeed completing the 5 armadas, the process repeats itself turning the game-play increasingly more difficult after each stage is complete.",
