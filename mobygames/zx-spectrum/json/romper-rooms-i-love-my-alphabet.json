  "description": "<i>Romper Room's I Love My Alphabet</i> is an educational game based on the American children TV series Romper Room which at the time had been on the air for 30 years. Aimed at children ages 2-7 it attempts to teach the alphabet, vocabulary, concentration, cause and effect and basic word association concepts. The player is accompanied by Max, an animated character that resembles a tomato on legs.<br><br>The game consists of four activities:\n<ul>\n\t<li><i>Watch the letters</i> which is a passive introduction to the letters in the alphabet. The player simply looks on as Max introduces each of the letters. For each letter Max will do an act (for example dance on d) which is then described with a simple sentence. </li>\n\t<li><i>Press a letter</i> allows the player to press a letter on the keyboard and Max will then act out that letter. </li>\n\t<li><i>Find the letter</i> has Max selecting a letter and the player then has to press the correct key on the keyboard. If the right one is picked Max will act out the letter.</li>\n\t<li><i>Letter Quiz</i> has Max doing one of his acts and the player will then have to recognize it and enter the corresponding letter. </li>\n</ul>",
