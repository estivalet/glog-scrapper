After choosing your team you presented with a number of options that allow you to see your fixtures, squad, tables, medical and other options. You are also able to select friendly games in between your qualifying matches. Once you have looked at various options you then go on to your first game.

The match itself shows the whole pitch with the scoreboard on the right hand side. You watch the ball move around the pitch with major incidents are shown by text. The game speed is selected before the match (1-10) and you can choose one of your subs at any time of the match.",
