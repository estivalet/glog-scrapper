  "description": "<i>A Legacy For Alaric</i> is a single player, fantasy, text adventure in which the player takes the role of a young lad who's a member of The Adventurer's Guild. It seems that the wizard Emril is dying of old age and wants to pass on his legacy to his nephew Alaric. The problem is that Alaric is being held prisoner in an island castle on lake Moira. That's the task - the reward is 10% of the legacy (less guild fees of 70%), off you go.<br><br>The game marks the player's progress by awarding points after key events, the full game scores one hundred and fifty points. Making a bad decision ends the game requiring the player to start again.<br><br>This story is continued in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/magic-isle\">The Magic Isle</a> which was released separately, in some compilations the two are released as a combined game with <i>A Legacy For Alaric</i> being Part One and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/magic-isle\">The Magic Isle</a> being Part Two.
