  "description": "The Changchun Academy was one of the most prestigious karate schools in ancient China. But when the evil Wang Chen, a disgruntled former student, attacks the school, all pupils and masters are slaughtered. Only young Yo Lin survives and takes with him the academy's sacred scrolls. Now, Wang Chen dispatches his finest warriors to retrieve the scrolls while Yo Lin decides to travel from Changchun to Shanghai to confront Wang Chen.<br><br><i>Shanghai Karate</i> is a one-on-one beat 'em up. Yo Lin must beat one opponent each in four levels, including Chinese landmarks the Great Wall, the Yangtze river and the Loyang caves, and, for the confrontation with Wang Chen, the mysterious Dragon temple. Every level can be selected from the main menu from the start.<br><br>A fight begins with each combatant having four lives, the goal being to deprive the enemy of all four by pushing them off the edge of the screen or depleting their health bar. The game employs eight joystick directions and the fire button for 16 different moves, including kicks, punches, sweeps and blocks.<br><br>The game also offers a practise mode and a two-player option, both taking place on the Great Wall level.",
