  "description": "<i>Viking Raiders</i> is a turn-based war game. A mixture of up to four computer and human players can control the Viking armies in the game, were they sail boats down the fjord conquering the enemy castles. Units consist of vikings, longboats and catapults that can be fired at the enemy. Treasure chests and drinking horns are scattered round the map. Units can be bought for gold where more gold can be obtained by carrying treasure chests back to your castle. If a drinking horn is emptied by a viking, it makes him behave in an unpredictable manner.  A faction is defeated if the castle is conquered by an enemy army and all the units of the defeated side are transferred to the victor.",
