  "description": "After a terrible confrontation between forces of evil from another universe and the elves, dwarves, and animals, the seeds of the mother of all trees were lost. The only being knowing where to find the seeds, without which nothing will grow, is the elfin princess Edora. Your task is to find and rescue the princess from the Volcanic Dungeon, where the witch Magra, the last member of the evil alliance, holds her captive.<br><br><i>Volcanic Dungeon</i> has the same basic gameplay as a <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Rogue\">Rogue</a></i>-like dungeon crawler, but with a text adventure interface. You start the game at an unidentified spot in the dungeon, and must find your way using a map in the manual. The dungeon is filled with fiery pits and wandering monsters. In the different chambers, you find weapons and equipment necessary to fight the enemy. All the while, you must manage your water supply (if you manage to find the princess, it diminishes twice as fast). A magic ring displayed on-screen tells you how strong the witch is.<br><br>All controls use single keys and your inventory is also displayed as single letters, just as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hack\">Hack</a> and similar games.",
