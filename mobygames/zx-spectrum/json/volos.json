  "description": "Originally made for annual <i>comp.sys.sinclair Crap Game Compo</i>, <i>Volos</i> is a small and very basic game (even programmed in BASIC) where you as the ancient Slavonic god of cattle and fertility, Volos (represented by a bull's head) must attract cows into a hole and then land on them. The cow's market (?) value varies constantly, and pressing the attract button at the right moment is vital to quickly increasing your score. Your score is multiplied by your vicinity to the cow, but don't fall into the hole before the cow!",
