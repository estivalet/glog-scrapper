  "description": "<i>The Secret Of Little Hodcome</i> is a text adventure from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Zenobi+Software\">Zenobi Software</a> with mild horror elements. <br><br>Once upon a time the player had a distant, and forgotten relative. That relative is no more meaning that the player has inherited a cottage in the tiny hamlet of Little Hodcome. After a bit of not-too-productive research, 'Where is this place?', off you trot to meet the estate agent.<br><br>Naturally, this being an adventure, all is not well in the English countryside and the object of the game is to uncover and vanquish whatever evil force lurks there.<br><br>This game was developed using the <i>Quill Adventure System</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as X for EXAMINE, I for Inventory, R for REDESCRIBE and L for Look. The player's progress through the game is scored as points on the 'Defeat The Demon' meter.",
