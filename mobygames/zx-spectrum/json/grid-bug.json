  "description": "<i>Grid Bug</i> is an action game that is played on a grid that consists of a large number of squares each containing a patch of grass. The player controls the titular bug and has to eat all the grass. This is done by simply moving over the square and the grass will disappear. However if the bug moves over a square a second time the grass will grow back. To make things harder there are also other creatures running around over the grid and these have to be avoided or a life will be lost. There are four lives and the game ends when they are all gone. After emptying all squares the game moves on to the next level which has more hostile creatures. ",
