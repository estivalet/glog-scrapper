  "description": "<i>Brum Brum</i> is one of the earliest Formula 1 management games. Six teams compete; anything from one to six players can take part in guiding them to glory. Before each race you can buy upgrades and repairs to components such as the engine, chassis and suspension. Races are viewed from a top-down perspective of the start-finish line. After each race, extra points and funds are awarded based on the result.",
