  "description": "There is no food left on earth, and none of the previous expeditions into space have retrieved any, perhaps due to the marauding alien races guarding it. Your job is to be the hero who brings back enough food transporters to help people survive. There are 15 star systems to search, and successful voyages through these will push your rank up through the 11 available.<br><br>A radar is provided to help you identify enemy ships, as well as more precise co-ordinates relative to the targeted ship. The status of your fuel load, ammunition and shields are constantly measured.  <br><br>To obtain food (and refuel and replenish supplies), you must land on a planet and roam the surface, at which point the view changes from 3D to top-down, and the gameplay takes on a mazey aspect.",
