  "description": "<i>Zblast SD</i> is a top-view, single screen shooter where you control a spacecraft and have to destroy various waves of alien ships to amass a high score with your cannon. You can move your craft around the screen, and as the aliens move around the screen they will fire missiles at you. If you hit an alien ship or its missile then you lose part of your energy which starts at thirty, and once it reaches zero then it is game over. when all the aliens are destroyed on the screen then the next wave of aliens appear but you do get ten energy points added to your total.
