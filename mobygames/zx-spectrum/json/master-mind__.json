  "description": "<i>Master Mind</i> is an adaptation of the eponymous board game. The goal is to guess a random code of four pegs, each peg being one of six or seven (player choice) colors. The player enters his guess, and is told how many pegs are of the right color but in the wrong place, and how many pegs are both of the right color and in the right place. <br><br>For monochrome monitors, the player can choose the pegs to be marked with numbers instead of colors.
