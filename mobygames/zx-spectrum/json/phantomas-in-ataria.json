  "description": "<i>Phantomas in Ataria</i> is a fangame starring the android thief character from the 1986 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas\">Phantomas</a>. This 2D game consists of a single level formed through several single-screen rooms linked both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen with some freedom for exploration. Phantomas needs to locate and pick up hostages. He starts with 128 health and needs to avoid some hazards, but there are no enemies. Phantomas can move around freely using a thrust-mechanic that launches him from his feet upwards. This drains fuel and cannot be refilled, so Phantomas needs to locate all hostages before he is out of fuel. 1000 units of fuel are provided at the start. Next to the flying there are also several sections where he can just walk around.",
