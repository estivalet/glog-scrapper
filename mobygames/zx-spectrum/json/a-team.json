  "description": "Your assignment consists in guiding The A-Team through two dangerous missions. On the first operation you will have to travel to the Morania desert in order to reduce a dangerous group of Arab terrorists who have met in an abandoned town. On the second one, you will have to destroy a military base located in Tirania, where an invasion of the neighboring countries is being prepared. In order to carry out so difficult missions you count with a modern N-16 A2 rifle gunner with telescope sight, 2 shippers of 50 bullets each one and 2 long-reach pumps, although in the course of the combat you will be able to acquire more ammunition. Sometimes you will see dynamite charges deposited in the ground; an accurate firing on them will end with every object or person on the screen. Also you will be able to shoot to boats, which will provide you an extra dose of energy.",
