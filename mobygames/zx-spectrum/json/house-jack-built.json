  "description": "After collecting heaps of treasures from his previous two adventures, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jack+%2b+Beanstalk\">Jack and the Beanstalk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tapfere\">Giant's Revenge</a>, Jack was able to afford his own house which has several rooms, some basement rooms and caves, a garden, a large maze, and even a roof that leads up to the moon where there are more locations to explore. Jack arrives at the living room and has to go around the house collecting objects. All this luxury comes at a price for Jack; his pets do not like his new house and have gone amok. Jack must be careful not to get in their way.<br><br>Unlike the other two games, the player is free to go wherever they like, not just on a very narrow, preset path. If the player touches any pets, this will result in a loss of life. In this case, Jack returns to the location where he died, instead of having to start over. The score is by percentage of collected objects.\n",
