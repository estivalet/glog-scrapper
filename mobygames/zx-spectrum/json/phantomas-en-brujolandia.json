  "description": "<i>Phantomas en Brujolandia</i> is a fangame starring the android thief character from the 1986 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas\">Phantomas</a>. It is the second fangame for the franchise by the developer and a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas-infinito\">Phantomas Infinito</a>. From an old merchant in Dunnada he finds out that the moon Salem is in danger. Evil witches have flown in and locked up the patriarch, sending the population into the mines to work for them.<br><br>This 2D game consists of a single level formed through several single-screen rooms linked both horizontally using the flip-screen. In the first part Phantomas needs to cross the witches' garden in search of a flying broom. The player takes him through several rooms with platforming sections. He has to avoid enemies as he has no means of attack and can only jump. Starting with three lives, every encounter with an enemy makes him lose one right away. He also has to watch out not to fall down gaps or to get hit by lasers, timing carefully to get past them.<br><br>Once the broom has been found a second part starts. Phantomas can fly again avoiding the witches. Once he reaches the dungeon he proceeds again on foot until he can free the patriarch guarded by the witches.",
