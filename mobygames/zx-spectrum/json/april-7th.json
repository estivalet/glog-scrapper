  "description": "<i>April 7th</i> is a text adventure game.<br><br>Well, it finally happened. The world as we know it has gone. Luckily the player of this game was a skilled programmer with the Northern District Civil Police and that got you a room in the Municipal Shelter. The Twelve Hour War came and went. Years passed and time weighed heavily on the survivors below ground so, on April 5th, you lock the door to your room and take a bottle of tranquilisers.\n<br>\nOn April 7th you wake up and it's very, very quiet. Something's not right<br><br>This game supports the standard commands such as GET and DROP together with shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West. It also supports Save/Load functions. The game was developed using <i>The Quill</i> authoring system.\n",
