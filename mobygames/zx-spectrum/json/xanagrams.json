  "description": "<i>Xanagams</i> is a single player educational word game that is something like a cross between cross-words and scrabble.<br><br>The game consists of a series of interlinked words in a crossword style grid. The player is supplied with all the letters that comprise these words and the object of the game is to place the letters correctly onto the play area to complete the words. Points are awarded for correctly placing a letter and are lost for either placing a letter incorrectly or asking the game to reveal what the correct letter in a given location is.<br><br>There are three levels of difficulty which are said to be for 'junior school children', 'senior school children' and 'adults and brighter children', and a game can consist of 1 - 5 words.<br><br>\n",
