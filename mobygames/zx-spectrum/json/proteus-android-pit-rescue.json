  "description": "<i>Proteus + Android Pit Rescue</i> is a compilation of 2 games that belong to the sci-fi genre.<br> \n<i>Proteus</i> was originally published as part of this compilation and <i>Android Pit Rescue</i> originally as part of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/games-pack-1\">Games Pack 1</a>.<br><br><h3>Proteus</h3>\n<i>Proteus</i> is a shoot'em-up game where strategy is a fundamental factor in the development and main goals of the game. <br><br>It takes place in a quadrant of an enemy galaxy which is divided by a matrix of sectors covered in planetary debris and patrolled by hostile extraterrestrial entities. <br><br>In each of the sectors located near the corners of the quadrant there are 4 transmitters that are part of the enemy's communications system.<br><br>\nThe main goal is to destroy the transmitters and clear a specific path made out of a straight chain of sectors, removing the dangers of the planetary debris and the attacks of the enemy spaceships. This will allow the drone's armada to pass through the quadrant and reach the planet where the debris is orbiting safely.<br><br>The drone the player commands is entitled <i>Proteus</i> (Deep Space Pilotless Probe) and it has two types of weapons: guided missiles and linear Photons. <i>Proteus</i> is also armed with a booster allowing the player to escape in critical situations if correctly navigated.<br><br>There are several strategic factors which have to be taken into account as the limits of fuel and missiles, the use of debris as shields and the conjugation of weapons allowing the use of diversion tactics.<br><br>A map of the quadrant can also be viewed, allowing the identification of sectors patrolled by alien ships (magenta), the localization of the communication transmitters (yellow), the sectors and the path the drone's armada shall pass through (pointed horizontally by two arrows in green located in each opposite extremities of the map) and the debris in each sector that is obstructing the passage.<br><br>On each of the sectors that is already devoid of enemy ships or cleansed of them, the player has to be very careful because potentially or in a short period of time a hunting alien ship will appear and it will relentlessly launch guided missiles against the player's drone.<br><br>As soon as the player has concluded both objectives and lost all of his drones, the game is over and the mission is complete.<br><br><h3>Android Pit Rescue</h3>\nIn <i>Android Pit Rescue</i> the player commands an android that was created to save trapped miners from the mines of the planet <i>Zarqon</i> in the event of flooding.<br><br>There are constant fluxes of water which may flood and freeze certain parts of the mine maze paths. The miners and the android wear safe suits and are protected from the waves of water if standing still, but although the android is coated with a special repellant he still cannot move in water without being destroyed.<br><br>To succeed in his task the android has to rescue all the miners by carrying them one by one to the surface which is represented by the upper part of the screen.",
