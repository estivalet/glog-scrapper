  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Marble+Construction+Set\">Marble Madness Construction Set</a> gave enthusiasts of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marble-madness\">Marble Madness</a> a chance to create their own layouts that was not seen in any of the other home versions. However, it lacked a direct conversion of the arcade's level designs, which is where this <i>Deluxe Edition</i> comes in. Alongside an improved version of the construction set, the original game is converted, although without multicoloured graphics.",
