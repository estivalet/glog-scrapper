  "description": "Eight planets have been infected by a strange weed planted by an alien life form. The weed is sucking the life out of the planet and needs to be destroyed. You control a ship with Agent Orange on board which when planted will kill the weed. When you land on a planet you can see the killer weed growing. Alien fighters try and stop you sowing Agent Orange. Any fighter destroyed leave behind a seed. Collect the seeds but be careful as carrying too many seeds cause your ship to crash.<br><br><i>Agent Orange</i> is a horizontally scrolling top down view shoot-em-up. You can move the screen left and right. The joystick steers the ship while the fire button shoots your weapons. Holding down the fire button releases the Agent Orange. ",
