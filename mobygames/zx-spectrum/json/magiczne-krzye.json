  "description": "<i>Magiczne Krzy?e</i> (Magical Crosses) is a puzzle game, taking place on a 5 by 5 board. The board squares are white, red or blue; the goal of the game is to attain a maximum number of points by making the entire board white. The game doesn't acknowledge the player's victory on its own. <br><br>Gameplay is similar to a &quot;Lights Out&quot; puzzle, in that the player makes moves by recoloring several board squares at once; in this case, the player can &quot;place&quot; five-square crosses on the board. There are three colors--red, blue and white. The colors interfere with each other based on a set of rules; for example, placing a red cross will change affected white squares to blue, blue squares to white, and leave the red squares unchanged. <br><br>There are 17 levels to choose from at any time. The game allows saving and restoring a game state, whether in memory or on tape, undoing the last move, and reviewing the moves made so far. ",
