  "description": "You are riding your BMX along a road that can't be stopped and must avoid all obstacles for as long as possible. The game is viewed from above with the screen scrolling continuously upwards and you can use a joystick or keyboard to control the bike. Various obstacles appear as you ride and these include moving cars, other bike riders, oil patches and a granny who throws her stick at you. If you touch any of these obstacles then you lose one of three lives. There are no levels and you keep riding until you lose all your lives.",
