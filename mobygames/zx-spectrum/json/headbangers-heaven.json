  "description": "<i>Headbangers Heaven</i> is a variation of an early computer game, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/vic-20/money-wars\">Money Wars</a>.<br><br>Poor Chico the Headbanger has to collect bags of money while avoiding a shower of hammers falling from the sky.\nChico goes left and right to pick up the bags of money from the right side and stashes them at the left side of the screen. Direct hammer hits to the head raise Chico's pain meter, but hits to the arms and body are fatal. But even Chico can take too much and ten hits to the head result in a knockout.<br><br>Blocks of protection are in between Chico and the hammers at the start of the level, each hammer hit eroding it in a similar way to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Arcade\">Space Invaders</a>, but only in reverse. Catching a falling aspirin tablet in the VIC20 version or a red hammer filled with aspirin in the Spectrum version will reset the headache and reduce the pain meter to zero. An aspirin collected while the pain meter is maxed out, will result in hefty score bonus. The higher the pain meter is while returning the money, the higher the score will be for returning it.",
