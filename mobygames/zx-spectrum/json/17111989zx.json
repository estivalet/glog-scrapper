  "description": "<i>17.11.1989</i> is an interactive fiction adventure game, created in Czechoslovakia as a protest against the events of November 17, 1989 (the beginning of the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot;) when a student demonstration in Prague was brutally suppressed by the riot police. The object of the game is to avoid the police cordon, find a video camera and a tape in an apartment building, then film evidence of police brutality from an unseen spot. <br><br>The game is controlled by typing in one-letter commands in order to walk around, explore areas, pick up and use inventory items, or wait in place. Careless behavior may result in the protagonist getting captured and beaten by police. ",
