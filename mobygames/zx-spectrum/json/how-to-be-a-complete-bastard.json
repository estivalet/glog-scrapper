  "description": "This game is based around cult ‘alternative comedian’ Ade Edmondson’s book of the same name. Having gate-crashed a party full of sophisticated well-behaved types, you must do everything you can to be seen as hateful, yobbish and immature – a Complete Bastard.<br><br>The house has several rooms, each of which are filled with objects which are of use, as well as unlimited supplies of food, alcohol and coffee, which control how drunk you are at a time – some awful actions force you to be sober, others force you to be drunk. The game also displays whether you need the toilet (or, more accurately, any part of the house that would cause offence), whether you need to fart, and how strong-smelling these are.<br><br>The rooms can all be viewed from multiple angles, and 2 can be viewed at a time through a split-screen view.<br><br>To win, you need to prove to all 16 party guest that you are a complete bastard.\n",
