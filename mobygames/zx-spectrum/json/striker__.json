  "description": "You are a 18 year old striker playing for a team in the English 4th Division and your aim is to help your team get promoted to the 1st Division and win domestic and European trophies or move to other teams as you work your way up in a career that will end at age 34. You can also play for European teams and play International football. Before each game you can train or speak to your agent about transfers or a better contract. The actual game views a goal area and goal with a clock ticking away and the score changing if a goal is scored. Occasionally you are able to take a shot at goal. A bar representing the angle of your shot keeps moving and you press the S key to stop the bar. You take a shot and hopefully you score. At the end of the game you get a managers report.",
