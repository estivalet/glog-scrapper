  "description": "<i>Diablo!</i> is a single player, science fiction, text adventure. It was released in two forms within the same package, one tape had a version suited to the Spectrum 48K while on another tape was a version for the Spectrum 128K, both versions had graphics. <br><br>The story behind the game starts with the missing spaceship Discovery being found floating in space. It seems abandoned but one of the rescue team claims to have seen the devil on board.<br>The player takes a four person team aboard the discovery to investigate what happened to it and can switch between the characters with the command 'CONTROL XXXXX' as they investigate. <i>Diablo!</i> is a three part game, the investigation covers three decks of the ship with each deck corresponding to a different section of the game. The parts cannot be played out of sequence as they require passwords which are revealed at the end of the preceding section.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as more advanced commands such as RAMSAVE and RAMLOAD. More unusually there is an OOPS command which undoes the last move, an AGAIN command which repeats the last order and a RADIO command which allows characters who are in different locations to communicate.<br>Instructions can be given to anyone who will accept them, the manual has the following example 'SAY TO RUSSELL &quot;FOLLOW LAWSON.&quot;\n",
