  "description": "A skilled hunter has found the territory of the mysterious Yeti. The problem: the beast lives in an area forbidden to outsiders. To capture the abominable snowman, the hunter, armed only with a Lee Enfield rifle and several grenades,  must battle both weather and terrain and overcome deadly obstacles and mysterious enemies intent on killing him. <br><br><i>Yeti</i> is a flick screen side view game in which the hunter has to complete four levels before he can catch the yeti. Ammunition for rifle and grenades is limited, but can be refilled through pick ups. Also available are shields, which temporarily protect the hunter from (almost) any harm. The cold weather will continually lower the hero's body temperature until he freezes to death. It can be returned to normal by picking up vials of a mystical fluid. Later in the game, the hero can mount a ski bike, making further progress much easier.",
