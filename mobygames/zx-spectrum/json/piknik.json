The task of the player requires protecting picnic food against hungry ants by stomping the ants by using a foot.<br><br>If four ants come to the fruit, they will carry it away and the game will end. While crushing the ants the players must watch for butterflies, as stepping on one blocks the leg and allow ants to take safe passage to anthill.",
