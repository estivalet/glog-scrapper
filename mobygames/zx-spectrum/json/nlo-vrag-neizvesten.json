  "description": "This is an unofficial adaptation of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/x-com-ufo-defense\">UFO: Enemy Unknown</a></i>. The premise is very much the same: at its core, it's a tactical strategy game that's surrounded by various managing elements. <br><br>Extraterrestrial forces try to abduct humans and induce world panic, and you try to shoot their saucers down and then deal with the visitors. <br><br>This ZX-Spectrum &quot;port&quot; recreates much of the original game features: there's, of course the globe, base building, technology research, 3D-cursor and even UFOpedia. The interface is similar as well. <br><br>However, there's one important difference - the ground battles are done in real-time and you can only control one soldier at a time, unlike the original game. There are different locales around the world, including both Earth settlements and the downed spaceships.<br><br>Graphic-wise, &quot;tactical&quot; battles use monochrome isometric mode like in Ultimate's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Filmation\">Filmation engine</a>, while the rest of the game is in color.",
