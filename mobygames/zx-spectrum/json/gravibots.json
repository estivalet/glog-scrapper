  "description": "Gravibots is a platform game with elements of puzzle-solving and management. The main goal is to destroy all of the roaming bots present on each scenario by luring them into the pointed sides of the spikes which are distributed at specific points of the screen.<br><br>The only way to do this is to make use of both the fixed (in magenta) and the transportable (in green) gravitational traps which if placed or used correctly, will thrust the robots against the deadly side of the spikes. The portable traps may only be transported and used once. After being used they'll become magenta.<br><br>The scenarios are affected by gravitational forces which allow the player and the bots to move through both surfaces of the platforms without falling. If they are positioned at the lower sides of the platforms the vertical axis of the commands will be inverted.The gravitational traps may also be used to strategically thrust the bots between the surfaces of the platforms.",
