  "description": "<i>Sunbucket</i> is an &quot;action puzzle&quot; platform game. In each level you must use your warm plasma field to active all the lightbulbs platforms to advance to the next level, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=miner-2049er\">Miner 2049er</a>.<br><br>Avoid running into the enemies that patrol the levels. There are three enemy types, the  merciless chaser, happy wanderer and metronomic patroller. Pickup all four jars with letters to spell MORE for extra lives. Other elements include ladders, breakable platforms, one-way conveyor belt platforms, platforms that toggle on and off, and occasionally a lit lightbulb breaks so you usually need to relight one or two per level. There are 40 levels in total with a password after each 10 levels.<br><br>Technically this game is implemented using the NIRVANA Engine, which allows the ZX-Spectrum to display full-screen multicolor (combining more colours than normally possible without colour clash).",
