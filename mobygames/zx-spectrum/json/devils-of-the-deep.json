  "description": "<b><i>Devils Of The Deep</i></b> is a single player game with keyboard controls.<br><br><b>The plot</b><br>\nThe player takes on the rope if an intrepid explorer whose mission is to explore Atlantis, find its treasures, and take them back to his salvage vessel.<br><br><b>The Game</b><br>\nThere are 100 separate screens to explore and the player can move between them by walking off-screen to the right or to the left, the edges of the game area / seabed are bounded by deep water trenches and are therefore impassible. \nOn the sea bed are crabs, seaweed, treasure and the tools needed to complete the mission. Find an oxygen cylinder and your character can stay underwater longer, find a knife and they can cut seaweed and eat it to maintain their strength, find a spade and they can excavate, fins a harpoon and they can defeat the giant electric eels who give the game it's name.\nNavigation is controlled by the direction keys, and there are specific keys for picking things up, checking the inventory etc. A speed up key is available but only works if there are less than three items in the inventory.<br><br><br><br>",
