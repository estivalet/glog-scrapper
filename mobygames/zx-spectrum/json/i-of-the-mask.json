  "description": "In <i>I, of the Mask</i> the player controls a 2D character placed over a 3D background, where the goal is to navigate around a maze while collecting parts in order to build a robot. These parts need to be collected in a preset order, promoting exploration. Upon reaching certain parts of the maze, the player is confronted with a choice. Three crystals show up, each allowing for a different bonus action: one will move the player to another similar junction, the other will move the player to a different section of the maze, and the final one will allow for all robot parts at that maze junction to be gathered.",
