  "description": "<i>Puckman</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> variant. The player controls a human who has been trapped in a maze. Scattered around the maze is food that the player has to eat as much as possible of. If not the player's energy level will decrease as he moves around. The maze is protected by guardians who will attempt to stop the player from stealing their food. Around the maze magic strawberries can be found. When eating these the guardians begin to glow and the player is able to eat them. There are a few different maze layouts and they can be different for each new game. A difference from other Pac-Man variants is that the mazes have some dead ends. The ZX81 version has three mazes while the Spectrum version has four or twelve mazes depending on amount of memory. The Spectrum version also have lemons which are worth more points.",
