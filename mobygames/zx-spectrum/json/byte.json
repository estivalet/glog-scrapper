  "description": "<i>Byte</i> is a computer themed text adventure game. The player enters a maze and has to retrieve the ten computer circuits needed to construct a computer system and then find a way home. The circuits that needs to be found include four language cards, two interfaces, a printer, a disk driver, a monitor and a teletext module. The circuits are randomly located in boxes, caches and other places. Some of the hiding places have evil circuits that weaken the player's traits. To help in finding only the good ones, a map and an estimate circuit can be used, but only after they have been located. Interaction is done by entering abbreviations, for example 'o' to open box and 'p' to pick up an item.<br><br>At the same time the player has to avoid getting killed by the monsters that are sent by the mighty computer Byte. Monsters can be dealt with in three ways: bribing, fighting mentally and fighting physically. Bribing involve giving away one collected item. Fighting mentally involve giving the right answer to a multiplication problem where five numbers briefly flash onto the screen. In the physical fight the player and the AI take turns playing a simple action mini game. The enemy appears to the right and an arrow moves up and down to the left. The player simply has to press the fire button at the right time to hit the enemy and some hit points will then be deducted.<br><br>When starting out the player gets to choose which of ten computers to play as. Each computer has different advantages and disadvantages with the cheaper ones being weaker. There are five traits (speed, ram level, rom level, linguistic level and expansion level) that can be improved by buying extra components such as chips and cards.",
