  "description": "In Type-Rope, the player enters the role of Mistertronic, who has to rescue his friends who have been captured by a dreaded thread. To untie the captured characters the player has to remove each thread by typing in the letters and numbers that appear on each side of each thread. When all threads are gone the character is free, and the game moves on to the next. The player earns points for each thread he unties, and the quicker he is, the more points will he get. For each character there's a time limit. This gets shorter for every rescued character. ",
