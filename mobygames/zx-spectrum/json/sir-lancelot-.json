  "description": "In this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Manic+Miner\">Manic Miner</a> variant <i>Sir Lancelot</i> is exploring a castle in the hope of finding treasures. He must navigate his way through 24 platform screens (in a predefined order on the Spectrum but in any order on the Amstrad), collecting every object on each one to reveal the exit within a time limit. <br><br>There are enemies on fixed attack paths to avoid - Lancelot has no weapon but can jump, and survive any length of fall. Avoiding contact is thus a case of jumping out of their way, and using lower ledges to strategically time his moves. There are sections you can freely climb but not descend, so timing and forward planning are important. Contact with any of these costs one of your four lives, and resets the screen to its starting position.",
