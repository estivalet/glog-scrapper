  "description": "The late comic's risque TV show usually saw him dashing around frantically chasing after scantily-clad ladies half his age and half his weight. Colour-clashing bras would lack beauty, however, so the licensed game instead sees Benny attempting to carry out 3 levels of work for the community (he was a nice guy at heart). Unfortunately, his generosity is misconstrued as theft, so you'll have to flee as quickly as possible.<br><br>On level 1 he is taking laundry from the clothesline to the laundry basket, item by item, avoiding the local busybody, on level 2 he gathers apples whilst being chased by a tractor, and on level 3 he collects bric-a-brac, much to the police's panic.<br><br>The graphics are large and blocky, using a similar style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,185732/\">Don Priestley</a>'s <a id=\"dcf19db967e1bfc36eebd88a4650e9bed\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Popeye\">Popeye</a> license for DK'Tronics. The gameplay takes place on 3 depths of each side-view flick-screen, with obstacles such as lamp-posts often blocking one of those levels, requiring a quick move into the screen. Contact with these obstacles costs time, which is vital when you're being chased to your target.",
