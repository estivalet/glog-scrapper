  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Probe+Software\">Probe</a>'s <i>RoboCop 3</i> for 8-bit computers combines two different styles of gameplay: the first level is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a>-style shooting gallery, while the rest are side-scrolling platform levels. RoboCop's enemies are mostly &quot;Splatterpunks&quot; and &quot;Rehabs&quot;, while bosses include Otomo Ninjabots, a tank, and RoboCop's old &quot;friend&quot; ED-209. In the platform levels, Robo can collect weapon power-ups, which upgrade his standard weapon first to rapid fire, then to a three-way shot. Also available are a flamethrower, laser gun and a guided missile (each with only limited ammunition). In level three, RoboCop dons his jetpack to fly across the area, but must walk back the same way in level four. In all levels, he can collect repair tokens, which allow the player to repair specific areas of the cyborg's body in a repair screen between levels.",
