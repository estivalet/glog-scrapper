  "description": "<i>Flashpoint</i> is an action/strategy game that is played on two grids of 45 squares (5 lines of 9 squares each) facing each other and representing an area of the galaxy. <br><br>The game is always played against an opponent which can be either computer controlled or another player. Each side places their units (80 in total) on the grid in real time so as to get to a score of 2000 first. Points are awarded when placing an unit or destroying an enemy unit. In addition to regular units, there are 5 types of weapons that can be used to destroy enemy units. ",
