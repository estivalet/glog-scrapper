  "description": "<i>Micro Mouse Goes De-bugging</i> is an action set inside a computer program. Software bugs are trying to destroy Micro Mouse's programs and it's up to the player to help him out. In the middle of the screen there is a short Basic program with some letters missing. It's the player's job to collect these letters, which can be found in four cages at the corners of the screen, and put them back into the code. To make it easier to see which letters needs to be retrieved they are flashing in the code. At the same time the bugs run around and attempt to steal the letters and put them back into the cages. When more than a certain percentage of the letters are missing there will be a system crash and the player has to start again. To stop the bugs the player can pick up a can of datakill and shoot at the bugs. Problem is that it is not possible to both carry datakill and letters at the same time. When a bug carrying a letter is killed the letter automatically returns to the code. Once the program is complete it will run and the player can move on to the next level which has a more complex program and more attacking bugs.",
