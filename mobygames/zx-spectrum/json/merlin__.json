  "description": "Merlin the magician lost his magical powers. To reactivate his stock of skills Merlin must collect the magic stars that lie in Camelot's horizontally-scrolling passages and rooms. Bats, small ghosts and bewitched sweeping brooms occupy dark rooms and don't allow him easily cope with the task. Merlin's remaining life force is displayed by an emerging gravestone at the bottom left of the screen. If the gravestone is full, Merlin dies. In addition, many enemies are killed with a single touch, without spending a gravestone.",
