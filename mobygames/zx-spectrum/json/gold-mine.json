  "description": "You play a miner who tunnels underground to explore abnormalities which may be turn out to be gold, underground streams or various sorts of rock abnormality (which may affect the tunnels you've already dug or the route of new ones)<br><br>Each return to the pithead reduces net earnings, but if you leave it too late you may overload the lift or run out of energy. The overall aim is to find all the gold without becoming trapped underground or going bankrupt. <br><br>A version with enhanced graphics and sound was later ported to the 256K MGT SAM Coupe.",
