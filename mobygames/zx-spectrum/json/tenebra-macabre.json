  "description": "<i>Tenebra Macabre</i> is a game made in a single day for Halloween. Mega Meghan has been locked up in a dark crypt by Jurufranto Morante. The only way out is by activating magic candles in each room. The game revisits a gameplay element previously explored in some areas of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas-tales-4-severin-sewers\">Phantomas Tales #4: Severin Sewers</a> by the same developer where the entire room is dark and only a small radius around the character is visible. Fortunately there are flashes of lightning every now and then that light up the entire room briefly.<br><br>The game contains a single level that consists of several single-screen rooms combined using the flip-screen mechanic. Each room contains a single candle. Mega Meghan has to complete platforming sections while avoiding enemies as she has no means of attack. The visible radius around her is in colour, but once the candle has been found the entire room is revealed and the screen is rendered monochromatic. There are 24 candles to be found and she starts with nine lives.",
