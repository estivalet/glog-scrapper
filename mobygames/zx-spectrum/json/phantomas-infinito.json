  "description": "<i>Phantomas Infinito</i> is a fangame starring the android thief character from the 1986 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas\">Phantomas</a>. It is the first fangame by the developer and was meant to be an unofficial sequel. It would eventually lead to a large number of other games starring the character by the same developer. The story details how Phantomas returns to the planet where he came from and discovers the other androids and pieces of his past. This linear 2D game consists of a single level formed through several single-screen rooms linked horizontally. The player takes Phantomas through several rooms with platforming sections. He has to avoid enemies as he has no means of attack and can only jump.",
