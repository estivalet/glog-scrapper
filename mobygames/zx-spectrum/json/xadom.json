  "description": "<i>Xadom</i> is an action game where you have to collect weapons to battle monsters and aliens. The character needs to find a way through mazes and enter a next room through a portal near the top of the screen. There is complex story introduction involving a character whisked away to a satellite five kilometres above Earth to appear before a Local Grand Council.<br><br>The game uses single, fixed-screen levels shown from a bird's eye perspective. Rooms only last a few seconds as the character just moves on to the portal. However there are some obstacles and some rooms contain traps and aliens that need to be avoided. While some rooms are almost completely empty, others contain a weapon. Weapons can be used to strike in four directions.<br><br>The HUD shows the current room, the collected weapons, the power score and the total score. There are three difficulty levels:<ul>\n<li>20 rooms - 6 traps - 4 aliens</li>\n<li>100 rooms - 10 traps - 7 aliens</li>\n<li>200 rooms - 10 traps - 10 aliens</li></ul>The game speed can also be adjusted based on three levels. The game ends when a final teleporter is reached and then the total score is calculated.",
