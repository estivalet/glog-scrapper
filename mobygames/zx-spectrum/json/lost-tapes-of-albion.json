  "description": "<i>Lost Tapes of Albion</i> is an evolution of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/efmb-endless-forms-most-beautiful\">Endless Forms Most Beautiful</a></i>, presented to the ZX Spectrum on its 30th birthday. In this arcade platform game, you play Moebius, intergalactic collector of all sorts of rubbish, including ZX Spectrum games. Now, you find yourself in a parallel universe where the ZX Spectrum was released, but with a slightly different set of games, which you must find to gain a complete collection once more.<br><br>Each stage takes place on a screen of 8 platforms which wrap around on the screen edges, so that crossing one platform to the right makes you appear on the left side of the platform below, and vice versa. There are also teleport pads that you can use to jump up and down from platform to platform. Each platform is patrolled by one or several creatures of varying speed an intelligence, as well as randomly appearing bombs. To complete a screen, you must pick up all the little tapes spread across the platforms. At random intervals, special enemies appear, namely the fast and colourful &quot;attribute worm&quot; that zig-zags across the platforms, and gargantuan enemies that can occupy nearly a quarter of the screen.<br><br>After completing a screen, you are presented with your finds, which are parody spoofs of famous Speccy games such as <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hungry-horace\">Hungry Horace</a></i> or <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cassette-50\">Cassette 50</a></i>.<br><br>The simple but thorough arcade gameplay of <i>Lost Tapes</i> has since inspired conversions to other platforms, such as the SAM Coupé's <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lost-disks-of-sam\">The Lost Disks of SAM</a></i> or <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/incredible-adventures-of-moebius-goatlizard\">Moebius Goatlizard</a></i> for the Amiga.",
