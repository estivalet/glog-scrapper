Smith</a>'s World War II trilogy, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arnhem-the-market-garden-operation\">Arnhem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/desert-rats-the-north-africa-campaign\">Desert Rats</a>. It simulates the Tunisian Campaign in 1942-43 from the arrival of the 'Torch' Task Force and their race for Tunis, to the final battle of 'Operation Vulcan'. There are 5 armies (3 Allied &amp; 2 Axis) and 5 scenarios, including the battles of Kasserine and Mareth. Each scenario has several pre-conditions to start from, which include Axis control Malta, Axis capture Bone, DAK (Deutsches Afrika Korps) destroyed, Desert armies late, and French neutrality.<br><br>The gameplay is flown on scrolling map by turns.
