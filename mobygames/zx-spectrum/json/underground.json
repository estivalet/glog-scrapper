  "description": "“Underground” is a platform game which style slightly reminds to Dinamic's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/abu-simbel-profanation\">Abu Simbel Profanation</a>. The objective of our protagonist is to gather eight objects distributed by the extensive mapping of the game, in a correct and logical order, otherwise they will tansform into deadly weapons if you touch them when you shouldn't. Unlike in other programs of its kind there's not an only way to cross, there are many and it's up to your intuition, which in most of cases will not give with the correct way. There are three kinds of enemies, who together with the traps and the obstacles distributed by all the structure will increase the difficulty and also the addiction.",
