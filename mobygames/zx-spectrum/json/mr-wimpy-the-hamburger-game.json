  "description": "<i>Mr. Wimpy</i> is a one-player game, where the character controls Mr. Wimpy whose favorite hobby is making tasty hamburgers. In level one, you are required to bring back each ingredient (cheese, beef patty, and sausage) separately on each of the three trays provided.  The player must avoid the 'moving manholes' which will take away the tray or ingredient that they are carrying. <br><br>Once you have done this, you'll advance a level where the gameplay changes a la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Burger+Time\">Burger Time</a>. The object is to make four burgers, and you do this by running over ingredients including either cheese or lettuce, beef patties, and the two hamburger buns, to make them fall onto the level below you without coming in contact with evil onions, hot dogs, and egg yolks. If you are unfortunate enough to come in contact with these nasties, you'll lose one of your five lives, unless you sprinkle pepper on them. Note that you only have a limited supply of pepper, so to get more, you need to travel to the top level and get cups of coffee or sundaes that move around the screen. Another way to deal with these enemies is to wait until one of them gets under an ingredient, and squash them by running over the ingredient. They will get squashed only to get resurrected somewhere on the screen.<br><br>When the ingredients are at the bottom level and you run over them, they will drop onto one of the four burgers at the bottom of the screen. When you make all four burgers, you proceed to the next level. The more levels you proceed, the more difficult your quest is.",
