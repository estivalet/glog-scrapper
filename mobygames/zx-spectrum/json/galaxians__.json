The player's goal is to destroy a matrix of enemy spaceships which is gradually descending the screen. Single ships will sometimes leave the formation and bombard the player with multiple shots.<br><br>There's only a single scenario with a single type of spaceship. The process repeats itself when a squadron is completely eliminated, but the difficulty increases.",
