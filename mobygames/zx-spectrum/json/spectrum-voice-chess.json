  "description": "<i>Spectrum Voice Chess</i> is a chess game using the Spectrum's sound hardware to say the moves after they have been made. Comments such as 'check', 'well I never' and 'oh well' will also be interjected by the computer player when appropriate. There are seven skill levels, with all but the easiest of these offering a move suggestion feature. The ability to edit the board layout is provided, even during a game. Current positions can be printed or displayed to the screen.",
