  "description": "Buyers of the February 1992 issue of Your Sinclair magazines received this cassette free with it, the star attraction arguably being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a>, converting the original top-down close-quarters racing game. The other free commercial game is the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Hewson\">Hewson</a> shoot 'em up <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3d-lunattack\">3D Lunattack</a>. <br><br>Demo versions of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/double-dragon-3-the-rosetta-stone\">Double Dragon 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Hi-Tec\">Hi-Tec</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Wile+Road\">Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote</a> license, and the wargame <moby game=\"Avalanche\">Avalanche, and a package of Poke cheats, are also featured.<br><br>There's also an exclusive game called Space 7. You drive an AV8 android with the aim of locating the Space 7 Control Computer. The android has no weapons, so the enemies must be avoided - as much high-speed contact with the many trees and obstacles. The droid has two modes - in Autocar mode movement is faster, but you must be in the slower Android mode to use objects.",
