  "description": "These six small educational games star Freddy the Frog. Each uses simple controls to ensure that children can play without difficulty from the software.<br><br>Using forward, back, left and right keys Freddy must get to various important buildings as depicted on the screen. In Adding he is presented with a network of lily pads, some of which contain numbers or mathematical symbols. Land on these in the correct order to produce a correct sum. In the Toyshop, first identify toys from their names, then choose a toy at a specified price, and then combine goods to meet a specified price limit.<br><br>Electricity allows you to learn about circuits - by working out whether an existing layout will work, and modifying it so that it will. The next game involves telling the time, so as to get the prince his key. Funtext teaches information searching using a Ceefax-type environment.",
