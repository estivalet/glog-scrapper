  "description": "<i>Phantomasa in the Land of the Grunge Wizards</i> is the sequel to the 1993 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Phantomasa\">Phantomasa</a> with the original developer still involved. This version of the game was made for the Concurso Libre de Videojuegos 2006 competition which it won. In this 2D platformer the protagonist is once again the female android. This time she needs to steal 25 sacks of gold. The game consists of a single large level made up out of several single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically through a flip-screen mechanic offering some room for exploration.<br><br>The android can move around and jump. Enemies cannot be attacked, they can only be avoided. There are a lot of platforming sections that require careful timing. The android starts with 50 health and this is drained when in contact with an enemy of a hazard. With each sack of gold some additional health is provided.",
