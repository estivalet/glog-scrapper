  "description": "<i>Double Agent</i> is a single player, text adventure. <br><br>Given the title one would expect a story about spies, treachery and such but this is not the case. This is a sci-fi story set in the future on the planet Marego. It's rebels are trying to take control of the planet and the crystal they are using as their power source is polluting the planet. The player controls an exploration party which is almost wiped out by these rebels as they landed. There are two survivors, one tough but with limited knowledge, the other weaker but learned.<br>\nDue to the nature of the attack neither can think for themselves so the player has to guide both characters through the game so that they return with both the crystal and samples for analysis. The game features a split screen which allows the player to 'see' both agents at the same time, entering 1 or 2 switches control from one to the other.<br><br>A free game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Escape\">Escape</a>, also from <i>Tartan Software</i> was included on the 'B' side of the cassette tape.\n",
