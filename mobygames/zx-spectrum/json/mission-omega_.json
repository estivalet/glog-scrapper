  "description": "<i>Mission Omega</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Blitz\">Blitz</a> variant. That means the player is in control of a bomber plane and has to destroy the entirety of a city. The plane automatically moves from the left to the right and gets gradually closer to the buildings. To be able to land all building have to be destroyed or else a crash will occur. This version of the game is not exclusively about bombing since the plane also can shoot missiles. This is necessary to destroy the meteors and enemy aircrafts that move around above the city. The difficulty can be set from 0 to 9 in three different categories. Alpha decides the height of the buildings, beta decides the number of meteors and gamma decides the number of enemy planes.",
