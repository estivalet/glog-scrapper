  "description": "<i>Four Minutes to Midnight</i> is a post-apocalyptic text adventure with a twist. The game takes place in the United States in the not so distant future and the premise is that there has been an outbreak of a deadly bacteria strain. The twist is that the player can in a true RPG fashion, gather a party of adventurers in an otherwise classic text adventure to help along with the quest at hand. Different members can have different skills that help with the problems the player encounters. The objective is to lead your party of five survivors across the devastated United States to sanctuary.",
