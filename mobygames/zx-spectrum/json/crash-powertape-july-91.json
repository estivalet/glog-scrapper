  "description": "The main free cassette with the July 1991 issue of Spectrum magazine Crash! came with a block of POKE cheats, as ever, as well as a demo of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/turrican-ii-the-final-fight\">Turrican</a>. There are also four complete games to play though. Two of the games had been released previously, and both had been successful many years earlier - Hewson's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dragontorc\">Dragontorc</a> and Design Design's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2112ad\">2112AD</a>.<br><br>The other two are exclusive to this cassette. Cricket Coach is a management game set in a fictitious one-day cricket league between the 17 English counties who annually played for the title at the time. Your players are roted on skill and energy, with a maximum squad size of 15 and occasional new players brought in to fill gaps. A balanced team of 11 with batsmen, bowlers and a wicket-keeper must be chosen, with your team's innings then unfolding before your eyes, and a score for your opposition generated to get a result.<br><br>In Interactive Fiction title Moon Magic 2, the spaceship is under the control of a Silicon-based Prototype Oxygen Numerising Genetic Entity, or SPONGE for short. Controlling Sponge, you are in a mess, as some money and treasure has been misplaced, and you only have a limited amount of time to find it.",
