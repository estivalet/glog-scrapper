  "description": "<i>splATTR</i> is a shooting game where the player controls a crosshair over a playfield that can scroll in all directions. The premise of the game is very simple. Each level of the game has two different kinds of objects that move around the playfield. What the player has to do is simply to destroy some objects while avoiding others. To do so the player drops bombs which don't hit they target instantly so the player has to aim in front of the moving object to be able to hit. The bad objects have to be avoided as they will drain the player's energy when the crosshair is kept over it. The game has 32 levels with different objects in each. The initial level has coins and bricks, another has snow flakes and presents and further ones have, taps and toilets, birds and many other things. There are also some levels that are constructed as mazes where energy is drained when touching the walls. ",
