  "description": "In terms of both interface and setting, this license was atypical of adventures at the time. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,444213/\">Enid Blyton</a>'s <i>Famous Five</i> books told of jolly adventures on mysterious treasure islands played out by a group of well-mannered inquisitive youngsters. The story takes in Aunt Fanny's cottage, a fishing boat, a forest and a courtyard among other locations.<br><br>This is brought to life as an interactive fiction game, using a purely keyboard-driven interface. Descriptions are written in Blytonesque language. You can control any of the four human characters at any time, and must often swap between them. You can EXAMine and TAKE objects, TALK to people and even attack each other.",
