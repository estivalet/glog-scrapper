  "description": "<i>Man Hunt</i> is an arcade game for the Spectrum where the objective is to survive long enough to accumulate a high score.<br><br>The story behind the game is that the player's character is exploring on a distant world, collecting dilithium crystals, when they encounter an area containing both acid pools and crystals. At this point they are surprised by a number of aliens who move in a direct line towards them. The only way the character can survive is to move in such a way that an acid pool is directly between themselves and the alien because the alien will then walk into the acid pool and perish.<br><br>Points are scored for aliens who perish, either in acid pools or by colliding, and crystals collected.<br><br>The game starts with four aliens and fifteen acid pools. When these four aliens are destroyed, five more take their place. \nThe number of acid pools decreases as the game progresses until at level 8 there is only one pool left.<br><br>The player has only one life per game and there is no save game feature.<br><br>",
