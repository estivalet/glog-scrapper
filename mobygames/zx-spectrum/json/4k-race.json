  "description": "<i>4K Race</i> is a left-to-right 2D vanishing perspective racing game whereby you must avoid contact with computer opponents and the edge of the track whilst reaching 7 checkpoints before the timer runs down. You start with 60 secs to reach the 2nd checkpoint but only 45 secs for each subsequent checkpoint. The title of the game is based on it being just 4Kb in size, although it will only run properly on 128k machines. The game was an entry to the 2004 FFD2 Minigame Compo. ",
