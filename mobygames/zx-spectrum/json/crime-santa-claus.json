  "description": "In this game, the player takes a role of Santa Claus to help him recover his staff, because without it he wouldn't be able to enter people's homes to bring them joy and or happiness... or something else. <i>Crime Santa Claus</i> is a two-dimensional arcade adventure, modeled after the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=dizzy-series\">Dizzy series</a>. There isn't much action or platforming here, though health can be lost by performing a &quot;wrong&quot; action.<br><br>The gameplay is mostly about collecting various objects lying around the world and then using them in a right place or giving them to some character. That in turn will provide you with further instructions or with another item - just like in a typical adventure, but with a different look. <br><br>The game world is divided into many screens and the player will need to revisit them to discover the new uses for the items he collected, or to gain access to areas that were inaccessible before.<br><br>",
