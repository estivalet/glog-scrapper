  "description": "In 408 AD the Roman Empire is crumbling and the Romans have mostly left Britannia. you play Maroc the mage, a &quot;Lore Seeker&quot;, who  has set out to defeat Avelach, Lord of Chaos.\nYou control Maroc's astral projection which can cast spells to achieve various parts of the quest, the objective is to advance in sixteen ranks by exploring the world and collecting spells and ultimately destroy the Lord of Chaos.<br><br>Maroc starts outside a castle where a spell descends upon him and projects his astral projection inside it. The projection can only act or move through the use of spells.The two basic spells are movement and servant spells. The move spell allows the projection to move around and the servant spell summons a spirit that can move about and collect objects or other spells for Maroc. \nOnly up to four objects can be carried around at a time and there are around 220 locations on eight levels.\nEnemies will attack the projection and drain it's energy which can be replenished with a spell, if depleted the projection is destroyed and the game reverts to Maroc outside the castle, ready for another go.",
