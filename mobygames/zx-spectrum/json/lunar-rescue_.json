  "description": "<i>Lunar Rescue</i> is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Taito\">Taito</a>'s arcade game of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue scientists from the surface of a moon. From a mothership at the top of the screen, the player drops down rescue pods that he has to safely land on the moon's three landing platforms. This works similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lunar+Lander\">Lunar Lander</a> but here the player has to navigate his way through an asteroid field. The player can steer left and right and use the thrust to decrease the speed. Once the player has landed successfully, a scientist will enter the pod and the player takes ofo again. Unlike the original arcade game this version doesn't feature any aliens, so the player has to make his way through the asteroid field a second time. There are six scientists to pick up but the pod only has place for one at a time so the player has to do six trips to bring them all back home. After that the game starts over on higher difficulty with more asteroids. ",
