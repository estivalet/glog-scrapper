  "description": "<i>Maze Mania</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac+Man\">Pac Man</a> variant. Flippo, the protagonist, has to solve a number of mazes by turning all tiles into a certain colour. He has to walk over them to turn them, but some of them turn every time he walks over them and other ones only turn when approached from a certain direction. Of course there are also enemies which try to hinder Flippo's progress: every contact with them lowers his energy and when it reaches zero, a life is lost. Spread over the levels are power ups which either give an extra life, extra energy or allow Flippo to kill his enemies at contact for a limited amount of time. Flippo can jump over enemies and holes.",
