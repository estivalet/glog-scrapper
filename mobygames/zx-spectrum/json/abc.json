  "description": "<i>ABC</i> is an educational game that aims to teach primary school children (5-8 years old) spelling. The game starts with asking the playing to press a key. An object beginning at that letter is then drawn on the screen along with a caption of what the picture depicts. After a few seconds the caption will disappear, and the player's task now is to spell the word right. If correct the player will be rewarded with flashing colors and a happy little tune.",
