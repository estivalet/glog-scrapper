The cassette inlay introduction gives some good background info on the game;<br><br>&quot;On a cold grey morning in the middle of London thirty people gathered in a very ordinary office block. These people, in the age range 14 to 60, had one thing in common. They had completed one of the most difficult computer games ever devised; GYRON NECROPOLIS, and were brought together to compete in the grand final play off. Their task? Complete the GYRON ARENA game in the shortest possible time. The prize? A brand new Porsche 924 motor car or £12,500 cash. Further competitions were held in Spain and Denmark simultaneously with London to give foreign finalists the chance to claim the prize. The winner came from the Spanish heat, who finished the game in a blistering 18 minutes! Here is your opportunity to play the ARENA game used in the final ... Bet you can't beat 18 minutes!&quot;\n",
