  "description": "You are Humgruffin, a troll who has been transported to the Netherworld of Narc a land full of Goblins and crystals and ceilings to walk on. The only chance to escape is to reverse a spell that put him there. In each chamber is a crystal which needs to be collected and put in an amulet. You need to avoid the Goblins or being trapped by walls built by them. If you touch a Goblin then you start to turn to stone and transported elsewhere in Narc. To help you on your quest you can make holes appear in the ground for you to fall through into another part of Narc or make a Goblin disappear. You can use other objects as well and these include Pyramids (to jump up to the ceiling), Toadstools (summons a Dwarf to make holes in the floor) and Die (to make a random hole).<br><br><i>Troll</i> is a 3D isometric game which shows both the floor and ceiling that can be walked on. The game is viewed at an elevated angle. The joystick or keyboard can be used and as well as the main playing area you can also see the icons you need to help you on your quest.",
