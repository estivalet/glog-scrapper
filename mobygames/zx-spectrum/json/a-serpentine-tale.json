  "description": "<i>A Serpentine Tale</i> is a fantasy text adventure. In this game the player takes the role of the hero from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Zenobi+Software\">Zenobi Software's</a> earlier text adventure <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Black+Tower\">The Black Tower</a>. The tale starts with the player taking a trip to the City of Hiarken for a sort of holiday. <br><br>The bad news is that a day or so from your destination a storm sinks the ship. The good news is that you alone survive in a small boat. The bad news is that a short way into the game a giant sea serpent appears, smashes the boat and swallows you whole. <br><br>Unsurprisingly the object of the game is to survive, escape, and make your way to shore.",
