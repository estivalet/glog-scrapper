Other aliens to worry about are Hive, Dynamo, Technofighter, Firebomber and Lure.<br><br>To help you in your fight you have a long range scanner, smart bomb, energy cloak, Hive convergence indicator and hyperfate.<br><br>Guardian II is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Defender\">Defender</a> style 1 or 2 player horizontally sidewards scrolling shoot-em-up where you can go left or right.
