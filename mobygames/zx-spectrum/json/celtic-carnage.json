  "description": "<i>Celtic Carnage</i> is the fourth text adventure centred on the forces of the Primal Darkness led by &quot;The Abomination&quot; and their war with &quot;Time Crusaders of Chronos&quot;.<br><br>The previous three games saw first a village in Ireland, then a Caribbean island, and then the Aztec empire threatened. The game is set in Ulster, Ireland. It is 12 BC, the time of the Celts. The game is based around the ancient Irish folk tale of ' 'Táin Bó Cúailnge'.<br><br>In this tale Ulster was defended by the great warrior Setana (aka Cuchulainn). The neighbouring Queen Medb of Connacht famously crossed the border and invaded Ulster to steal a prized bull. Mighty Ulster was defenceless partly because her great hero was missing and partly because the knights in Ulster's army were afflicted by a terrible sickness.<br><br>In the game's reworking of the tale Queen Medb's goal is not only to steal the wonderful bull but to slaughter every warrior in Ulster. In this she is aided by the Formorians, destructive beings from Irish folklore who come from the Primal Darkness.<br><br>As the Phoenix / Traveller In Black your tasks are to cure the sickness afflicting Ulster's warriors, stop Queen Mebd and her army, and find Cuchulainn the hero of Ulster.",
