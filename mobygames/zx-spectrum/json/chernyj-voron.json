  "description": "<i>Chernyj Voron</i> - roughly translated as Black Raven - is a real-time strategy game that tries to mimic a notable Blizzard hit as far as an 8-bit system allows.<br><br>The game starts with a twelve minute long intro that takes up an entire floppy-disk. The intro features short pre-rendered 3D animations that were created in 3DS Max or a similar program and then converted to Z Spectrum.<br><br>The gameplay is very close to <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=warcraft\">Warcraft</a></i> - it's classical strategy game where the player needs to build and expand the base, gather  resources, recruit soldiers, wage battles and fulfill different missions objectives. <br><br>There are two types of resources: wood and gold, collected from their respective sources on the game map. Units can be selected and grouped together, &amp; the combat is also in real-time, with many different characters and magical spells. The game also displays the fog of war - &amp; there's a map and a save feature.<br><br><i>Chernyj Voron</i> uses a black and white monochrome mode with color interface bar that allows for smaller and more accurate sprites.",
