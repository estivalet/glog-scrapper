  "description": "In this top-view shooter with similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>, <i>Mr. Weems</i> has set out to kill the <i>She Vampires</i> in their mansion, which is split into six levels. These include many locked doors for which keys must be found, plus teleporters and secret paths.<br><br>Weems' main foes are bats and monsters, strategically placed inside coffins, and regenerating when you re-enter a room. Contact with these drains his blood, although fortunately there are replacement vials of this to be found. He is armed with a garlic-firing gun, plus limited numbers of garlic pills, which make enemies avoid him. <br><br>The first five levels feature the objects required to kill the She Vampires — a crucifix, large garlic piece, stake, mirror and mallet. Once they are killed, he must make his escape, facing all those bats and monsters again.",
