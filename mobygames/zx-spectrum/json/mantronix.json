  "description": "<i>Mantronix</i> is an arcade game where the player controls a small robot and must use it to explore an alien world, kill guards, and collect treasures.<br><br>The player takes the role of a recently promoted bounty hunter of the Planetary Law Federation. They embark on a mission to the planet Zybor where four dangerous criminals are hiding. All previous attempts to deal with these desperadoes have failed. \nThe planet is inhabited by a race of humanoids who have been programmed to protect these criminals, and it is littered with valuable items. The Galaxy Police issue a termination order for the first of the evil miscreants and stage is therefore set for a lot of killing and scavenging.<br><br>Naturally this is dangerous work so rather than explore and fight in person, the player controls a robot, the Mantronix, who does all the real work.<br><br>In addition to fulfilling your mission of killing the guards to get to the bad guys and scavenging as much as possible, the player must find eight power cubes and reverse the direction of a series of conveyor belts in order to acquire fuel for the journey home. <br><br>",
