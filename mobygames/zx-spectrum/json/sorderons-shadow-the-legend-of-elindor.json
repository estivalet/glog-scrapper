  "description": "<i>Sorderon's Shadow</i> is a mixture of a classic text adventure game, an action game and a role playing game. You as the un-named one shall unite the living and bring about Sorderon's downfall by completing nine separate tasks in order.<br>\n \nIn the strange land of Elindor, the evil Caradach the Watcher sent his lieutenant Manic Treeblower to the north to raise rebellion. The sorceror Sorderon was sent to take over the throne of the good king Ba. In succeeding so, he stole the fabled scroll of Dorian which gives the gift of immortality.\nHaving learnt the secrets of the scroll he returned to Caradach, slaying him, declaring himself the master of Elindor. The remaining living of Elindor await the coming of the un-named one that shall set them free.<br><br>",
