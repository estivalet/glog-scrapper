  "description": "&quot;Emilio Butragueño 2&quot; is the sequel to the award-winning <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Emilio+Butrague%c3%b1o+F%c3%batbol\">Emilio Butragueño Fútbol</a>. This game consists of two parts, which are in fact two games previously released in England under a license from English player Gary Lineker- <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gary+Lineker+Super+Skills\">Gary Lineker's Super Skills</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gary+Lineker+Hot+Shot\">Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot</a>. <br><br>On the first one, we will practice the basic skills which could be helpful for our aspirations, so in order to improve them we will have to chose difficulty level and then train flexions, displacements (with cones, flags...), ball juggling, dribbling, penalty shots, etc.<br><br>And finally, on the second part (load), we will try to win the World Cup, for that, we will choose game length, control method and our team, then, we will be playing in one of the four (rather Euro-centric in composition) groups composed by Brazil, Argentina, England, Scotland, Wales, Ulster, Ireland, France, Germany, Holland, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Poland, USSR and Uruguay.",
