  "description": "Shortly after Football Manager became a sensation, the sports management concept was applied to the high-pressure dollar-intensive world of Formula 1 racing. The top six teams of the early 80s are featured (Ferrari, Williams, Renault and McLaren as well as the now-defunct Brabham and Lotus), and you can choose which one to manage. Your first tasks are to choose your two sponsors and two drivers, with all the day's top names as well as 6 'rookie' drivers, who are cheap, but there's no guarantee of getting a good one.<br><br>Once the game is properly underway, you must buy engine and chassis upgrades, and can improve the quality of your pitcrew - all of which eats into your budget. Your cars must be raceworthy to be able to race. After qualifying you must choose your tyres for each car - rain can be a factor, and the game informs you of the expected conditions before the race.<br><br>The races are depicted via a timing board which displays the top 6 in the order, images of the cars flashing by (with a distinction made as cars come into the pits), and messages detailing crashes, spins and technical problems. Your drivers can be called in for pitstops, which involves moving a man around to undo each tyre in sequence, which is hardly realistic but does add some arcade skill and variation.",
