  "description": "<i>Castles and Clowns</i> is an educational title that can be played by one or two players<br><br>When the game starts the player(s) choose whether to play the Castles game or the Clowns game. Both Games are based on picture/letter recognition and in both game modes the player(s) select a game speed which effectively sets the game difficulty<br><br>In the King of the Castle game the player sees a representation of a castle with ten windows. The game generates a random number in the range 0-9 where each digit corresponds to a window. The player's task is to identify the appropriate picture and press the key which corresponds to it's initial letter; 'd' for dog, 't' for television and so-on.<br>When all picture questions have been asked the player is shown their score and is asked if they want to play again.<br><br>In the Clowns game the clown stands in the centre of the screen holding a book. He has a letter on his hat. The pages of the book flip open to reveal pictures and the player hits the RETURN key when the initial letter of the thing in the picture matches the letter in the clown's hat. Scores are shown by balloons on either side of the clown, the first to win six balloons wins the game, in a single player game the player's balloons are on one side and balloons are added to the other side for each wrong answer. When a game is over the clown slowly floats upwards and disappears from the screen only to reappear to ask the player if they want to play again.",
