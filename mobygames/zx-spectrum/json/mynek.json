  "description": "<i>M?ynek</i> (Mill) is an action game, taking place on a board made up of several concentric square lanes filled with dots. <br><br>The player's character (a mill) is moving ceaselessly along the lanes, picking up the dots on the way; the goal on each level is to collect all the dots. Lanes can only be changed by moving left/right/up/down while near a gap. A hostile purple square is roaming the maze randomly as well, and colliding with it causes the player to lose a life. A slowdown key makes the mill move slowly while it's pressed down.",
