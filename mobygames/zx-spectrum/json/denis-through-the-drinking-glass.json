  "shortName": "denis-through-the-drinking-glass",
  "description": "Margaret Thatcher's late husband Denis was known to like a drop of gin, a fact frequently exploited by satirical magazine Private Eye. As such, this text adventure stars you as Denis, on his quest to escape Number 10 Downing Street (and Maggie) to get to the Gravedigger's Arms pub.<br><br>Denis must get a drink within 10 moves, or else it is game over. The location descriptions are written in an unusual style, set to rhyme and featuring wry observations about the drudgery of political life from Denis' unique position. Similarly, the Help feature often gives terse, sarcastic and less-than-helpful responses.<br><br>As you progress through the game, mock headlines from The Sun newspaper appear to comment on your situations. The game is written in Quill, a popular adventure creation package from Gilsoft themselves.",
