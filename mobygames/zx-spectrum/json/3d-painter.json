  "description": "<i>3D Painter</i> is a maze game similar to the arcades respectively either aesthetically or gameplay-wise to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/make-trax\">Make Trax</a> (Alpha Denshi, 1981) and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/pac-man\">Pac-Man</a> (Namco, 1981). <br><br>The player has to course the entire maze just like Pac-Man has to &quot;eat&quot; every dot present on the screen. The same principle is also applied in <i>Make Trax</i> where the player has to &quot;paint&quot; the entire path of the maze, except in <i>3D Painter</i> the player is not represented as a paintbrush but as the painter himself. Only then he can advance to the next stage. There are 4 different possible mazes and each time their whole set is completed the speed of the game will increasingly rise up.<br><br>Besides the player, a dangerous berserker is also present on every maze. A single contact with him and the game is over.\n",
