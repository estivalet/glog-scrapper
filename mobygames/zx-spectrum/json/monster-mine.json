  "description": "<i>Monster Mine</i> is a maze game viewed from above with the whole maze on the screen and you have to move about the maze collecting gold nuggets. You start at the the bottom of the mine and you need to reach one of the exits at the top of the mine. The maze is the Eldorado Gold Mine full of the nuggets but there are monsters moving about the mine that need avoiding. Each row of the mine has a monster moving along it and if you enter one of the rows then the monster will head towards you at a faster speed. If you touch a monster it is game over and each mine has a different layout every time you play.",
