  "description": "The Planets is an exploration-based sci-fi game combining the genres of simulation and puzzle-solving. It's made up of two separate parts which complement each other during gameplay.<br><br>The first is the main game and takes place aboard a mother ship which can travel between the planets of the Solar System; monitoring the flight of a surface spaceship on a planet's atmosphere; and commanding an exploring robot on some locations of a planet where a puzzle has to be deciphered. The second is a puzzle-solving game with different levels of difficulty.",
