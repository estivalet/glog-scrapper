  "description": "<i><b>Gobble A Ghost</b></i> is a clone of the classic arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">'Pac-Man'</a>.\nThe player moves around a maze gobbling up dots. Living in the maze are four ghosts who try to stop the player gobbling all the dots. Being caught by the ghosties costs a life. \nIn the maze are four special dots called 'power pills'. for a short period of time after eating a power pill the player can gobble not on dots but can gain extra points by gobbling the ghosts as well. During this period the ghosts all turn blue, any chomped ghosts re-appear in the centre of the maze.<br><br>There are only four action keys in this game ; up, down (1 / Q) &amp; left and right (9 / 0). Once the Gobbler starts moving, he'll keep moving so quick fingers are needed to turn corners in the maze when being pursued. It is possible for both player and ghosts to go off-screen at the centre and re-appear on the other side<br><br>The objective is to keep playing for a high score. The centre of the maze displays the score for the current game and the highest score of the session.",
