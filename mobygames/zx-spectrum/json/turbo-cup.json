  "description": "Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer René Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, <i>Turbo Cup</i> is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. <br><br>After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.",
