  "description": "The Tom Cruise film featured an F-14 Tomcat plane, and this licensed game recreates this. Viewed from the cockpit in full 3D, the game is a straight head-to-head duel, against another player or the computer. You are armed with missiles (while put you in control of a small target zone, which must remain over your opponent for 3 seconds), flares and cannons (which overheat when overused)- use these more wisely than your opponent. Pay attention to speed and altitude too. The computer has 3 planes to throw at you, of which the last is the toughest, while each player in a 2-player game also has 3 'lives'.",
