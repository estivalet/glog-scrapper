  "description": "<i>Video Card Arcade</i> allows you to play three different card games in arcade form to win as much money as you can with a certain amount of credits. The three games are Poker Royal, Twenty One and High Low. <br><br>Poker Royal: Based on Five Card Poker, you are dealt five cards and you must decide which cards to hold and which cards to dispose off, trying to get the best hand. For example, if you dispose two cards then you get two new ones. You then see if you have won any money based on what hands you now have. <br><br>Twenty One: Based on the game Pontoon you play against the dealer trying to get a higher hand without going over 21. You and the dealer are dealt two cards and you can decide whether to keep them or to receive another card. You can keep receiving until you are happy with your score and then it's the dealer's turn. The winner is the player with the highest score, if you have higher than 21 then you are bust and lose.<br><br>High Low: You are dealt five cards and you can only see the first one. Here you can decide whether to keep or change it. Now you have to decide if the next card is higher or lower. If you guess correct it's onto the next card, guess wrong then you have to start with five new cards. If the next card is the same then it is determined by what suit it is. When you manage to get all five cards turned over, your winnings are based on what hands you have.",
