  "description": "<i>Muncher!</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac+Man\">Pac Man</a> variant. The main change here is that the booth in the center contains bonus fruit, instead of launching the ghosts, and also a key must be picked up in order to open it and grab the fruit inside. As always, the player must avoid the ghosts and collect the dots, with power-pills available so as to make the ghosts edible, for bonus points and to buy some time.",
