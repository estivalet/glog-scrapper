  "description": "<i>Cruising</i> is one of the simplest computer games possible, and one which probably has been independently invented more than one time. The concept is similar to games such as <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cuthbert-goes-walkabout\">Cuthbert Goes Walkabout</a></i>, in that your goal is to colour all lines on the screen while avoiding the nasties that might get in your way.<br><br>Unlike the aforementioned game, though, <i>Cruising</i> doesn't simply divide the screen into a grid. Instead, the lines make more intricate patterns, more so for each &quot;grid&quot; that you clear. Another feature is that you can make a cut in the grid so that the &quot;chaser&quot; can't follow you that way. Just make sure not to cut off your own escape route!",
