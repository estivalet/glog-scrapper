  "description": "Starting in January 1920, become a mob leader and dominate Spectral City. You must earn your money from casinos, brothels, distilleries and speakeasies, buying the number you feel will be most profitable. Recruit gang members and decide what percentage of their effort is on protecting you, rather than your assets – if either is under-protected, one of the rival gangs could take it. <br><br>Bribes must be offered to police officers to keep them sweet – too low a number and they will still raid one of your establishments. Alternatively you can tip them off about the activities of a rival, but beware of repercussions. To take power from other gangs, you can either attempt to assassinate them, or launch raids on their buildings –ideally uncovering their secret arms cache. Again, expect revenge attacks. <br><br>The game is played in turns lasting a month of game time, after which you are updated on your rivals’ finances and any new acquisitions of theirs.",
