  "description": "The smartly-dressed and graceful world of Show Jumping is recreated here, with support for up to 8 human players. There are six courses of increasing difficulty. Before taking to the course you get a plan-view of the course, with the hazards lettered to indicate the order in which they must be taken.<br><br>There is a 100-second time limit on each course, with 20 penalty points resulting in disqualification. Hitting a hazard triggers a four-point penalty, while the horse refusing a jump leads to a three-point penalty - three of those means automatic disqualification. The action is side-viewed, with the horse rotated 30 degrees by pushing left or right, with timing the jumps crucial.",
