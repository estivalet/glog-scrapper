  "description": "The planet Anfractuos is about to reach the end of its life, due to its sun evolving into a Supernova. All that remains is a mining droid under your control, which is stocked with resources and ideally needs to escape. Viewed from the side with flick-screen scrolling, the game features many one-way paths and dead-ends, so mapping is recommended (the game tells you not to blame the main programmer for this, as he didn't design the levels)<br><br>The area's wildlife is hostile to you, but it's protected, so shoot the bare minimum in your attempts to avoid it. 8 fuel crystals (located randomly in each game) must be collected before you can activate the 4 switches which activate the escape shuttle's automated departure sequence (and then return to the shuttle in time).",
