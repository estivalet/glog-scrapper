  "description": "This <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a>-inspired racing game uses a forced perspective viewpoint, with 4 small stock cars duking it out for anything between 1 and 99 laps. If you have an Interface II joystick adaptor, all 4 of these can be human controlled. <br><br>The control method is unusual, in that the accelerator and the throttle are controlled in combination - releasing the throttle while at the current gear's highest speed will move you up to the next one of the 8 gears. The brake turns into reverse when you reach zero velocity.<br><br>The game has 24 circuits, and points are awarded 7-4-2-1 for each of these, with the championship going to the driver with the most points by the end. Before each race there is a 3-minute qualifying session, in which you lap continuously with the aim of getting the fastest lap.",
