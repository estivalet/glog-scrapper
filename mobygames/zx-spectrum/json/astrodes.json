  "description": "<i>Astéroïdes</i> is a single screen action game where the player has to move a space craft (which looks very much like a TIE Fighter) from the left edge of the screen to an exit on the right. Asteroids are bouncing around the screen and these have to be avoided since any contact with them will lead to a lost life. A life is also lost when moving into any of the walls. At first there is only one asteroid but more appear as progress is made through the game. There are five difficulty levels. The second one adds a moving exit and the third one adds obstacles that have to be avoided just like the walls. On the fourth level the obstacles are moving up and down. ",
