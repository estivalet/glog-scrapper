  "description": "As Sinbad the pirate, you have not been successful recently, and there is mutiny brewing among your crew. The only way to appease them is to find your father’s buried treasure, hidden underground on Corinthia. Trogs and Soldier Ants heavily guard the island, but you have your trusty sword to help. Make sure your food and water levels stay high enough by regularly checking your status.<br><br>Viewed from a first-person view, Sinbad must navigate the building in single steps, moving in the current direction or rotating each time. Each of the 54 rooms has a pattern on its door giving some idea of its function. Some are empty, but many contain either objects or hazards (though there is no clue as to whether it is an object or a hazard). Objects include a Compass, a Bag of Gold Coins, a Treasure Chest, and the Magic Lamp, and are automatically collected. The hazards are either a magnet (damaging your compass), Trogs (who are defeated by checking the letter on its shield and pressing the appropriate letter key to jab him with the sword). Soldier Ants are scared into submission (using your torch) in the same way, but they will still lurk menacingly. The third type of room is a Clue Room, which requires the Magic Lamp, and sees you gain a hint from the Wizard.<br><br>There are six skill levels – not only do they increase the number of Trogs and Ants, they also change the letter you must press to defeat them. The position in the alphabet of the killing key is the value of the letter displayed, plus the skill level (so if you see H on level 3, press K, for example.\n",
