  "description": "Blind Alley depicts a sport set nearly a millennium from now, in which you are in control of a spacecraft and must defeat opposing craft. Gameplay resembles the Tron Light Cycles game, being played out on a grid, with more and more ships as the game progresses. Each craft has its own motion trail, which remains on the screen throughout the game, and a round is lost by a ship which hits one of these trails or the screen border. Control is directional rather than rotational, so attempting to reverse is fatal. This version has no 2-player mode, but supports Kempston joysticks and runs within 16K of memory.",
