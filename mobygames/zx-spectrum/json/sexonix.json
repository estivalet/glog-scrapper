  "description": "<i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xonix\">XoniX</a></i> games are generally a spin off from Taito's <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=QIX+Variants\">Qix</a></i>, in which the player traces outlines on a flat playfield, avoiding being touched by enemies while vulnerable tracing, and tries to close off complete rectangular portions of the screen.  Early versions would &quot;fill in&quot; completely-traced areas with geometric patterns, but sooner or later some cloner would hit on the notion that there are some background images players would find even more pleasant -- here, as you might have guessed by the game's name, what the player gradually reveals are images of attractive women in compromising positions.",
