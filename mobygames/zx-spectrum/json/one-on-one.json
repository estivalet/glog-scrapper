The user can select to play either to a certain score or for a certain amount of time.  When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks.  When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot.  Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay.  You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.",
