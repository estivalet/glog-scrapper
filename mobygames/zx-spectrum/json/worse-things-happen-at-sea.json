  "description": "Taking control of a robot ship captain, your task is to ensure that the ship travels successfully from port to port. Sadly the ship isn't particularly well-sealed, and soon starts letting water in. Every time one of these leaks appears, it is your job to get to the appropriate deck (there are 11 in total) and seal it.<br><br>Completing this task each time involves using the hatches to access the room, picking up a sealing patch, and then using it to plug the leak, before draining any water which did get in from the area. Robots and water don't mix, so you'll only be able to withstand any water for a short amount of time.",
