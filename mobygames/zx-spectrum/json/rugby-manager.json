  "description": "Time to head to the north of England and manage a rugby league team. You view the game sat in your chair looking out at your office behind your desk. The joystick moves a hand and allows you to click on certain items to help you in your quest to manage a successful team. Once you are happy with your selections and actions it's onto the next match.<br><br>The match is viewed from above the pitch as a bar moves left and right. This shows the field position of the ball as well as a text box describing the action. You are also able to see the time and the score. Holding down the fire button speeds up the action.",
