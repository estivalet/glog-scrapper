  "description": "&quot;Poogaboo: La Pulga 2&quot; is the sequel to Indescomp's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bugaboo-the-flea\">Bugaboo (The Flea)</a>. Conserving the same gaming style and argument of his predecessor, now, you will find a lot of enemies: flies, spiders, flying dragons..., etc etc; the dragon only can be avoided, but the flies can be eaten and as a result, your time to abandon the cave will be increased. The caves are filled of randomly placed rocks and you can jump to left, right or up to jump on them and manage to find the exit.\n",
