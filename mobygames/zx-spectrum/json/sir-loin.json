  "description": "Your role is to please the king for a day. You do that by sending members of the court with the right item at the right time into the throne room. You get a list of people and items and compete against the clock to locate the servants and swap items between them according to the kings whim.\nWhile wandering throughout the castle you occasionally come across opponents that you can stab with your sword to hinder them from reducing the time you have left to finish the tasks. Fail at the task at hand and the king will have you executed at dawn.",
