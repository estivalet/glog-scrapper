  "description": "<i>After rescuing the wizard Gimbal, the Magic Knight finds himself transported into the 25th century aboard the peaceful trade starship USS Pisces. He must find a way back to his own time.</i><br><br><b>Knight Tyme</b> is the third game of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/mastertronic-magic-knight-series\">Magic Knight</a> series. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Spellbound\">Spellbound</a>, the previous game, the player interacts with the environment through the &quot;Windimation&quot; system: pressing a button brings up a window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.",
