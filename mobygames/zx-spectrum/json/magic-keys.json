The player is controlling a man who has to clear out rooms filled with enemies. The man can move in four directions and shoot in eight directions. Enemies can likewise shoot in four directions. Both enemies and the player character die from one bullet; the player character also dies if he touches a wall or a closed door. Passing through a doorway takes the player to another, randomly-generated room. <br><br>The goal is to collect three keys; a part of a key appears in the room when the player kills all enemies. ",
