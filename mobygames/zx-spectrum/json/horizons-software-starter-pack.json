  "description": "This tape is a compilation of programs attributed with a didactic tone meant to enrich the knowledge and to give important tools to the ZX Spectrum and Timex user or programmer. Side A concerns tutorials (computing lessons) and a BASIC programming language glossary; Side B concerns several simulations, algorithms, utilities and &quot;Thro' the Wall&quot; the only game present and programmed in BASIC, all bundled in a single tape when buying new computers from both series.<br><br>&quot;Thro' the Wall&quot; is an adaptation for ZX Spectrum and Timex, from the original arcade &quot;Breakout&quot; (Atari, Inc.,1976), the predecessor of the arcade game &quot;Arkanoid&quot; (Taito,1986), being both ZX Spectrum and Timex versions exclusively published within this compilation. \nThe main goal is basically the same as the original: there's a wall of &quot;bricks&quot; in the upper corner of the screen and the player commands a mobile platform. Between the wall and the platform there is a powerful ball moved by the force of the &quot;gravity&quot; and the ricochet effects of what it touches. To loose is to let the ball down the lower side of the screen like in a pinball game; to win is to destroy all of the bricks using the platform and the ball as in a &quot;Pong&quot; game - note that Pong was the inspirational source for Breakout. The game is programmed in BASIC language.<br><br>It's difficult to separate what is a game and what is a simulation in the list of simulations present in the tape, but &quot;Thro' the Wall&quot; stands up to the standards of what a game is without subjectivity. <br><br>Tape Listing:<br><br>Side A\n<ol>\n<li> Hardware\n<li> Lessons 1\n<li> Lessons 2\n<li> Lessons 3\n<li> Lessons 4\n<li> Dictionary - BASIC programming language\n</ol>\nSide B\n<ol>\n<li> Thro' the Wall - a Breakout clone, the Arkanoid predecessor\n<li> Bubblesort - implements the Bubble sort algorithm \n<li> Evolution - a biological evolutionary system simulation of rabbits and foxes based on Lotka–Volterra equation\n<li> Life - an implementation of British mathematician John Horton Conway's Game of Life \n<li> Draw - a simple object drawing utility\n<li> Monte Carlo - simulates rolling two dices showing the probability distribution based upon what is expected and observed\n<li> Character Generator - utility for editing UDGs (user defined graphics)\n<li> Waves - an acoustic equation of the &quot;Beat&quot; phenomena and the resulting of two Sine Waves\n</ol>",
