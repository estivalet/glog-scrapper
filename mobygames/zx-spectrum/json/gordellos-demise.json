  "description": "<i>Gordello's Demise</i> is the second and final game in Tartan's &quot;Gordello&quot; series of split-screen text adventures. In the previous game, you worked to defeat the evil Dr. Gordello who schemed to take over the world by replacing world leaders with clones under his control. Unfortunately, your victory in that game wasn't real: it was just a dream. Now in control of an &quot;AA&quot; clone with the ability to control the actions of other Gordello clones, you have to defeat the doctor again. Gameplay is a text adventure in a split screen. The player can control both his primary clone as well as a second nearby clone such as a gardener, a boxer, and others he/she will discover along the way. It is essential to use the skills of the various clones together to solve the game. Text is entered through a simple two-word parser and the screen is split to show both player viewpoints at a time. <br><br>This game also includes a playable version of the final third of &quot;The Gordello Incident&quot;, the previous game in the series, to allow new players to be familiar with the story and the environment.
