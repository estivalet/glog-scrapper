  "description": "<i>Kirel</i> is a 2.5D isometric puzzle game (the gameplay is in full 3D, camera can be rotated by 90 degrees). The player controls the &quot;Kirel&quot; creature, and he must catch bombs, and find exit items to get to the next level. <br><br>Kirel can manipulate environment blocks, but only one at a time, and can not jump to a height/lower greater than 1 block. He also must avoid  monsters - they are almost unkillable, unless Kirel has a special item. Every contact with them quickly drains Kirel's stamina - our creature can find food items to easily kill enemies. The game has 70 levels.",
