  "description": "<i>Crack City</i> is a single player, text adventure with optional graphics. It is the first game in <i>The Snow Dogs Trilogy</i> and it is also the last as the second game <i>A Handful Of Snow</i> was never completed<br><br>This game is set in 2003, which at the time of release was 'the near future', in the city of New Washington. The Mafia are working with a ruthless drugs organisation which the player, a secret agent, is tasked with infiltrating. The player can play as one of three secret agents, Mike Hammelford - a good shot but no fighter; Louis Chorbenski - a giant of a man but not too bright; Ed Macpherson - English and a good all-rounder, the player also has an assistant, Dwight, who can be instructed to perform tasks. <br>The screen layout used is different to most text adventures. The upper part of the screen is divided into panels, on the right is a panel showing the number of items being carried in the player's pocket, wallet and hands. In the centre is a picture of the current location and on the left is a panel showing the exits from the current location. Below all this are seven sets of numbers showing the time of day, available cash, agent's skill, SIF rating - how good a spy you are, health, score and number of turns taken.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as more advanced commands such as RAMSAVE and RAMLOAD\n",
