  "description": "<i>SolarGun</i> is a psychedelic Sci-Fi side scrolling top-down shooter arcade game with the main goal to endlessly destroy the asteroids and avoid colliding with them. The game gets more difficult by the progressive increasing number of asteroids and their increasing velocity. The player commands a spaceship armoured with a laser blaster which takes a certain amount of time to be re-charged. The laser beams can take multiple asteroids at the same time if they are aligned at the same row of the blast.",
