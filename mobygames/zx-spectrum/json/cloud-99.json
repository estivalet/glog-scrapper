  "description": "<i>Cloud 99</i> is a single player text adventure. It was released in two forms, one side of the tape had a pure text adventure version of the game while the version on the other side had graphics.<br><br>The game sees the player waking from a dream to find that Jack Frost has been tinkering with the weather and it's the player's job to put things right. Unusually for a text adventure there's an on-screen game clock which runs whether the player is making a move or just sitting there trying to decide what to do next, the clock is there because the game must be completed before dawn comes.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well U/D for Up and Down\n",
