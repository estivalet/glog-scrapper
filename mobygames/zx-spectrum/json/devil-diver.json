  "description": "Devil diver is a aquatic hunting treasure game with a constructing element similar to &quot;Jetpac&quot; (Ultimate, 1983). Its gameplay is very similar to &quot;Glug Glug&quot; (CRL Group PLC, 1984) following inclusive the tradition of the &quot;Scuba Dive&quot; (Durell Software Ltd., 1983) genre of discovering treasury. The player commands a diver who is wearing a modern diving suit, allowing him to move freely in opposition to Glug Glug's early diving suit which is restricted by a limited range of movements caused by the dependency of the breathing cable. Concerning Devil Diver's case, the player only has to worry about his oxygen supply. <br><br>The main goal of each level alternates between constructing a continuous pipeline and the hunting treasure. Every time a piece of the pipeline is either bad or properly embedded, a treasure has to be taken and collected when taken aboard. Every time a treasure is taken aboard, the player can comfortably rest on the ship secured from the aquatic dangers. This process goes until the submerged pipeline is completed and the last treasure is taken aboard. Only then the next section of the pipeline will be available.<br><br>While submerging the player is armoured with a fishing spear-gun provided with limited ammunition and equipped with a jar of oxygen. Every time the player goes aboard, both supplies are restored. ",
