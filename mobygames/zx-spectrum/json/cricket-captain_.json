  "description": "This version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Cricket+Captain\">Cricket Captain</a> lacks the ability to play the matches that is featured in the others. Instead, the C64 displays a running scorecard, while on the Spectrum the whole screen is used for a top-down view of the field, with lines illustrating where each shot was played, and flash announcements of dismissals. Only balls from which a player is dismissed or a run is scored are shown.<br><br>Scouts, coaches and physios are not hired, you simply have a standard one throughout. CPU v CPU matches produce a simple result instead of a full scoreline. Minor counties are not featured; cup tournaments start from the last 16 stage<br><br>A few other changes have been made. Player abilities in each field are now rated out of 10 instead of 100, but a player's bowling style and preferred bowling style to bat against are now featured. The scout now brings information about a team's players, and then gives you the chance to buy one of them, instead of searching for players of a particular ability.",
