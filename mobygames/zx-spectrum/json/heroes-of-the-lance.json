The party consists of the 8 Heroes of the Lance, using one at a time and the player can switch between them at any time.  Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies as well as acting as lives.<br><br>One of the <i>AD&amp;D</i> games that takes a break from the usual RPG style.",
