  "description": "<i>Crystals Of Kings</i> is a two part text adventure. The story starts with a world ruled by the House Of Brenn where peace and harmony reign because the rulers have at their disposal four crystals which they use for the good of all. <br><br>All good things come to an end and one night an evil mage, Medillion Karma, stole the crystals for his own use. Wars started, kingdoms fell, and evil spread throughout the lands.<br><br>In part one  the player is tasked by king Careth Brenn to retrieve the crystals. Part two starts with the player having all four crystals in their possession and they must use them to kill Medillion Karma and defeat his army.<br><br>The game was released in two forms, first came a tape version and later there was a disc re-release. The disc form has a menu which gives the player the following options<li>1. Read the instructions to part one\n</li><li>2. Start part one\n</li><li>3. See the instructions to part two\n</li><li>4. Start part two</li>If the player opts for either of the instruction options then, once the text has been read, they are positioned at the start of that part of the game<br><br>The tape version automatically displays the instructions for part/side one/two before starting the game at that point.<br><br>A map is often essential in text adventure games and this game is unusual in that it offers to show the player a game map before the start of both part one and part two, however there is a caveat that 'for obvious reasons not all locations are shown'<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Adventure Builder System</i> and therefore supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W/X for North/South/East/West/Examine.\n",
