  "description": "The original 8-bit predecessor to the now better known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/f-19-stealth-fighter\">F-19 Stealth Fighter</a>. Take control of a top secret classified Lockheed F-19 and fly missions in Libya, the Persian Gulf, Scandinavia, and Central Europe, with a variety of selectable mission parameters such as rules of engagement, escalation of conflict, risk, type of target, and skill levels with regards to landing and fighting.<br><br>Similar in scope and design to F-19 Stealth Fighter, but otherwise a completely different game, with graphics and physics more aligned with the capabilities of Gunship than with its 16-bit remake, completely lacking its speed, polygonal complexity, and features such as external chase camera, tactical views, and side/rear views. According to original co-designer Arnold Hendrick, &quot;The only thing borrowed from the C64 would be the game scenario concepts, military equipment research data, and perhaps some flight dynamics algorithms&quot;.",
