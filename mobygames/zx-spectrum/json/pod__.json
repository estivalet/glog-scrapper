  "description": "<i>Pod</i> is a 2D shooting game for one or two players and a clone of the Arcade classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Centipede\">Centipede</a>. Controlling a character at the bottom of the screen the player shoots at centipede-like PODs as they weave through an environment of Borg trees to get close. The PODs needs to be shot before they can touch the player's character, which removes one of the three starting lives. A spider also often appears and needs to be shot. Next levels always become a little faster. A bonus ship is provided for every 20,000 points.",
