  "description": "<i>Overlord: The Invasion 6th June 1944</i> is a turn-based war game based on Operation Overlord: the Allies' invasion of German-occupied France during World War II.<br><br>The player takes control of British, American and Canadian forces. After setting the difficulty to one of three levels (influencing the own troops' morale), the game begins by selecting five of twelve possible beaches for the own troops to land own, which need not necessarily be the historical ones. The landed armies have to move further inland before further reinforcements can be put on the beaches; airborne units can land farther from the shore, naturally.<br><br>On the displayed map of nothern France, armies are given orders by setting three different goal points (center, along with left and right flank). Depending on the composition of an army, they will automatically move to reach those positions the best way they can, but the individual divisions cannot be controlled. Along with the movement order, an attack strategy must also be set, to be used in case of enemy contact. The three options are attack (no matter the enemy's strength), defend (in which terrain properties come into play) or initiative (attack only if the odds look good). Battles are resolved automatically, figuring in troop type (infantry, mechanised or armored), remaining troop strength, terrain and morale.<br><br>The game ends when the Allies reach the right hand edge of the map or one side has only 40% strength left.",
