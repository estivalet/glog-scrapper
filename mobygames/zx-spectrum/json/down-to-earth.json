  "description": "<i>Down to Earth</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> inspired arcade game.<br>\nYour mission is to clear 30 different planets with your Astra-Dozers to make way for an interstellar by-pass commissioned by the Galactic Lifeform Commission in the year 3080. In order to do that you have to clear the levels of alien Circsaws, Trigons and Conenabs. Some of these are mortal enemies and can be pitted against each other. The aliens are trapped in soil pockets and are let out by dozer's activities. Aliens are disposed of either by dropping rocks on them or catching them in the blast of your limited supply of bombs. Bombs are also found in the soil and can be pushed on unsuspecting enemies. The bombs themselves will not harm you, but the blast of one will kill you as well as any adjacent enemies. The supply can be replenished  by picking up craters filled with bombs.",
