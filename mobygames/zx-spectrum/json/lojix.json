  "description": "<i>Lojix</i> is a polyomino puzzle game. Like other games of its kind the player's task is to place a number of shapes, each made up of four to seven squares, on a board so that they all fit with no overlap. There are 18 pieces and one is selected by pressing its corresponding letter. Once a piece has been picked up the player moves a cursor around the board before placing it. Each piece can be rotated before being placed. The game is entirely controlled with keyboard.",
