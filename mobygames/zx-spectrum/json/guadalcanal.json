  "description": "South-Western Pacific, August 1942. US Marines capture the strategically important island in the first American amphibious assault of World War 2, but the battle of <i>Guadalcanal</i> will rage on for the next six months, as the Japanese will try to re-capture it.<br><br>The player is given the command of air, land and naval forces, including aircraft carriers and transport ships (supply is crucial as well as intelligence - patrol seaplanes and scouts are available). While many wargames take the weather and morale factor into account, this game also features malaria slowly wearing down your troops. The campaign can be played from either American or Japanese side. The interface is icon driven and consists of a strategic map, a zoomed in tactical map and a unit details window.",
