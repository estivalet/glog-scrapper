  "description": "Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You have the choice to drive a Ferrari 187/88C, a McLaren MP4/4 or a Williams FW12, each with different qualities. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.<br><br>You can choose whether to drive a single race at Brazil, Britain, Monaco, (Western) Germany [Hockenheim], Canada, Italy, Detroit and Japan [Suzuka] or to drive a full championship on every track. Every Race includes a qualifying round. The graphics in the game are sprite-based.",
