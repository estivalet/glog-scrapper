  "description": "As Grandpa Joe, your target is complete the Glenlackofeagles course's 18 holes of golf within 72 shots - averaging four on each. This is no typical golf course however - it contains patches of astroturf, which cause the ball to change direction at random, as well as rough patches which slow the ball down. The course is displayed from above, with invisible walls surrounding the screen causing 180-degree rebounds.<br><br>Inputting shots is done by inputting a compass direction (such as 'n' or 'sw') and a shot weight in pixels. Everything is calculated in BASIC, a fact apparent from the standard input command.",
