  "description": "The game is set on Christmas Eve, with Santa (Father Christmas) rushing to deliver presents to the entire world.<br><br>After the player enters his/her name (which is used later in the personal letter to Santa), the first level takes the form of a flip-screen collecting game with Santa at home gathering the scattered pieces of his sleigh. If he collides with one of the elves running around, the item he is carrying is lost and has to be found again.<br><br>The player chooses six presents they want (computer, doll, book, etc.), which are listed on their letter to Santa. Santa then collects the presents as they fall from the top of the screen.<br><br>Finally Santa can deliver the presents, riding his sleigh over several horizontally-scrolling continents. The presents are dropped with parachutes and should be delivered to the homes indicated by arrows. Clouds and aeroplanes can knock them off course.",
