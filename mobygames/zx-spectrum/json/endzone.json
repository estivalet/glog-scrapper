  "description": "<i>Endzone</i> gives you the chance to manage an American Football team and take them from Division Two to Division One and win the Superbowl. There are a variety of options available but the choices that affect your team and results are limited with you able to change your team and buy and sell players. Once you are happy with your choices then you can play the next game. The match highlights screen consists of just text and you watch a clock count upwards through the four quarters and any scoring incident appears as it happens.",
