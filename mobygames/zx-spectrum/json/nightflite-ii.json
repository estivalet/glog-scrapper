  "description": "<i>Nightflite II</i> is a refinement of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nightflite\">Hewson's first Spectrum flight simulation</a>. The player can practice taking off, landing safely on the runway, navigation, and everything in between in a simulated passenger plane, at one of six skill levels. Raise and lower the nose and throttle to control airspeed and vertical speed as well as angle of approach, and dealing with flaps and the landing gear on approach, avoiding stalling. ILS and VOR screens, plus a map, help you navigate safely in the mountainous terrain with limited visibility (though there are runway lights to help with approaching to land)<br><br>There's now a demo mode, which is triggered automatically after 40 seconds on the main menu without selecting an option. After the flight you receive a report signed by the programmer on whether you achieved a safe landing, a rough landing, or a crash.",
