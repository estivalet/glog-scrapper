  "description": "Calling it a 'simulator' was a stretch, as with many of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Codemasters\">Codemasters</a>' titles. In reality it was an overhead-view <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a> style arcade racer for 1 or 2 players, similar in many ways to the company's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bmx-simulator\">BMX Simulator</a>. <br><br>There were up to 14 circuits depending on the format, which incorporated many underpasses (some of them deliberately unrealistic) and tight curves. There were oil slicks to avoid and points bonuses to pick up.<br><br>The cars have slow acceleration but a lot of power down the straights. You are scored based on your overall time and your fastest lap. Lose to the computer car and it's game over.",
