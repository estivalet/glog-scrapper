  "description": "Boris the Bee (star of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/birds-and-the-bees\">the first game</a>) has been kidnapped by a gang of <i>ant</i>isocial Chavs, and his f<i>ant</i>astically-named cousin Barnabee must rescue him.<br><br>You control Barnabee as he travels through the underground ant complex, which has two different entry points from the four above-ground screens which are initially in view. In the main bulk of the game, the side view screens contain ants which must be <i>ant</i>icipated and avoided, as they reduce your strength. The action is rather fr<i>ant</i>ic at times. At the risk of being ped<i>ant</i>ic, you need to touch flowers to restore your energy through pollen.<br><br>The game arrangement is a maze, with many flowers which remove barriers elsewhere in the maze. Many individual screens are self-contained mazes, with barriers which are removed when you move or fly into them. In keeping with the maziness, many screens have more than 2 exits. Once you find Boris, you must guide him back to the surface at his speed (which, without being flipp<i>ant</i>, is slower than yours).",
