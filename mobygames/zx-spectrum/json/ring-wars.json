  "description": "Hundreds of ring worlds are converging on our solar system devouring everything on their path. Now it's up to the player to stop them.<br><br><i>Ring Wars</i> features several parts. First, you follow the intelligence reports and locate ring worlds orbiting a planet. Traversing hyperspace, you engage in combat with the ring world defensive fleet, and, after it's defeated, enter the ring world itself. There, you set up a nuclear bomb within its reactor, and have to flee before its timer runs out. Then you depart, setting course to a friendly moon base, to reload your lasers, mount another nuclear bomb, and repair. After a while, the mothership defense goes low enough for you to pursue it. Defeat it and the menace is no more.",
