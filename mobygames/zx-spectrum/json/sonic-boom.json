Players must face six levels of cannon-fodder enemies in order to prevent the world being destroyed, but has 5 continues with 3 lives each to make use of. There is a boss at the end of each level which must be beaten in a time limit in order to progress. Most enemies are aircraft, but there are also tanks, trains, and turret installations to wipe out.
