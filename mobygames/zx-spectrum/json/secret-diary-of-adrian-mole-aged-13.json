  "shortName": "secret-diary-of-adrian-mole-aged-13",
  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,488206/\">Sue Townsend</a> created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd idea for a computer game, but <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Level+9+Computing%2c+Ltd%2e\">Level 9</a> felt that there was an adventure in there.  <br><br>Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. <br><br>The game does't use many typed commands. Instead the player reads passages of text (many of them from the book) and is given 3 choices as to what to do, which lead to other events unfolding.  You can also use a help option which displays information about characters featured in the diary. Your aim throughout all of this is to make Adrian as popular as possible.  The player's score and ranking is displayed at particular times during the game.  The percentage achieved relates to the rank, with 26% being 'a spotty creep' and 38% 'a middling thicko' for example.
