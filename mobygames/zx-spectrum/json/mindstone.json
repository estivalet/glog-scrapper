King Jorma impels on his older son Kyle to track Nemesar down, bring back the Mindstone, and return peace to the land.<br><br><i>Mindstone</i> is a side-view RPG. The player controls a four-person team - Kyle, and his trusted associates Merel, Quin and Taina, each with different strength and psyche (spellcasting skill), finding food or meditation to respectively enhance them.
