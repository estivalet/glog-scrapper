  "description": "<i>Apocalypse</i> is a turn-based strategy game, based on the board game from Games Workshop. Players have several territories on a map and must conquer land. The game has several phases: in the deployment phase players may build army divisions, navy warships and long-rage nuclear missiles on locations that they already occupy. In the movement phase, players can manoeuvre forces and engage in conventional combat. The nuke phase is the only opportunity to launch nukes. The game doesn't have CPU opponents and is multiplayer only. Up to 4 players are supported.",
