  "description": "<i>The Forest</i> is an orienteering simulation that recreates 37 kilometres of forest. A map of the area is supplied, with 10 checkpoints marked out, each of which must be reached. The landscape includes realistically mapped features, such as marshland, buildings, mine-shafts and different types of trees, each of which will make motions lower or more tiring. The exact angle at which you move varies slightly with each step, meaning that you'll have to be careful to stay on course.",
