  "description": "As an MI5 agent (at one of seven skill levels, 001 to 007) you must infiltrate enemy terrain to explore it, in advance of your nation's next war. This job is done in two stages. First, you parachute in to the area, and must land on top of a motorcycle, supplied by the resistance movement. These are scrolling along the screen at random intervals, with three different colours of bikes and different (randomly-altering) points values for these. Guide your man left and right to ensure that he reaches the ground as one of the bikes passes.<br><br>Successfully land on a bike and you reach phase 2, which is the motorcycle-riding action. A minefield is presented in front of you, and you must weave left and right, adjusting your speed as you go, to avoid mines and other obstacles. Points are awarded depending on how far you progress - complete it and you are promoted, ensuring that things repeat at a higher speed. Up to five players can take part, in turn.",
