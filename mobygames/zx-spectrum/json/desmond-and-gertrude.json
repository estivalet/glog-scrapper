As you'd expect Gertrude's daddy isn't too thrilled on the match and so does two things. First he builds a great big wall cutting Desmond's part of the village off from Gertrude's, then he arranges another suitor,  Sir Hugh de Bottomley, for the poor lass. <br>The objective of the game is to help the lovers get to a rendezvous so that they can meet and elope.  <br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well X for EXAMINE<br>\nThis game is a bit unusual as the player takes the role of both characters and uses a SWAP command to switch between them.\n",
