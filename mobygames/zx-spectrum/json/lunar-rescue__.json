  "description": "<i>Lunar Rescue</i> is a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Taito+Corporation\">Taito</a>'s arcade game of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue stranded astronauts from the surface of the moon. A mothership moves back and forth at the top of the screen, and from it the player drops spacecraft that he has to safely land on the moon's three landing platforms. The game is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lunar+Lander\">Lunar Lander</a> but here the player has to navigate through an asteroid belt. The player can steer left and right and use the thrust to decrease the speed. Once the player has landed successfully, an astronaut will enter the craft and the player can take off again. Unlike the original arcade game this version doesn't feature any aliens, so the player has to make his way through the asteroid field a second time. There are six astronauts that need to be rescued but the craft only can only take one at a time so the player has to do six trips to bring them all back home. The more astronauts are rescued the more dense the asteroid belt will become.",
