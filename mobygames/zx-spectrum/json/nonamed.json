  "description": "So you want to be a Knight of the King Abdul Honeickam Gargoy, young countryman? I can see that you are accurate with the arch, fast with the sword, and tough in hand-to-hand combat... but you need to prove that you're brave enough!<br><br>My boy, you'll be locked in the Castle with no name. You've to survive the nightmare world inside... and escape alive! Others have tried without success, and were sadly transformed into ogres by the evil mage Nirlem. Good luck!<br><br>This was one of the first games by Dinamic. It's a challenging side-scrolling game with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ghosts+N+Goblins\">Ghosts N' Goblins</a> style gameplay, with some strange monsters (you know, the Castle was previously owned by Alucard!) and potions that can help you a bit. By the way... you can climb ropes, and will frequently need to.",
