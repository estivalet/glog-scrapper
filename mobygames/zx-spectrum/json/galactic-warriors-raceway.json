  "description": "<i>Galactic Warriors + Raceway</i> is a pack of 2 original games that weren't published individually. <br><br><h3>Galactic Warriors</h3> \nEarth is being menaced by an overwhelming alien fleet which is progressively getting close to our planetary bounds. On the far reaches of the galaxy, Earth's Star Fleet has already been losing territory to the Aliens, who were successful in breaching their defences.<br><br>Now the only obstacle that separates Earth from the menacing force and is capable of repelling their invasion is <i>Earth's defence network of Laser Cannons</i>. Stationed on strategic orbiting asteroids in various sectors of space, this defensive network is Earth's last hope of survival. <br><br>Aliens are sending small squads of their <i>Emperors Elite Force of Galactic Warriors</i> as a first wave of strategic attacks to destroy Earth's Laser Cannons and prevent their <i>Alien Battle Cruisers</i> from being destroying by them. The second invasion might be near and could put a shadow on Earth's bright future. The only resistance left is the player's efforts to stop the Alien fleet.<br><br><i>Galactic Warriors</i> is a traditional <i>Centipede</i> space shoot-em-up variation. The mentioned <i>Emperors Elite Force of Galactic Warriors</i> is represented by a wave of enemies that fire deadly indestructible bolts. One by one, line by line each <i>galactic warrior</i> gets progressively close to the ground and therefore bellow the player's Laser Cannons line of fire, ultimately making the grounded alien warriors impossible to be destroyed except by casual fire. For each enemy shot, a carcass is generated and each one of those requires two shots to be destroyed. The player controls three <i>Laser Cannons</i> that are provided with a shield which can be activated for a brief period of time. When used, the <i>Laser Cannons</i> cannot fire otherwise they'll be destroyed.<br><br><h3>Raceway</h3> \nIn <i>Raceway</i> the player is in control of an acrobatic motorcycle and has to overcome several obstacles by driving his vehicle over them at the correct speed. After succeeding doing so, the player has to reach the finishing line of the scenario consisted by a wall without crashing into it. If successful, this is considered to be a clear stunt and the process repeats itself.<br><br>The game is composed of a single scenario divided by 4 floors, with three of them having three distinct types of obstacles specific to each floor: pools, cars and barrels. Except for the cars, the length of each sequence of obstacles is randomly generated every time the player starts a new game, loses a motorcycle or successfully reaches the finishing line. The last one is situated at the end of the last floor. Only the sequence of cars will increase proportionally after each clear stunt.<br><br>The controls of the game are restricted to increasing and decreasing the speed of the motorcycle.",
