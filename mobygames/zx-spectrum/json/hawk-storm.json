  "description": "Hawk Storm is a brave warrior living on the planet Edos, and its citizens look up to him for survival. Edos has only one source of energy: the giant capacitoid crystals, capable of storing energy by day and regenerate that energy during the icy cold nights. Having realized this, the evil Nevik warriors decided to steal all but two of these crystals, making it impossible to sustain normal life on the planet. As a result, all of the people are forced to go in a Life Suspension Program, except Hawk, who must recover all thirty-two stolen crystals if Edos is to survive.<br><br>The Neviks are scattered throughout Edos to make sure that Hawk does not succeed in his quest, but Hawk can collect up to three different weapons – shields, mines, and stryders – that can be used against them. Also scattered around are various hazards such as firepits, slimeballs, spikes, and gun turrets, which can cause Hawk to lose some energy if he collides into them. There are several objects which Hawk can use to his advantage. Energy pods can restore his energy, lifts can be used to reach higher platforms, and teleports can take him to different areas.<br><br>",
