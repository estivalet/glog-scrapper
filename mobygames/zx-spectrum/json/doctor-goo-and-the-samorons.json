  "description": "In this game you play the role of &quot;Doctor Goo&quot;, who has been given the task of stopping the evil Samorons from taking over the galaxy. The game is a totally unofficial version of the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Doctor+Who+Licencees\">Doctor Who</a> text adventures but the characters' names are spelled differently. You start off in your time machine and have to type commands to go to different places and solve puzzles. The style of the game is more comical with lots of jokes.",
