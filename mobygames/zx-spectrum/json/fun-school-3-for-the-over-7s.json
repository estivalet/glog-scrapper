The child must adjust the mistakes to move on to the next paragraph.<br><br>The two utilities consist of:<br><br><b>Robot Draw:</b> The child can draw various shapes with a turtle on the screen. The child must click on various options to tell the turtle where to move by direction, angle and distance.<br><br>\n<b>Database:</b> This utility gives the child the chance to use a database by putting in their own information with the use of various options. A quiz on the information entered can also be played.",
