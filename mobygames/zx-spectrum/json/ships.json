  "description": "<i>Ships</i> is an adaptation of the Battleship game. The player and the computer have a 10 by 10 board where five ships are located. Two of the ships occupy three tiles, the others occupy two, four and five tiles. The ships can be of any straight or curved shape, as long as all of a ship's tiles are connected by their sides. The human player can set up their ships themselves, or allow the computer to generate his ship placement randomly. <br><br>During the game, the players take turns to target specific squares on the other's board, and are told if they have hit a ship or missed. The game ends when one of the players loses all his ships. ",
