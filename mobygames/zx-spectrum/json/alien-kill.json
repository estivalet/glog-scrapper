  "description": "<i>Alien Kill</i> is an arcade action game that borrows in an unusual way from titles like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a>. In a single, fixed screen environment the player controls a character at the bottom and needs to kill an alien at the top, hidden behind a large wall with multiple layers.<br><br>The character can be moved horizontally and shoots vertically in a straight line using a magnum laser. Instead of breaking the wall down with a paddle the character needs to break the wall's bricks one by one using the gun to reach the alien and hit it multiple times to kill it before time runs out.<br><br>The alien has more defences such as an indestructible &quot;tungstidium&quot; barrier that often moves in front of the character and absorbs shots, like a reverse take on a paddle. In addition there is a barrier of white monsters in front of the alien and those require two shots to take them out. Points are scored for hitting the alien, destroying bricks and killing the white monsters. When the alien is killed before time runs out 1,000 points are provided. There are three difficulty levels. The time left is shown through a meter at the bottom that slowly decreases.",
