  "description": "In this beat 'em up game you control Hercules, the illegitimate son of Zeus and the mortal woman Alcmene. Hera, Zeus' wife, therefore hates Hercules and made him kill his two children. \nThe King of Argos gives him 12 labours that he has to fulfill.<br><br>These twelve labours are symbolized by icons that appear occasionally on the screen. You have to collect these labours while fighting off skeletons that carry swords.  The fights take place in ancient Greek temples amongst other places.\nIf you hit a labour it will put into an urn but a spider tries to steal the labours from you. Kill it with a well placed blow.\nIf all twelve labours have been collected he must face the the end boss of the game, the mighty Minotaur.",
