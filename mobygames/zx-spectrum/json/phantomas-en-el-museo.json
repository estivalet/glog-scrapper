  "description": "<i>Phantomas en el Museo</i> is part of a long-running series of fangames all based on the 1986 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas\">Phantomas</a>. This title was released on The International Museum Day in 2012 and was made at the request of the IAACC Pablo Serrano de Zaragoza in Spain. The game was made available for free, but could also be played inside the museum.<br><br>Android thief Phantomas receives a text one day that ghosts have taken over a museum. There is no further information, but using his geolocalization gadget he traces the message to a place called Zaragoza. Using his space ship he travels to the IAACC Pablo Serrano museum dedicated to the artist <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1020235/\">Pablo Serrano Aguilar</a> from Crivillén, a small town in Teruel, with sculptures made by him and paintings by his wife <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1020234/\">Juana Francés</a>. Phantomas discovers the museum has been taken over by Malotes, a criminal gang of afterlife beings. They have destroyed most of the museum, except for five pieces of contemporary art and it is those Phantomas has to locate. The pieces are «Fajadito» (1964), the «Ritmo en el espacio» (1959), the «Drama y quema del objeto» (1957-1959), the «cabeza de Machado» (1984) and «una pequeña guitarra» (1985).<br><br>This 2D platform game consists of several single-screen rooms linked both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic to form a single, large museum level with some freedom for exploration. Phantomas can only move and jump, he has no means to attack. He needs to avoid enemies and hazards. He has access to two types of jumps, a high one and a long one. Both are needed to complete the platforming sections. He starts with 255 health and that is drained as soon as he comes in contact with an enemy or a hazard. Some energy can be refilled by eating refills found in some screens that look like «Gran Pan Partido» (1978), another sculpture by Pablo Serrano. Some parts are locked and can only be accessed after locating an access card first. When one of the five pieces is discovered in any order, it is coloured in the HUD to help track progress.",
