  "description": "In <i>robotfindskitten</i>, the name is the game: You are robot, and you have to find kitten. Sounds simple. <br><br>Problems start with the fact that there are other objects which are not kitten! Even worse: You don't know which objects are kitten and which are not! The only way to differentiate them both is touching. If you touch a non-kitten, you get some quirky phrase, otherwise: robotfindskitten!<br><br>The game is a mindless yet meditative and (due to its idiosyncratic humour) quite fun lo-fi adventure-oid with some similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Roguelike+games\">roguelikes</a> (all-ASCII, single player, top-down randomized dungeon) and others to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/progress-quest\">Progress Quest</a>. <br><br>It also comes with an impressive base of platforms, having been ported to over 20 systems, encompassing old and new, consoles and home computers. Particularly interesting is the OpenGL 3D Windows version aptly named <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/robotfindskitten3d\">robotfindskitten3d</a>.",
