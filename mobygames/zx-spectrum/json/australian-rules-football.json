  "description": "This game is based on the sport Australian rules football, or Aussie rules.  It has two teams playing against each other in four, three minutes quarters and the aim is to score the most points at the end of the game to win.  <br><br>A goal, also known as a sausage roll, is scored if the ball goes through the middle posts and is worth six points while a behind is scored if the ball goes between the side posts, this is worth one point.  You can earn possession by tackling the opposition to win the ball.  There is also a chance that while in possession you can drop the ball which may cause you to lose possession.  Throughout the game, a commentator runs down the action and gives updates on the scores as they happen.<br><br>The game comes with two leagues.  The Outback Amateur League has you in control of the Koalas and you must win matches to move up the OAL ladder.  You take on teams such as the Rangers, the Butchers and the Wallabies and you must reach the top of the ladder to become champions.  The Victorian Football League is the professional league and provides a much tougher test.  Here you are the Hawks and teams like the Bombers, the Kangaroos and the Blues are your opposition and the aim is the same as the previous league, win matches to move up the VFL ladder and eventually reach to top to win the championship.\n",
