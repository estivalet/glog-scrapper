  "description": "<i>Football Manager 3</i> is a managerial simulation in which the player is responsible for the athletic success of a soccer team in Great Britain. The game is controlled via menus which are reached by clicking on graphics in a visualized office. The focus lies on the athletic aspect, e.g. tactics, training (can be set separately for each athlete ) or lineup, the financial aspect is mostly restricted to buying and selling athletes on the transfer market. Of course each athlete has a number of statistics associated which influence his performance on the field. The matches are shown in one of two two non-scrolling perspectives, either top-down or slightly angled from the side, on which relatively small player icons do their work.",
