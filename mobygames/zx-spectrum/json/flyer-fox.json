  "description": "In the world of <i>Flyer Fox</i>, civil aviation has become a highly dangerous endeavor. Aerial terrorists routinely shoot down commercial airliners. The only solution: a courageous pilot must man the new Flyer Fox fighter and escort the jumbo jets safely to their destination.<br><br>The game is a shooter, seen from the cockpit perspective of the Flyer Fox. Each level begins with an automatic takeoff so the Fox finds itself behind the airliner to protect. Soon, enemy fighters will appear and must be shot down with the Fox's guns to keep the jumbo from harm. Cockpit instrumentation includes a radar, a compass and an artificial horizon, to be used to locate any enemies and also to find one's way back to the protected plane. There is also a status line that displays the current damage level of the airliner. If either the jumbo is shot down or the Fox's fuel runs out before all enemies are shot down, it's game over. In later levels the difficulty increases, with the enemy planes being more agile and actually shooting back.<br><br>In an unusual feature for a mid-80s title, the game features synthesized speech, used for radio messages from the airliner.",
