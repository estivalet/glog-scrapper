  "description": "<i>Gwiezdne Imperium</i> (Star Empire) is a strategy game for two or more players. The game takes place on a board, where each square is occupied by a planet, a fleet (represented by an arrow pointing in a specific direction), or empty. Both players start off controlling one of the planets, marked with their color and symbol; the rest of the planets and fleets are neutral, and are white. The player wins the game if he is the only player left controlling any planets. <br><br>Each turn, the player can act a number of times, based on how many planets they are controlling. The player can create a fleet next to a planet; move a fleet; have a fleet or a planet destroy a fleet on a neighboring tile; or rotate a fleet. The player can take over fleets or planets by having his own fleet point at them. The &quot;neutral&quot;, white fleets likewise may take over any of a player's fleets or planets in this way, unless the player is keeping his own fleet pointing at the spot. If two players are pointing at the same object, it is considered neutral. ",
