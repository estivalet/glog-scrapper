  "description": "<i>Hitman</i> casts the player as a hired assassin for the mob, with nine police officers in your sights to take down one by one for increasing financial rewards. Before each mission starts a getaway plan (more expensive ones have a higher success rate) and weapon must be chosen. <br><br>The gameplay is split across two single-screen levels. First, the officer's hideout must be located. The screen presents a random network of buildings on a two dimensional space. Walk into one and the informant located there will direct you towards the correct location, via norht/south and east/west arrows. Track him down in time and the shootout begins. There is a time limit in which to hit the officer as he attempts to hide and ducks in and out of the screen (a backyard scene with bins on odd-numered levels, a building with eight windows on even-numbered levels. The shooting uses either a crosshair or a laser depending on your weapon of choice.<br><br>Higher skill levels give less attempts to locate the officer, make the shootout trickier, and increase the cost of escape methods. Instructions are provided on the tape, on the opposite side to the game program itself.",
