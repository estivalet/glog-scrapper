  "description": "<i>The Treasure of Lumos</i> is a treasure hunting game which combines the arcade, platform and adventure genres, and has some resemblances to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/jet-set-willy\">Jet Set Willy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/rick-dangerous\">Rick Dangerous</a>.<br><br>The game was initially released as a demo (v.1). This version only has 15 scenarios, the game is always straight forward, the edges of the platforms aren't polished, it doesn't have music and instead of teleporters it has fans.<br><br>The final version (v.2) has 28 scenarios, there are teleporters to move around the scenarios, the pixel art of the platforms is concluded and has music.<br><br>The game features a novice treasure hunter named Jack Scavenger whose mission is to find the Treasure of Lumos. In order to do that, he has to explore the Caves of Lune Mountain, where he will find 45 relics and several keys to open the closed doors in his path. There are many hazards and once Jack touches one of them he loses 1 of the 5 initial lives (or 8, depending if you choose that option in the Starting Menu).<br><br>During the game, Jack can add another live by picking the right object and use a teleporter to get to some of the relics. Also, Jack has to be careful not to be burnt by the flames in the floor and ceiling. If successful, Jack can escape the Caves of Lune Mountain with the treasure in his Jeep.<br><br>",
