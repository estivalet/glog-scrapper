  "description": "This was the first of the two football games licensed around <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,601533/\">Paul Gascoigne</a>, then the most expensive player in British football history. The game is viewed top down, and can be set to either move left-right or top-bottom.<br><br>League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game goes on – if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition. \n",
