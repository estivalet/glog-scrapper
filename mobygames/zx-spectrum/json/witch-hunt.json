When you are invited into the house and you enter you realised you had found the witch. When she placed her hat on her head she disappeared leaving the hat behind and with no way to return home you did the same. You now have to escape the cellar and find your way home.<br><br><i>Witch Hunt</i> is a text only adventure with each screen describing your location as you type in your commands.",
