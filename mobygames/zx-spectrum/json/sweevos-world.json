  "shortName": "sweevos-world",
  "description": "The Self-Willed Extreme Environment Volitional Organism, or Sweevo for short, is a goofy-looking and generally incompetent robot. His world is Knutz' Folly, and it comprises almost 200 isometric-viewed screens of danger and challenge, making for a game influenced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Knightlore\">Knightlore</a>, although it takes a less serious approach to the genre. Sweevo can enter the world through four different vertical levels, and must use lifts and holes to cross through these to solve many puzzles.<br><br>You will meet some decidedly weird inhabitants. Most dangerous are the Dictators and Minxes - contact with these will drain Sweevo's energy, as will contact with water (he's a robot, remember). Energy can be recharged by scaring the Geese and picking up the tokens this reveals. The main score is a percentage, although several other totals are kept - most unusually 'Brownie Points', through contact with the brownies.",
