  "description": "<i>Buccaneer</i> is a run of the mill side scrolling shooter with the stereotypical premise. Aliens have invaded earth and you and your sole fighter craft are the only hope for mankind. Waves and waves of alien scum fill the screen shooting bullets and missiles at you, your job is to eradicate every single one of them. A fuel meter tickers down constantly and you have a shield that can absorb a few hits. Every once in a while a mother ship appears and you can dock to restore fuel and shields.",
