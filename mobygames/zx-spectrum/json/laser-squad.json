Before taking them into battle (viewed from above and progressing in turns), you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.<br>\nThe game also features a two player hotseat multiplayer option.<br><br>Initial ZX Spectrum release (and C64 &amp; Amstrad CPC cassette tape releases) had three missions:\n<ul><li>1: <i>The Assassins</i> - where you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards</li>\n<li>2: <i>Moonbase Assault</i> - which challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database</li>\n<li>3: <i>Rescue from the Mines</i> - eschew violence in favour of a rescue mission</li></ul>\nTwo more scenarios were available via mail order, later releases by Blade Software and subsequent ports already included them:\n<ul><li>4: <i>The Cyber Hordes</i> - defend a rebel station and its seven stabilizer cores from an advancing imperial droid invasion</li>\n<li>5: <i>Paradise Valley</i> - following the destruction of the stabilizer cores, escape from the colony with the device containing blueprints for advanced rebel starfighter</li></ul>Two additional missions were released with mail order <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Laser+Squad+Kit\">expansion kit</a>.\n",
