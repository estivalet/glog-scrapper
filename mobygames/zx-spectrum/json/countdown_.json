  "description": "<i>Countdown</i> is a Channel 4 TV show which has continued into the 2010s, despite the death of original host Richard Whiteley in 2005. It's a words-and-numbers game show, and the original format of 6 letters games, 2 numbers games and a conundrum, is recreated here. There is no computer opponent, so 2 people are required.<br><br>In the letters round, a selection of 9 letters is formed by alternately choosing a vowel or consonant, and the players have 30 seconds to find the longest available word. Generated letter combinations are not always realistic with the show. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Computer+Scrabble\">Computer Scrabble</a>, the full dictionary is not stored in memory, so the game will ask if the words you enter are real. The longest word scores its length, with 18 points for a 9 letter word - both players score for equal length words.<br><br>The numbers game also takes 30 seconds, and involves choosing 6 numbers from a set including 25,50,75 and 100 as well as 2 each from 1-10. Choose how many large numbers you want, and the set is chosen randomly. A three-figure target is randomly generated, and you have 30 seconds to add, subtract, multiply and divide to get as close to it as possible.<br><br>The conundrum finishes the show - it's a 9-letter anagram, which the first player to solve buzzes in to give his answer, scoring 10 points if correct.",
