  "description": "Falling-block puzzle game. Crates and creatures fall into the play area in random sets of three in an L-shape. The player can rotate and stack the shapes in an on-screen hopper. Complete rows of crates are eliminated. Creatures can only be eliminated by the titular 'Buzzsaws' - circular saw blades which occasionally appear among the L-shaped pieces and which run left, right and down, cutting through any lines of creatures. Ton-Weights and Star-Bombs also appear as rare extras and these eliminate creatures in different ways.<br><br>Points are awarded for rows of crates completed and creatures eliminated. Score multipliers apply the more rows or creatures are eliminated in chain-reactions from placing a single piece.<br><br>It is the first game ever produced for the ZX Spectrum to use 'Multicolour' in-game sprite graphics that exceed the machine's standard restriction of 2 colours in any one character cell.<br><br>A version titled 'Buzzsaw+ (Box Deluxe Mix)' is also supplied on the cassette version from Cronosoft, which has red (not green) blood spatter effects and re-coloured creatures.<br><br>The game borrows the basic play mechanics from NAMCO's arcade game 'Cosmo Gang The Puzzle', itself based on a ticket-reward shooting gallery redemption game 'Cosmo Gang'. This was similarly the basis of the home console game 'Pac-Attack'. However, Buzzsaw+ supplies fewer weapons and takes longer to raise the play speed, allowing the player to take a more strategic approach to gameplay and build up impressive chain-reactions for higher scores.",
