  "description": "<i>The last Vampire</i> is 2D top down action adventure game. The player is a nameless warrior, who must kill Count Dracula. It's not an easy task, he must collect the right items - a stake and a silver hammer and of course, find the vampire lord. Our hero must fight against vampire bats and pirates along the way and in a shop he can buy new items, like keys - but to be able to do so, he must collect gold and silver coins. The player can carry only two items at a time. The player's health is shown in the form of swords on the bottom of the screen - when the sword are depleted, the game is over.",
