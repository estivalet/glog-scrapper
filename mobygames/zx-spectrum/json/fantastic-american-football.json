  "description": "<i>Fantastic American Football</i>, as the title suggests, a computer version of the popular American sport football. Before you play you have a number of options at your disposal and these include length of half ( one to five minutes), pick your team (based on the actual NFL teams from 1990) and if you want a one-player game against the computer, two-players versus each other or a full season. Each game is spread over four quarters. You can even change what keys to use on the keyboard.<br><br>Once you are happy with your selection it's on to the actual game. If you are kicking the ball at the start then you control the kicker with the direction and distance by the keyboard. If you receive then you control the player catching it using the keyboard. The game is split into two types of game Defence and Offence. In Defence you have the choice of three plays, Pass, Rush (running with the ball) and Blitz (everyone goes for the quarterback). You control a player and can move him about the field trying to stop the other team. In Offence you have the choice of four plays, Pass, Rush, Feild Goal and Punt. When passing you take control of the quarterback and you can decide the distance and angle of throw by the keyboard. If Rushing then you control the player running using the keyboard.<br><br>The game is viewed from the side at an elevated angle showing a small part of the pitch.",
