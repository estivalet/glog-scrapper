  "description": "<i>Zolyx</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/qix\">Qix</a> variant: the player is presented with a white playing field and controls a pixel. Whenever this pixel moves over the playfield, it leaves a line behind - and when the line becomes a closed form, it gets coloured. The goal is to colour 75% of the playfield; everything above gives bonus points for the high score list.<br><br>Well, it is not that easy. White pixels fly around the field and touching them result in death; similarly deadly is going backwards on a line. At least the player has two tricks to help himself: he can change the direction of the white pixels by pressing a button (limited) and jail them when drawing a closed line around them. This is possible because the pixels are either confined to the coloured or uncoloured parts. <br><br>After finishing a level a new one starts with three changes: one more white pixel, an extra life for the player and one additional usage of the &quot;direction change&quot; button.",
