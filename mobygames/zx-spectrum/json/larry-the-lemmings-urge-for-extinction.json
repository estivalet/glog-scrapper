  "description": "<i>Larry the Lemming's Urge for Extinction</i> is a humorous text adventure. In most games the object is to stay alive and solve puzzles, this game is different in that the objective is to help Larry to end it all.<br><br>Poor Larry, he's growing up and now he has urges. Now many a young lad just out of puberty has urges but Larry's are entirely focused on throwing himself off a cliff. Naturally his mum isn't too keen on the idea and makes him go everywhere with a rubber ring and a parachute.<br><br>Today Larry finds himself on a beach and it's his day to jump, but he's a bit frightened of the tourists. Can you help him?<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well X for EXAMINE and, essentially, JUMP.\n",
