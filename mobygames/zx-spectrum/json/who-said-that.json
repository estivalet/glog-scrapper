  "description": "In this game you play the role of the Whizzkid. The gameplay involves you collecting letters from the mouths in the corners of the screen and placing them in the sentence to spell out a famous saying. To hinder your progress are spinning wheels which both hurt you if you make contact and steal the letters from the sentence and take them back to the mouths where you have to go and collect them again. There is however a spray can that you can use to get the letter back off of a wheel. After completing a level you are told as the title suggests Who Said That.",
