  "description": "Potsworth the well-spoken dog and his Midnight Patrol chums (Rosie, Nick, Carter, Keiko and Freddy) were stars of a successful cartoon, one of the many Hanna-Barbera IPs turned into licensed games by Hi-Tec. The Nightmare Prince has stolen the Grand Dozer's sleep potion, and the pieces have been placed around the Dream Zone. The Midnight Patrol race into action to restore Dozer's decent night's sleep.<br><br>The game takes place across 5 levels of platform action. There are many switches, which are activated by pushing crates onto them. Moving platforms and small ledges ensure a test of timing and planning. There are hidden paths and bonuses to uncover, and dying always puts you back where you die with an invincibility period. Each character has its own special weapon or feature, all activated by hitting the fire key or button.",
