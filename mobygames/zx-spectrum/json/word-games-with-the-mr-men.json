It features these fun games that also develop reading skills:\n<ul>\n<li>Mr Noisy's Word Game</li> - Learn about opposites, comparatives and superlatives. There are nine different games to play, each of which can be selected from the main menu.\nOther games allow various combinations of reading and writing exercises ranging from matching up a picture with the correct word to choosing the opposite to a displayed word.<br><br><li>Read with Mr Bounce</li> - Learn words like 'above', 'inside', and 'on'. Again, there are several different options to teach different uses of the words.<br><br>Included with the game is a specially designed keyboard overlay with clear 'small' letters cutting out the confusing clutter on a computer keyboard and an illustrated instruction book to help an adult introduce the program to children, plus separate notes on the programs and the educational aspects.",
