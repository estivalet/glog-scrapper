  "description": "The player is the second officer of a space ship. He uses the Shadow Skimmer glider to make a routine inspection of the engines. Unfortunately the main computer malfunctions and closes the entry point. Now he needs to reach another hatch, but the defense systems see him as intruder.<br><br>The player needs to navigate through three top-down mazes and find the exit. Unfortunately those are not passable until the security systems are put down: it is necessary to find and destroy the hidden power device. Sometimes it is necessary to flip the glider on the back to pass through certain obstacles, but this makes the glider vulnerable for enemy attacks. Those, along with bumping against obstacles, decrease the glider's shield energy and when all three are gone, the game is lost.  The glider has a laser to shoot back. However, a killed enemy is instantly replaced by an indestructible enemy generator.",
