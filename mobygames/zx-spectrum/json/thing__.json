  "description": "THING! is a side view game combining the genres puzzle-solving and shoot'em up. It has also adventure and RPG elements and it has a cartoon and comical tone. Both characters, the Thing and the Ball are commanded by the player: The Thing is responsible for carrying and using objects and The Ball for the fire-power. The objects are accessed and managed through several options of a menu by pressing their respective numeric keys. There's the possibility of examining, using and exchanging them. <br><br>To complete a task or restore the character's health and ammunition, the player has to carry one or more compatible objects and use the correct one.Both characters status can also be accessed through the menu by pressing the number 4 key. It  will resume their health (of both characters) and the ammunition left (BALL). Every time the Thing is severely damaged due to the extent of its injuries, it's body is shut down for a period of 24 hours for repairs.<br><br>Regarding the game's plot, The Thing, an intergalactic postman, genetically engineered on the planet Crazee, was entrusted by the Astral Harmony Council with the diplomatic mission of rendering their political adviser to the Dingalinger Overlord. The adviser is an inhabitant of the planet Rombus and it has the form of a Ball.\n \nDuring the last months, tension between Dingalingers has been growing, negotiations have failed and the planet is on the verge of a nuclear war. Dingalinger Overlord has hidden himself away and only agrees to meet the adviser if the Thing manages to complete 10 tasks in 7 days. It has to be very careful because there are many Dingalinger gangs roaming on many of the 26 districts of the planet the Overlord is hiding.They are very hostile to any Thing trespassing their land. These districts can be travelled through a teleporting system called Telephonex.<br><br>To use the Telephonex and travel to other districts of the planet, the Thing has to be placed in front of a telephone booth and use his telephone book, which is the only object in his possession in the beginning of the game. These travelling points are called Kiosks. The player has to manage both characters health and ammunition to assure they'll survive the many dangers encountered on their travels, before successively completing their mission before the end of the week. If he fails, the Overlord will nuke his own planet and the game will be over.<br><br>",
