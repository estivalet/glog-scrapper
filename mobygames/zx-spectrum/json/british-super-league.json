  "description": "<i>British Super League</i> is a football management game where you have to take a team from a choice of 16 teams and make them British Super League champions. The teams involved are a mixture from England and Scotland and each team plays each other twice. Your choice of options to influence the game are limited and they are the ability to change formation and positions of players, and to buy and sell play players in the transfer market. Once you are happy with your choices you then move to the next game. The whole pitch is viewed from above on the screen and you see yours and the oppositions players with a commentator saying which player has the ball. Players will flash in the area of the ball. A clock counts from 0 - 90 minutes and you are able to use two substitutes at any time during the game.",
