  "description": "<i>ZX Football Manager 2005</i> is a sports management game where the player can choose one of sixteen English Premier League clubs (four clubs from the 2004/2005 season are missing: West Bromwich, Crystal Palace, Norwich and Southampton). The game uses an icon based interface and as manager the player has to deal with picking a starting eleven, sending scouts out to find players and buying and selling players. Coaches can be asked to leave reports on the team and it is also possible to ask them pick the players. The actual matches are auto played with no input from the player. Only results and basic statistics (goal scorers, yellow and red cards, injured players) are given for each match. In addition to the league there is a four round cup competition to compete in. ",
