  "description": "This game is a Spectrum variant of Nintendo's smash hit <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Donkey+Kong\">Donkey Kong.</a>. The object of the game is to rescue the damsel in distress. She's distressed because Kong has kidnapped (gorillanapped?) her.<br><br>Kong sits at the top right of the screen with the aforementioned damsel who occasionally shouts 'Help' in text. You're at the bottom left of the screen and to rescue the maiden you must traverse a series of inclined girders and ladders.<br><br>Just to make it interesting, Kong sees you and starts rolling barrels and other obstacles down the girders towards you. These must be avoided by jumping over them, or smashing them with a hammer. There are 4 screens to complete and points are scored for smashing barrels, collecting gems, and completing screens.<br><br>\n",
