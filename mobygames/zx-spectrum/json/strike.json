  "description": "<i>Strike</i> is a game that allows you to play 10 pin bowling against a friend or a computer player (skill level 1-4). The game follows the rules of bowling where you have to knock down 10 pins at the end of the lane with two shots unless you get a strike on the first throw. You play over 10 rounds and the winner is the player with the highest score. The game has an isometric view showing the player at the start of the lane. <br><br>To throw the ball you first have to position your bowler by moving his feet left or right. When you are happy with your position you press up and hold down the fire button. You release the fire button at the right time as  you approach the line. Let go too soon and you drop the ball and hold on too long and you throw the ball in the air to land on your foot. If you release correctly you see the ball move up the lane and off screen. A box in the top left corner shows the pin positions and the ball hitting them. The bottom right has your scorecard. Once you have had your two shots then the computer or friend throws.  A joystick or keyboard is used to control your bowler.",
