  "description": "Traxx is a simple action game, with 9 speed settings and a 2 player mode. You are presented with a grid of 24 squares, each of which has lines around it, and your task is to colour in the whole grid. this is done by moving across these lines so as to colour each square individually. If you overshoot the one of the edges, or are forced to go into a different direction, you lose any lines which have been coloured on that block. Each square that you colour must already be next to one which is already coloured, but any sides which have already been used as part of another completed row needn't be re-coloured. Trying to stop you doing this are up to 9 aliens, each of which costs you a life on contact. After completing a level you get 10 seconds to eat the aliens for points, a lá <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>",
