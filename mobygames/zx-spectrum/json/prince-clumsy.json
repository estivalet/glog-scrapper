  "description": "Like so many brave men before him, Prince Clumsy has been lured into a tough adventure to save the woman of his dreams. The route to the castle in which her ugly sister has imprisoned her is treacherous and goes both indoors and out. You're armed with a dagger to face the many henchmen infesting the areas. Bread and ale can be collected to restore your health, and there are lots of points bonuses on offer. Less pleasant are the super glue, ball &amp; chain (ironic given that he's chasing a potential wife) and poison.",
