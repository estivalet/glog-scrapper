  "description": "<i>The Guardian</i> is a action game based on the arcade classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/tempest\">Tempest</a>.<br>\nYou are at the antimatter world of Mignon, can you survive the onslaught of Trackers, Anti-mines, Swirls and  Snarks?<br>\nThe game is vector based and takes place in a rectangular chute, seen from a three dimensional perspective from above. The player's claw-shaped vessel is on top of the chute and enemies appear at the bottom and rush up towards the player. The player moves sideways across the edges of the chute and shoots down it at the enemies as they rush upwards. A life is lost if the player's ship is hit by one of the enemies. The player starts with two 'Star Smashers', a type of smart bomb that clears the entire screen of enemies when used.<br>\nOccasionally there is a meteor shower round where the chute disappears and the player has to avoid meteors coming from the  center of the screen towards the edges.\n",
