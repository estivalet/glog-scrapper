  "description": "<i>Farmer</i> is a simulation game where the player has to run a wheat farm profitably. The objective is to increase assets to £500,000 in 50 to 75 weeks (depending on difficulty). The game is text based and played by entering commands. Electron and 48 KB Spectrum versions add some graphics such as a map of the farm and weather forecasts. Commands are entered weekly (monthly in some versions). For each week three decisions can be made. Possible options include buying land, seeds, tractors and harvesters, hiring labourers, planting seeds, fertilising, harvesting, irrigating, spraying against insects and selling crops. Problems that might be encountered include drought, insect attacks and rats eating seed corn.",
