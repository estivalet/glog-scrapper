  "description": "<i>Dracula</i> is a text adventure based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,144309/\">Bram Stoker</a>'s novel of the same name. The player takes the role of Jonathan Harker, a lawyer who visits a certain Count Dracula in his castle. The game is divided into three separate text adventures which can be played independently, but build up on each other. <i>The First Night</i> is about Harker's travels to the castle and <i>The Arrival</i> deals with his time in the castle. During <i>The Hunt</i>, the last third of the story, the protagonist changes to Dr. Seward, the manager of the insane asylum in Whitby, Yorkshire.<br><br>The game itself is mostly concerned with story telling and atmosphere; it is relatively light on puzzle solving. The parser only understands verb + noun combinations.",
