  "description": "<i>Magnetron</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/quazatron\">Quazatron</a>.<br><br>Robot KLP-2 returns to destroy a series of space stations around the planet Quartech. This is achieved by overloading or shutting down the four nuclear reactors in each station. KLP-2 has to carry nuclear fuel rods between the reactors, with each rod having a positive or negative charge and a weight. The more weight being carried, the slower KLP-2 moves and the harder it is to get up slopes. The charge affects how the robot reacts to arrow tiles on the floor - a positive charge moves the robot in the direction of the arrow, a negative charge in the opposite direction.<br><br>Throughout the space station are computer screens to give information, in a very similar method to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/paradroid\">Paradroid</a>. Enemies come in various types and have different weapons, with each showing a rank and droid number on the front. By standing still and holding down fire, KLP-2 enters grapple mode. Now he can run into an enemy and try to take control. This gives a 9x9 grid of symbols. Rearranging the bottom row disarms the detonator and allows KLP-2 to steal energy for a recharge. Rearranging all three rows allows KLP-2 to take over the other robot and use its abilities and weapons.<br><br>Once at the reactor, KLP-2 can add or remove a rod at a time. The aim is either to overload (by getting a big positive number) or shut down (by getting a big negative number). With all four reactors shut down, the lights dim and KLP-2 goes to a beam pad to move on to the next station.",
