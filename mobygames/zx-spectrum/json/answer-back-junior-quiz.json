  "description": "<i>Answer Back Junior Quiz</i> is a single player quiz program.<br><br>This is the basic program and it allows the player to create, save and play quizzes. Once a question bank has been created it can be saved. When playing the quiz the player has the option of playing either a Yes/No quiz, a multiple choice quiz, a 'complete the answer' quiz or a selection of all three.<br>\nThe player can also select the number of questions in the quiz, whether the questions are sequential or random and whether they are timed or not. If the player answers a question correctly they are treated to a small animation showing a princess being rescued by a dragon.<br><br>The main purpose behind this game however was not to play self-made quizzes, it was a vehicle by which add-on packs containing five hundred questions were sold. There was also an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Answer+Back+Senior+Quiz\">Answer Back Senior Quiz</a>.\n",
