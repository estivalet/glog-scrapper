  "description": "<i>Viaje al centro de la tierra</i> is a Spanish game based on the book <i>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</i> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,61309/\">Jules Verne</a>. This 8-bit release of the game consists of three parts:<ul>\n<li>In the first part you have to solve a jigsaw puzzle with a map from a first-person perspective by putting the parts in the correct order. There is a time limit.</li><br>\n<li>In the second part you can switch between three characters each controlled separately in a platform environment using a side view. Each character carries its own objects and attributes, while they enter the volcano on their way to the centre of the Earth. They have to pass water cascades, geysers and eventually a lake with a monster.</li><br>\n<li>In the third part again played from a side view you have to choose one of the three ways to get to the surface of the Earth. Each route is different and has its own dangers like tigers, carnivorous plants and quicksand.</li></ul>",
