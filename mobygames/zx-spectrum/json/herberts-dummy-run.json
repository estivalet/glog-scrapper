As in previous games <i>Herbert's Dummy Run</i> is an arcade adventure where you must pick up objects and place them in the right locations. You are only able to carry two objects at a time and some objects are needed to be found to help complete the various arcade sequences. Nasties need to be avoided as well and if touched part of your tear gauge is filled. If your tear gauge is filled then one of three lives are lost. Lose all three lives or run out of time then it is game over.<br><br>",
