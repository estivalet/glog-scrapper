  "description": "You play Drak, the last of the Obliterators (genetically enhanced machines bio engineered for otherwise impossible missions). Your mission is to save the Federation from an alien spacecraft. <br><br>Obliterator is an arcade style platform action game. The game screens are static (instead of scrolling, though you can optionally turn on scrolling transitions between screens) and can be maze-like at times, with many locations to search. Armed with a variety of weapons, you have to board the alien spacecraft, disable its weapons, plasma drives and shields, then escape. ",
