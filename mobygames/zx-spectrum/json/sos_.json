  "description": "Sydney the Droid has crash-landed his plane on Alpha Five, and he must search the city for the plane radio so that he can signal a rescue team to his location. While searching for the radio, Sydney must also avoid being eaten by robots that patrol the city. When he gets eaten, one of Sydney's three lives are lost and Sydney restarts from his present location.<br><br>His progress is blocked by several obstacles, including computer terminals, fences, and barriers, but these are removed by using them with objects found elsewhere. <br><br>The game is broken up into days, and as time passes, the city eventually gets dark, making progress impossible without a lantern. The bottom half of the game screen shows Sydney's status as well as what he is carrying. \n",
