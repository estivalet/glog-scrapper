  "description": "<i>Star Flaws</i> is a humorous text adventure very loosely based on <i>Star Wars</i><br><br>In this tale Nuke Skyporker, Yans Polo and Tobacco the Cookie  set out to destroy the Deaf Star and rescue the princess. <br>\nWhen the game starts it gives the player the option of skipping the screen that outlines the story and to get straight into the game. The tale begins with Luke on the Deaf Star hiding among crates and looking for a way out. <br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well X for EXAMINE. It is also  possible to give instructions to other characters such as 'SAY TO YAN &quot;GO THERE&quot;'<br><br>A successful solution scores 100% <br><br>",
