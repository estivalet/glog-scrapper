  "description": "<i>The Oracle's Cave</i> is an adventure game where you type in various one-letter commands with the keyboard and watch a side-view animation of your actions with the screen scrolling in various directions. You play the role of an adventurer who is trapped at the entrance of a Oracle's cave complex and the only way out is to go through the Oracle's cave on level four within five days. You have the choice of four quests which have you collecting a certain amount of treasures while collecting certain treasures guarded by either The Mummy, The Centaur, The Fiery Dragon, or The Black Knight. <br><br>You have various actions that can be selected and they are move (left, right, up, down and secret passage), rest, use an article, explore surroundings, help and abandon the game. Articles you have on your person include healing items, magic ring (invisibility), rope and key. You also can find weapons to help you when you battle creatures and people and they  are dagger, axe and sword. You start with 12 units of energy and no units of wounds, and other stats you can see are weapons, combat, treasure and articles. There is also a map showing the key areas of most of the rooms are hidden and can only be seen when entered.<br><br>As you move around the caves, this uses up energy and exploring the caves can either help or hinder you and must be used cautiously. You will encounter creatures and people guarding treasures and these can be fought or you can run away. The computer decides the outcome every time you attack and you keep attacking until you run away or you kill it. You can also collect wounds which decreases your energy and if your energy is too low or wounds are too high then you are too weak to carry on and you are transported to a safe cave to recover. Here you can rest and decide how long for in hours like in any part of the cave complex, but remember that you only have five days to complete the game.",
