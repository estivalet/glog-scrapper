  "description": "<i>The Boyd File</i> is a text adventure with the occasional picture.<br><br>This is a detective story set in Hollywood or someplace similar. The player takes the role of Luthor Bailey, a typical down-at-heel private eye who's hired by a John Ford to find his missing sister Betty Boyd. The tone of the game follows the American gumshoe novel throughout, for example the missing woman is described as &quot;...a dame of about twenty-five. She had thick, blond, curly hair and a face that could have been nice with a smile on it.&quot;, and when the game performs an action such as TAKE GUN it often responds with &quot;OK MAC&quot;.<br><br>It was written with the Graphic Adventure Creator and supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W/U/D for North/South/East/West/up and Down. Some areas of the game have to be completed within a set number of moves, if the player takes too many turns then they will find they come to a dead end.<br><br>When completed correctly the player will score 180 points.",
