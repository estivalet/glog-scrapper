  "description": "<i>Diarmid</i> is a two-part text adventure loosely based on one of the great Irish romances, that of  Diarmid and Grainne.<br><br>The story starts around a fireside where an old man tells a story to the assembled company. In this tale Diarmid has fought hard and long in the service of Finn MacCumhal leader of the Fianna. <br><br>Now the war against the dark forces that threatened the land is over and Diarmid is granted leave to return home to Grainne to whom he is betrothed. Listening to this story the player falls asleep and takes the role of Diarmid as he sets forth on his quest.<br><br>In part one, the player learns that Grainne has been carried off by Black MacMoran to The Castle of Mists and set off over The Lost Lands and The Sea Of Serpents to rescue her. At the end of part one the player is given a password that they need to start part two in which you complete the quest.<br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as more advanced commands such as 'SEARCH DUST' and 'GET BOOTS AND WEAR THEM'. RAMSAVE and RAMLOAD commands are available.\n",
