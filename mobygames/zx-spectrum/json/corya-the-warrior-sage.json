  "description": "Corya the Warrior-Sage has just witnessed a dragon destroying the village of Ermahal and although a warrior-sage seldom ventures into the world of men, they will if needed. This land needs the help of Corya to destroy this dragon. The game is a text only adventure with no graphics. The screen describes your surroundings and allows you to type in commands to conquer this adventure. The game is split into three parts. The first part is to equip yourself and explore your surroundings. The second is a rescue and to recover a stolen artifact. The third and final part is to solve problems in a city and to finally confront the dragon.",
