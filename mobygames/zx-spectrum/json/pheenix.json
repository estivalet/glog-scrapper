  "description": "<i>Pheenix</i> is a clone of the arcade shooter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/phoenix_\">Phoenix</a>: In five different screens, you have to shoot various flying entities whose droppings prove harmful for your spaceship. Luckily, you can activate a shield that will protect your vessel for a short time (you can't shoot during that time either though).<br><br>While the five different screens are similar, each one is unique in its way: In the first two you have to shoot bat-like creatures that line up on the screen not unlike in another arcade classic from the era, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/galaxian\">Galaxian</a>. In the third and fourth screen, you first see eggs flying around before birds hatch and start unloading on you. And in the fifth screen, you have to destroy a large, heavily shielded enemy mothership. If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty.<br>\nTo defeat the numerous enemies, your ship is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field.<br><br>If you get hit by an alien or an alien projectile, then you lose one of four lives, once all lives are spent, it is game over.",
