  "description": "<i>Dominoes</i> is an adaptation of the traditional board game where the player competes against one computer opponent. The two players take turns laying domino bricks so that they create a chain of bricks. The bricks are placed so that adjacent numbers match. To win a game the player has to score exactly 72 points. Points are scored when the end dominoes totals a multiple of 3 or 5. So for example if the sum of the bricks is fifteen then the player scores eight points (15/3 + 15/5 = 8). If the sum is not divisible by 3 or 5 then no points will be given. If a player scores higher than 72, the score will be 72 minus the number of points above 72. When the player has used all his bricks a new game is started but the score will be kept. ",
