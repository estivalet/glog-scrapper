  "description": "In <i>NATO Assault Course</i>, one or two players compete in an obstacle course as one of four characters - the Hitman, the Ninja, the Flame, and Tommo. To do this, they must accomplish certain tasks including jumping over brick walls, crawling through pipes, jumping over fire pits, crawl across a tightrope, and using their weapon to fire at targets. The winner is the first one over the finish line. The game includes a course designer that allows players to design their own courses, then compete in them.<br><br>",
