  "description": "<i>Slippery Sid</i> is another implementation of the <i>Snake</i> genre, sharing very similar gameplay. <br><br><i>Sid</i> the snake is the character which the player will control during the game. It is a non-stoppable reptile which has only one focus in mind: to eat all the green frogs present on every screen. To succeed in this task he has to avoid colliding against walls, against his own body and the poisonous toads. <br><br>Every time a frog is eaten, Sid's body will grow larger and a toad will randomly appear on the screen. One of the main difficulties which defines this genre is to manage the perpetual manoeuvring of a body which is in constant growth, and is constrained on a limited scenario dotted with deadly obstacles.    <br><br>Levels will increasingly become more difficult, as the speed of the game will proportionally increase every time a scenario is completed.
