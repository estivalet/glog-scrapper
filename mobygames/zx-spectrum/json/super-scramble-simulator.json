  "description": "Super Scramble Simulator recreates the sport of scrambling/ motorcross, but in a manner similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kikstart\">Kikstart</a> TV show and games. The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits.<br><br>The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.",
