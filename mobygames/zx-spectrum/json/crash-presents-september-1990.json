  "description": "Issue 80 of the Spectrum magazine Crash! came with a cassette containing two previously-released game - platform arcade adventure <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dynamite-dan\">Dynamite Dan</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/luna-atac\">Luna Atac</a>, a platform game which was originally released by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Atlantis\">Atlantis</a>. There's also a batch of cheats, and two exclusive games.<br><br>In Monster Munch, you must travel through 30 side-scrolling levels collecting ingredients for a spell. There are enemies to avoid, energy-boosting potions to collect (watch out for the poisoned ones though).<br><br>Solaris is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up in which you must wipe out aliens from a succession of planets. They come at you in waves up 4 or 5, and can be destroyed with your laser. At the end of each level you receive a points bonus for the amount of lives you have left.",
