  "description": "<i>Kentilla</i> is a text adventure with graphics. It is a sequel to an earlier text adventure by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,149064/\">Derek Brewster</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/velnors-lair\">Velnor's Lair</a>.<br><br>At the end of the previous game, Velnor was vanquished and his soul was hurled through the void into the flames of the Abyss. In the spilt second that the corridor was opened Grako returned from the Abyss and now controls the source of Velnor's power, the Moonstone of Aigrath. The object of the game is to defeat Grako and to return him to the flames of the Abyss. In this the player is aided by the mystical sword Kentilla and companions such as Elva, who can carry things as well as perform tasks and fight.<br><br>The game's text parser, in addition to accepting the normal commands of 'Go North' and 'Get item' allows the player to issue commands to others such as 'Say To Elva &quot;Get Moss&quot;'.<br><br>The game also plays music while the game is in progress.",
