  "description": "Adder Attack is a simple arcade game. The player must collect golden nuggets and avoid deadly snakes. The dangerous lethal blue snake is also trying to collect nuggets; if given the chance, he will eliminate you... but he has valuable opals. Occasionally he drops one and the player can pick it up for an extra 100 points.<br><br>Adder Attack has simple controls, only 4 keys to move. Graphics are 2D, a characteristic of early ZX Spectrum games.",
