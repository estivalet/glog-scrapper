  "description": "Snake Escape is a puzzle game where you control a snake through increasingly difficult mazes, in order to escape and reach the food. It features 38 levels converted from the web game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lime-rick\">Lime Rick</a> (most of them harder than the original version) and a few extra (even harder) new levels. <br><br>Technically, the game includes AY music and it's implemented using the Nirvana+ Engine, which allows the ZX-Spectrum to display full-screen multicolored sprites (i.e. combine more colours than normally possible without colour clash).",
