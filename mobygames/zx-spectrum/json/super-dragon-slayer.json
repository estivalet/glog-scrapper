  "description": "What does a brave magician do when the princess gets kidnapped? Well usually nothing since we have brave knights to save her, but not this time. The mighty dragon is holding a princess captive in his lair and our brave magician must rescue her by battling hordes of evil minions in 4 levels of this almost forgotten game.<br><br>The gameplay is a classical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The enemies come in pre-determined patterns and never attack you directly. They are just there for you to avoid or shoot at. <br><br>Shooting enemies gives you points but also builds up your magic points. When you collect enough magic points you'll get a spell to cast. These spell are really useful and quite fun to use. There is a bomb spell that kills everything on the screen and &quot;frog&quot; spell that lets you jump a large holes. Some spells change depending on the level of the game you're playing.<br><br>Speaking of holes, you must remember that in this game holes are your biggest enemies. Most of the time the trick is finding a right place to jump from. You only have one life, you can get a extra life when you kill enough enemies, but one wrong step and you're in the hole and you're dead. Extra life doesn't count for holes.",
