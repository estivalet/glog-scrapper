  "description": "<i>Alien Research Centre</i> is a graphical text adventure. The player is a spacer, specifically he's a hard-up spacer, who gets a call from Brogan.  Brogan's not hard up, he's rich, he owns a space ship, the Alien Research Centre or A.R.C., and Brogan has a problem. <br><br>One of the A.R.C.'s crew got high on drugs and not only did they sabotage the ship they released a number of deadly creatures. The crew are probably all dead but the ship is still intact and worth a lot of money. Your job is to board her, repair her, reach the bridge and activate the E.H.D. (Emergency Homing Device)<br><br><br>Armed only with a decimator cannon, and anything else they come across, the player must explore the ship, repair it, and return to Earth to collect their bonus.<br><br>This game supports the standard commands such as GET and DROP together with shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West. Other commands such as SHOOT, KILL, STAB, KICK are also needed\n",
