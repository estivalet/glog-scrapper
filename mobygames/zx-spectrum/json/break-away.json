  "description": "<i>Break-Away</i> is a puzzle game In which the object is to score points by freeing the damsel in distress.<br><br>She's held captive by 15 bonds each of which has a letter or a number at each end. \nTo free her the player must enter the correct pair of letters and numbers before the game time expires.\nIt sounds simple but the bonds overlap and many letters and numbers, such as V, W and U, do look alike. In addition the damsel does shout for help at random intervals and this is represented by a large red block with the letters 'HELP!' which effectively hides the bonds making it impossible to trace which bond goes to where.<br><br>As soon as one level is completed there's a brief 'Thank you' message and the player is presented with another screen. With each new screen the player has progressively less time to solve the puzzle.<br><br>The game keeps track of the current score and the best score this session.",
