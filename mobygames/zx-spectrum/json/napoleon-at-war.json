  "description": "<i>Napoleon At War</i> is a turn based strategy game, based on Napoleonic era warfare, more specifically - the Battle of Eylau. The player takes the role of Napoleon and commands his armies against the Russian army under Bennigsen and a Prussian corpse.  Armies have various units - cavalry, artillery and foot soldiers and can be ordered as an entire corps by ordering the lead unit of that corps or as individual divisions. The AI may suggest alternative orders if your orders look suspect. The game has three difficulty settings which determine the adaptability of the computer opponent. ",
