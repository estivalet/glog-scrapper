  "description": "<i>Panic</i> is a timed arcade game, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Panic\">Space Panic</a>. The goal of the player is to clear the board of monsters by digging trap holes and hitting them over the head until they fall down to a lower platform. Red monster dies after one fall, other color monsters (appear after escaping the trap) need to be knocked through two or three platforms respectively to be killed. Points are awarded by killing the monsters and the remaining oxygen (time indicator) at the end of each board. Contact with a monster means an immediate death.",
