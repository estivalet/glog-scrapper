  "description": "<i>Vampire's Empire</i> casts you as Doctor Van Helsing, making another attempt to rid the world of Dracula. The world consists of 160 side-view screens, with others accessed via push-scrolling, but must be freed of vampires within a time limit.<br><br>Van Helsing's method of killing is to use mirrors to reflect his beam of light onto them. He must always keep this under control. Bats and snakes must be avoided, as they cost Van Helsing energy. Coffins must be avoided, as they release nasties which will chase you.",
