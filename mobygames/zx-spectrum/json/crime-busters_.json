  "description": "Bennie the Burglar knows that Slough's elite people will all be at a barbecue this evening, meaning this is his chance to burgle their mansions - if the Crime Busters force can't stop him. <br><br><i>Crime Busters</i> is a platformer with four available opponents (Spy, Copper, Ghost and Maggie), a two-player mode and a practice mode. Bennie must first collect five items from each mansion, then escape by using a trampoline no more than four times. Avoid being captured and thrown in jail, though items to be collected regenerate when you do.",
