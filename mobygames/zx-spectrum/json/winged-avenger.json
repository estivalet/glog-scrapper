  "description": "<i>Winged Avenger</i> is a shooter where you move left or right on the bottom of the screen and shoot at aliens above. The aliens move all over the screen and fire back at you and if you touch an alien or are hit by their bullets then you lose part of your energy which starts at 512. There are seven levels with two types of aliens having to be defeated for three levels each before you face a large ship on level seven. As well as bullets which can be fired either in single shot or rapid, you have a shield which lasts for a limited time. There are seven skill levels (0-6) which increases how fast the game is.",
