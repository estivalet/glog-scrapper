  "description": "Based on the board game, the object is guess a word or phrase based on a drawing. There are five categories - Person/Place/Animal, Object, Action, a category of difficult puzzles, and an All Play category. The amount of time to guess an answer can be altered.<br><br>These drawings are done using a cut-down variant of a paint package, which you can practice with to get your drawing skills up to scratch. You are not limited to freehand drawing - lines, boxes, circles and curves can be drawn, with variable ink colours and line thickness. After each question the game will tell you the answer and ask which player (if any) got the correct answer. Pictionary can be played against the computer, or with multiple players. ",
