  "description": "<i>Samotnik</i> (Peg solitaire) is an adaptation of the Peg Solitaire board game. The game takes place on an European-style peg solitaire board which has 37 squares, all squares occupied by pegs except one, chosen by the player in the beginning. Each move involves the player choosing a peg, then having it jump over another peg in any of four directions, removing the peg jumped over. The game doesn't have a built-in victory condition, but hints that the player may consider it complete when there is only one peg left, or when a pre-determined shape has been arranged. <br><br>The game may be restarted at any time, and colors can be freely changed.
