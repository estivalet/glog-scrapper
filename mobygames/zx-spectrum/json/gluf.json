  "description": "<i>Gluf</i> is a puzzle platform game whereby you guide Gluf the tesla frog across many single-screen platform floor panels in order to power them up and open up a portal to the next level. In order to light up the panels, Gluf must first charge upon the batteries located on each level, all whilst avoiding the various enemies. Each time you light up a panel, Gluf's power cell reduces by one unit and you will need to recharge if it completely drains. Gluf can not jump over enemies or platforms so must take the elevators to move to higher areas or to escape being hit. Some of the panels disintegrate under Gluf when touched a second time, which can both be a help and a hindrance. <br><br>Originally released as a free download by RetroSouls in January 2019, it was commercially released by Bitmap Soft on cassette tape in November 2019.",
