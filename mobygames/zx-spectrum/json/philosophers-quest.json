  "description": "<i>Philosopher's Quest</i> is a single player text adventure.<br><br>The story starts with the player mooching around a junk shop. Somewhere in the back of the shop is an old wand. Its just lying there and, well, what harm could come from giving it a little wave - especially if the shop keeper's back is turned. So that's what happens, the wand gets waved and the player is transported to another shop somewhere inside a cave system. Though alone in the cave the player hears a voice telling them to go and explore, to seek treasure and bring it back to the shop in payment for misuse of the wand.<br>\nSo begins the adventure that will see the player encounter the serpent in the Garden of Eden, the Ancient Mariner, an invalid old lady, a whale and many other strange characters and places.<br><br>",
