  "description": "Chuckman is a bomb disposal expert faced with a 60-screen maze with 8 bombs to neutralise. To do this, he must collect a toolkit, and can only carry one of these at a time. The paths to run along are yellow, and these also feature boots chasing you (these can be trapped in holes if you first collect a spade). There are also holes which can't be passed without a wheelbarrow to repair them, and regular earthquakes destroying parts of the paths. Each maze in generated randomly, and clearing all 8 bombs produces a new maze, with 3 skill levels influencing just how tough these are.",
