  "description": "Eleven <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Track+Field%27\">Track 'N' Field</a> style events are recreated in this joystick-waggling based game. Five are simple running events of different distances ranging from 100 meters to 1500 meters. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Daley+Thompson%27s+Decathlon%27\">Daley Thompson's Decathlon</a> the longer events don't involve a different technique, or different performance measurements, making the 1500m quite tiring. There are also three throwing events (Javelin, Discus and Hammer), and the High / Long / Triple Jump events. Each event has a pre-defined world record to chase.",
