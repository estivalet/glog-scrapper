  "description": "Navigating the fabled River Styx is a three-stage challenge in this arcade game. Initially you must make your way through an arrangement of walls, shooting out spiders as you go, before reaching the back door and opening it. Next, you find yourself in a river, avoiding and shooting piranhas (unlike the other two sections, in this one you travel from right-to-left, rather than left-to-right). Finally, you must pass through the Infernal Regions under the seas, ultimately taking on the Dark One, before repeating all of this with increased difficulty. Losing one of your three lives sends you back to the first section of the difficulty block.",
