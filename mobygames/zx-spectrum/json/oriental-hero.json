The contest is played out over 4 rounds, each of which ends with a fight with a proven champion. The Indian Cobra for 300 points, a war unit for 400, and a Russian Master for 500 are the first 3 big challenges. Eventually you must beat Zerwin the Magician to take the ultimate title of Oriental Hero. The usual range of moves are on offer, with kicks and punches rather than fireball special moves.",
