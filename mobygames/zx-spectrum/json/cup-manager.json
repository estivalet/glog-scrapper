  "description": "<i>Cup Manager</i> is designed to be played by loading your team from <a id=\"d0a3544271f31a597af784ea70ef08349\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Manager\">GTi's previous The Manager</a>, and leading them to cup glory, although you can use the default squad instead. As with the top English teams in the FA Cup, you start off in the third round, and must win 6 rounds to win the title. Between matches you can train your players and call in the physio, as well as adjusting your squad of 15 to have 11 players and 2 substitutes (who can be brought on at half time). <br><br>Tactics play a bigger role in the game than in The Manager, as before each match you are told with of the four main playing styles your opponents are using, and can then choose yours. You must also choose a penalty taker. Matches are played out by telling you which team is in possession, and alerting you to any chances and incidents. In keeping with FA Cup rules at the time, there are no penalty shoot-outs - drawn matches instead result in infinite replays until a winner is found.",
