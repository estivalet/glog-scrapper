  "description": "The mission in <i>Vampire</i> is rather obscure. The player must destroy the evil Count Dracula who is devastating the region. The nightmare scenario will be the castle of this malevolent personage. Throughout 95 horrifying rooms the player will be besieged by Dracula's slaves; try to avoid them and obtain the greater amount of food as possible. If the player reunites the five keys and introduce them in its five corresponding bolts, the player will have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key, the player must find a certain object and fix it in the <i>generator by pedals</i>. If the player does it, the player will be able to jump the enormous pit.<br><br>The second part of the mission consists in opening the six magical counter-windows pressing the suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer and the stake and walk quickly to the superior part of the castle to take the cross. At this moment the player will be teleported to the space to get rid of the final confrontation in which the player will be able to use the laser weapon and the self-propelled knapsack.",
