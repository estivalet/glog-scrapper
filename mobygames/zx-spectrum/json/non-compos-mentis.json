  "description": "The game is an empty checkerboard and a box full of irregular coloured shapes. You can move and rotate the shapes to fit anywhere to the board, and basically you have to fill a set portion of the screen before the timer runs out. It can be said that this is a kind of Tetris - although fairly original.\nThis game was included with Your Sinclair magazine on its magazine covertape.",
