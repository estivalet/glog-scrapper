You have now been promoted from photographer to reporter for the newspaper The Daily Trumpet, and your first assignment is to go to the mysterious Dr Lee's mansion to find out what goes on inside and to see if he has anything to do with strange disappearances. You also find that you cannot remember being here before but it all seems familiar.<br><br><i>Kwah!</i> is a graphic text adventure in the style of a comic book. The screen is split into three parts and the top part has three windows showing pictures and animations of your last three moves and also tells you if any object or person can be seen. The middle part of the screen is a clock, strength meter, how much of the game is completed and arrows showing available exits. The bottom part of the screen allows you to type in commands to interact with your surroundings.<br><br>",
