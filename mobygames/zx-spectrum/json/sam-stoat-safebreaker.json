  "description": "In <i>Sam Stoat: Safebreaker</i>, the titular weasel (previously seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/monty-is-innocent\">Monty Is Innocent</a>), attempts to steal a precious diamond from one of four different houses, each corresponding to a difficulty level. To do so, he must collect a bomb and a match, bring those to the safe to blow it up and finally take the diamond and move to the exit. In his way are various critters to be avoided and he must also take care to prevent his &quot;bloodometer&quot; from running out. Finding a healing elixir in the house can refill it. Additional jewelry lying about the house can be collected for bonus points. Movement between the different sections of the house is done through mouse holes. Inside each hole is a platform sequence, in which Sam must jump across several moving pillars, landing on them when they are at the top or fall to his death.",
