  "description": "<i>X-Out</i> is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Unlike most comparable games (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=R-Type\">R-Type</a>), the game is not set in outer space or even in the air - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater.<br><br>Through five levels, the player has to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. After having completed a level, the player gets to purchase new weapons; instead of simply buying upgrades, it is possible to customize the ship by placing new weapons anywhere on it.",
