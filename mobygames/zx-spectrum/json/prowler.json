  "description": "<i>Prowler</i> sends you deep into space, to Ursa Minor Delta-V, where the Peradusins are on the attack (companies were starting to run out of subtle ways to re-identify Russia; perhaps it's a good job they weren't 'the enemy' for much longer). Fortunately you have at your disposal a Northall Q15 helicopter-jet hybrid, with advanced weaponry, a zoomable radar and strong shields.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Rescue+on+Fractalus\">Rescue on Fractalus</a> is a good guide to what to expect - the action is first-person and depicted in 3D, with hovercrafts and aircraft among your potential targets. There are various game modes including air and ground combat of varying intensity levels, as well as 5 skill levels and full training modes, as well as ten set-piece scenarios.The tactical screen must be used to pick out troublesome sectors and launch advance attacks on them.",
