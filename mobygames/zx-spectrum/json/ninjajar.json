  "description": "<i>Ninjajar!</i> is a 2D platform game that draws inspiration from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world\">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</a>. Ninjajar wants to take a holiday with his girlfriend on the Beaches of Pepinoni, but when he goes to her village he discovers she has been kidnapped by a monkey. He starts the pursuit to find her back.<br><br>The game consists of a large amount of single-screen environments connected horizontally and vertically to offer exploration. There are villages, caves, underwater sequences and so on. Ninjajar does a lot of platforming. He can jump and punch to take out enemies or to destroy blocks, for instance to create a passage or a platform with elements of environment based puzzle-solving. These puzzles also involve levers and there are many secret rooms to be discovered. The game contains several items that have different uses. Ninjajar can pick up these items and they are stored in a &quot;Carry&quot; portion of the screen. A large amount of interaction is possible. He can talk to people and animals, collect coins, read signs, enter shops to buy new items and so on. The game is split up in several levels and a password is providing after completing one. Nine lives are provided at the start of the game.<br><br>The game contains a lot of humour, music and cultural references from properties such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Alex+Kidd\">Alex Kidd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Mario\">Mario</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Donkey+Kony\">Donkey Kony</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Bud+Spencer\">Bud Spencer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Rick+Astley\">Rick Astley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=The+A+Team\">The A Team</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Knight+Rider\">Knight Rider</a>, but also other Mojon Twins games such as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Cheril\">Cheril</a> series.
