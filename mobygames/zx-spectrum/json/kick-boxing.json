  "description": "Take on Mick the Meat Kicker in this martial arts simulation. The game takes place in a garden, with lots of space for combat, and is viewed isometrically. You have 3 levels of kick and 2 levels of punch available to you, each activated by pressing fire with the joystick pushed in the appropriate direction. Making contact will score you points and weaken your opponent's energy bar. Both fighters are shirtless, and can be hard to distinguish in the heat of the action.",
