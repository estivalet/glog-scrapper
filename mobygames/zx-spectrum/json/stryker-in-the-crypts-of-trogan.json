  "description": "As a noble and righteous wizard, you must beat the evil Trogan the Diabolical. This involves travelling through flick-screen <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Switchblade\">Switchblade</a> style environments both above and below ground. Using your sword, you must flatten Trogan's many henchmen, and avoid skeletons. You have limited energy, but can collect top-ups. Tokens to both improve and weaken your weaponry are also scattered throughout.<br><br>The Amstrad version adds a silhouetted backdrop (similar to that in the C64 version) when ran on the Amstrad Plus, making it the only cassette-based game released in the UK to cater to the system.",
