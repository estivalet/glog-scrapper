  "description": "This licensed platform games sets you as Scrappy Doo, with the aim of trekking through four levels to rescue Scooby and Shaggy. As his name suggests, Scrappy is adept at using his fists to vanquish many of these foes. The layout of the castle and the route to it features lots of ladders, ledges and gaps to negotiate. Bonus lives (via Scooby Snacks), invincibility periods and extra points (burgers) are on offer throughout the game. Many of these are in precariously-placed areas that require precise timing and considerable risk to reach.",
