  "description": "<i>Aural Quest</i> is a ZX Spectrum text-based role-playing adventure game written by Mike Turner from Gilsoft in The Quill Adventure Writing System. The game was put as a bonus on the second side of the cassette edition of The Stranglers' music album &quot;Aural Sculpture&quot; and was preceded by a short introduction from band's keyboardist Dave Greenfield. In the game the player was placed in the shoes of The Stranglers' tour manager and was about to collect four parts of a giant ear (which was part of the cover art of the music album). Transporting the bits back to Britain allows you to eventually reconstruct the album's signature sculpture. Many of the clues are provided by bursts of The Stranglers music and lyrics.<br><br>",
