  "description": "A planet has been condemned, and you are an engineer dismantling its mining facilities. It turns out that this decision is correct, as without warning its evacuation is ordered. Unfortunately, this leaves you with a limited amount of time to reach the top of the layers of platforms and ladders.<br><br>There are ladders to climb a level, gaps between ledges which need jumping, and doors which are either opened by local switches, or by colour-coded keys. Enemies fly around, but can be shot, even while you are on ladders.",
