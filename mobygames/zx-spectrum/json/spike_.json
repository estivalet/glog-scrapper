  "description": "Spike wishes to find the fabled Magic Dream Sphere, which will make his every wish come true. As such, he must journey through the mysterious and treacherous caverns of the land of Golden Dreams.<br><br>Gameplay is platform based, in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Manic+Miner\">Manic Miner</a>. Each screen consists of a network of bridges, with precise placement and careful planning usually more important than quick reactions, especially as Spike can't be controlled mid-jump. Keys must be collected and switches toggled en route. Once Spike has retrieved the Orb, he must travel back through the screens with it, ensuring that it remains under his control.",
