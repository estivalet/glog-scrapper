  "shortName": "bomb-jack-ii",
  "description": "Having saved the world in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/bomb-jack\">first game</a>, Bomb Jack is out to collect as much gold as possible, which is lying on a number of ledges. These vary between open and shut - the open ones offer more points, and an extra life is on offer for collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route should take in the open ones in order.<br><br>Gameplay differs from the original, in that Bombjack's movement is no longer free and self-propelled. Instead, he moves flick-style between ledges, so long as one is directly within one of the 4 compass directions. Baddies can be pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's limited energy.",
