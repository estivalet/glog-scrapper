  "description": "Erik: the Phantom of the Opera, the game's plot, is partially based on 1909's Gaston Leroux's novel Le Fantôme de l'Opéra. Erik, the Phantom of the Opera, Christine the opera singer and Raoul her friend from childhood and lover are the three main characters common to the novel and the game, although the stories from both works differ substantially on some parts.<br><br>Christine was kidnapped by Erik and locked in his dungeon located bellow the Opera. Raoul is determined to save her by whatever means so he decides to enter the Theatre by night only armed with a gun. <br><br>Erik: the Phantom of the Opera is a platform game with puzzle elements and takes place inside Paris Opera Theatre and its secret underground cave. To find Christine’s whereabouts Raoul has to first find 6 keys which will unlock 6 different doors located throughout the building, before confronting Erik himself. Every time a key is picked, Raoul's energy is partially restored: it's the only way for him to regain his energy. <br><br>Every step and action the player takes has to be carefully and thoroughly measured because there's only one life and the player's vitality is easily spent. The jumping function is the same as the firing, so if the player wants to shoot he has to be still and up, otherwise he would be jumping. Every action is individual, either the player is jumping or ducking or firing. No combinations are allowed.<br><br>To prevent Raoul from saving Christine, Erik the phantom sabotaged the whole building with a wide variety of supernatural entities and traps, usually coming in clusters, some destructible others indestructible: floating toxic vapours, dropping bombs, ghosts, jumping and rolling skulls, flying and creeping masks, top hats, opened books, falling candlestick and daggers among others.",
