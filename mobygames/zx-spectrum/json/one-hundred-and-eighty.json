  "description": "One of the earliest darts simulations, the game has nine skill levels. Taking a shot involves two stages: First, players watch a cursor move around the board and press Enter to stop it on the desired number. After this, a small representation of the number's section, complete with double, treble and off-the-board areas, is shown - players press enter again to stop this in the desired place. As in real darts, the single-score area is largest, with higher scores being a smaller area to hit. The 'bust' rule is different to a real game of darts: busting loses a score from one dart, not the whole set of three, although it does end the player's turn. Otherwise, rules are the same as the real game - players toss darts at a board of scores, aiming for a score between 501 to zero, finishing with a double or the Bullseye. ",
