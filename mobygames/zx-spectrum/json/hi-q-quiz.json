  "description": "<i>Hi-Q-Quiz</i> is a single screen board game for two to four players who must each throw a dice and move a marker from the centre of the board around the board to answer a variety of questions in four categories. To win the game, a player must answer at least one of each subject depicted by a different colour before going back to the centre and answering a random question. The categories are Science, Sport, History and Geography, and Art and Entertainment and the amount that you have to answer for each category can be selected at the start of the game (1-4). When a question is asked, the player whose question it is has to answer it out loud then tell the computer if the answer was right or wrong.",
