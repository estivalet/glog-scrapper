  "description": "<i>Aura Scope</i> is a fantasy text adventure. <br><br>Old Nub maintains 'The Great Cosmic Wheel' which keeps the forces that control the universe in balance. Then one day things go awry and the Great Wheel spun from its axis. The twelve constellations of the zodiac were shattered with fragments being scattered through space and time. Nub can fix things but to do so he needs a hero to recover the twelve symbols, one for each constellation. <br><br>This game was developed using <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as X for EXAMINE and I for INVENTORY.\n",
