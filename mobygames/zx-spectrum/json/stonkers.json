  "description": "An early attempt at a strategy war game with a loosely fictitious setting, although the game map resembles the coastline of northern Europe. The planning and deploying stage of the battle has been handled for you - your units are all in position and ready to attack or defend. The main factor of the game region is that most of it is covered by a river, with only one bridge, the guarding of which is of huge strategic importance - although there are also different gradients to consider. Two map zooms are provided, one for a wider impression of the area and the other for a close view of the individual units. Information about the progress of the war and individual battles is constantly being provided.",
