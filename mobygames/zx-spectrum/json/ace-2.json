  "description": "A follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=ACE\">ACE</a>. Similar to its predecessor, <i>ACE 2</i> is an oldie head-to-head air combat flight sim set in modern days of aviation. The game has a very strong arcade feel, as all the missions you fly are nondescript or generic. Your plane is also a generic, hypothetical modern fighter, and the goal is to fly different sorties to kill enemy aircraft. Very similar to ACE, except that you can now play a 2-player hotseat game, or solo competition against the computer, in split-screen mode.",
