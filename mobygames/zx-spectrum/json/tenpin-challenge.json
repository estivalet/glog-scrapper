  "description": "<i>Tenpin Challenge</i> was a budget choice for ten-pin bowling enthusiasts to play the game at home. Up to four players can take part, with a choice of five ball weights. The computer does the scoring automatically, taking bonus points for strikes and spares into account. Your high scores can be saved to cassette.<br><br>Taking a shot has three stages. First you must aim the shot  by moving a cursor left and right. then, you must set the spin, by stopping a spinning diagram as it quickly moves through the 360 degrees. Finally you set the pace, by holding down the 'a' key for the right length of time, with no power gauge to guide you. Once this is done you will see the shot outcome, with a split screen showing the ball moving sideways at first, and then towards (and hopefully into) the bunch of pins, which are then moved and replaced as necessary.",
