  "description": "100,000 years ago, the planet Krauze belonged to a race called <i>Deviants</i> and they had conquered the surrounding planets but their thirst for power ended up causing a civil war between themselves. This nearly wiped out the race so the handful of survivors left the planet never to be seen again. Now in the year 5150, the humans have began searching other areas of space for colonisation and chosen the planet Krauze where remnants of the previous occupants can still be seen with ruined cities and monuments. The colony has started to thrive now but recently has been attacked with the source being from a giant asteroid with a Battlestaion belonging to the Deviants. You are part of a team of Starwarriors sent by the colony to plant nuclear devices in the Battlestaion, but the mission has nearly gone wrong with the team wiped out except yourself just as the last device was planted. It is now up to you to prime all the devices and get out of the Battlestaion to save the humans.<br><br>Deviants is a side view flick-screen run 'n gun game with platform elements where you must move around the various screens looking for the nuclear devices to prime. As you run around the Battlestation you will encounter Deviants with your gun which has limited ammo but more can be found and used. If you are touched by a Deviant then you lose part of your energy and when it runs out then it is game over. When you find a nuclear device, the game switches to a puzzle game where you are presented with a row of valves and they all have to be switched on before a timer reaches zero. You press a number which affects a valve but also affects the other valves. If you fail to turn on the device then the carbon unit is terminated and the game is over.",
