  "description": "In <i>Naanas</i> you play as a man who's trying to catch bananas that a naughty monkey is dropping from a canopy, whilst avoiding coconuts which make you lose a life if they hit you. <br><br>You have 3 different movements in all - left, right and jump (this is needed if you miss a banana, as you lose a life if you slip on it). The game is played on a single screen, and you just have to keep going to see how high a score you can get.",
