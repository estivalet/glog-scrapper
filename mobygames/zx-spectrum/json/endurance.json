  "description": "Endurance uses the same basic game system as CRL's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/formula-one\">Formula One</a>, but turns its attention to motorcycle racing. As the title suggests, the six races featured are all lengthy, and include two 24-hour races for your two bikes (each with 2 riders assigned to it) to complete. Before each race you must set the bike up, trading off speed, fuel consumption and safety for the engine, and speed, safety and tyre wear for the chassis; you must also choose one of the 3 tire compounds. Options are selected using a menu-based system, mostly by clicking on words.<br><br>Races are depicted via a side-view of the bikes scrolling past the pit straight, with constant updates as to the race leader and any bike problems. You can instruct your riders as to how aggressively to race, and  must call your bikes in for pitstops to refuel, change tyres and swap riders. As in the previous game these are controlled in real-time by moving the mechanic around.",
