  "description": "The aim of the game is to rescue a girl tied to a stake on one side of the landscape. Starting off from base camp there are many location to be visited and creatures to avoid before she can be set free. <br><br>Doors(looking like two standing stones) can be used to explore the levels further and find the objects you need to collect to save your loved one. You can run, jump along the land and if you fall into the water you don't die. <br><br>The game can be divided into three stages: the jungle, the temple and  the caves. From the caves you will again get into the jungle, but this time on the other side of the cliff.",
