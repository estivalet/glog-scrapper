  "description": "Kung Fu Knights is a 2D arcade game, where the player controls a knight in armor. He goes from left to right, and throws arrows to kill various enemies like other knights, jumping guys or crocodiles. He must also avoid the enemy's arrows (run, jump or stop, depending on the arrow's location and direction). He has 3 lives, and if he loses them, it's game over.",
