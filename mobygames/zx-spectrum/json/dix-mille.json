  "description": "<i>Dix Mille</i> is a dice game for one to six players and the aim is for the first player to get 10,000 points before the other players. Each player throws six dice and they have to remove any scoring dice that are showing. Once the scoring dice have been removed the player decides whether to throw the remaining dice or pass because if no scoring dice appear in the next throw, then any points scored are lost. If no scoring dice appear on the first throw then no points are score and the next player throws. If all six dice are removed during a players go then they can decide whether to throw a new set of six dice and play on or pass. <br><br>The scoring dice are:\n<ul>\n<li>5 - 50 points</li>\n<li>1 - 100 points</li>\n<li>Three 1's - 1000 points</li>\n<li>Three pairs - 1500 points</li>\n<li>123456 - 3000 points</li>\n<li>Three of a kind - 100 x that number</li>\n</ul>",
