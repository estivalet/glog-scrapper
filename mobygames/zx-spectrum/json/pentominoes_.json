  "description": "<i>Pentominoes</i> is a puzzle game based on the geometrical shapes known as polyominoes where each is made up of a number of squares connected edge to edge. Despite the title, the shapes here contain six squares (hexominoes) and not five. There are twelve different shapes that all have to be fitted within a frame without overlapping. Each shape can be rotated and reversed about its horizontal axis and is placed on the board by entering x- and y-coordinates. On a 48K Spectrum there are ten different sets of shapes to choose from but on a 16K machine there is only one.",
