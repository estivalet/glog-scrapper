  "description": "<i>Moonstrike</i> is a vertically scrolling-down sci-fi shoot 'em up game, taking place on the Moon. <br><br>The player is in control of a spaceship capable of breaching the lunar defences, with the ultimate mission to destroy the super weapon. The spaceship is equipped with two different types of fire-power for aerial and terrestrial engagement - blasters and mines. <br><br>Both weapons are triggered by the same key, but bombardment becomes active only when the spaceship's target is moving directly above a lunar base. There are many upgrades for the fire-power of the spaceship which can be acquired when certain targets are destroyed.",
