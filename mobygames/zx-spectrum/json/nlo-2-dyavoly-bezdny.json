  "description": "<i>NLO 2</i> is a sequel to a unofficial remake of <i>UFO: Enemy Unknown</i> for ZX Spectrum. This time, the game deals with the franchise sequel called <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/x-com-terror-from-the-deep\">Terror From The Deep</a></i>, where the alien threat moved from the skies into the depths of the oceans.<br><br>The game stayed pretty much the same in the basic ideas and the graphics - it's a tactical strategy with a global map mode &amp; research. However, there are noticeable changes to the interface and the world map. <br><br>The most important change is that the ground battles became turn-based, as in <i>Terror From The Deep</i>. Air combat has also been changed. This time it's an arcade shooting sequence, where you need to hit the saucer that moves around the screen from a first person view.",
