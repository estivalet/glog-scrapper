  "description": "Video Olimpic is a game with Olympic background where you should take part in some of the most popular athletic events, these include 100 meter dash, hammer throw, long jump and 110 meter hurdles. For completing the game you should take part in each of them in order, and could just pass to the following one by reaching the qualifying mark previously specified. The gameplay follows the same mechanic of Konami's Track &amp; Field, meaning that your actions will involve grades, repeated and quick button presses, etc. ",
