  "description": "<i>Subacuatic Reloaded</i> is the sequel to the 2009 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/subacuatic\">Subacuatic</a>, but is largely a revised version as the gameplay mechanics, graphics and objectives are completely identical. The only difference is that the game complete level design is new to offer the same experience / challenge in a new environment.<br><br>There is a new story to, but the story is not part of the gameplay and is largely used to describe the game online. After the events of the first game archaeologist Ferdinand W. Templeton did not marry his girlfriend and found love in the arms of an affectionate octopus. The octopus was however not entirely read for a deep and serious relationship and when Ferdinand made a move to &quot;consume&quot; their relationship he received a roundhouse kick so hard it made him lose his four treasured artifacts once again. So now he is back at the bottom of the sea, looking to collect them and return to his octopus.",
