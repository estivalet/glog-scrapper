  "description": "The goal is to capture yellow energy pills by rolling a ball over them. The ball heads off around the screen under its own power and you can only control the ball's path by placing and removing gates to deflect its course by 90 degrees. Each screen must be cleared of energy pills before the time limit expires. Watch out for other objects called effectors which may speed up the ball or change its path. The screen designer is simple to use, and self-explanatory.",
