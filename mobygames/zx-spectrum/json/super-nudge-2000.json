  "description": "<i>Super Nudge 2000</i> is a fruit machine simulator for one player.<br><br>The game allows the player 10, 20 or 30 credits to start and when all credits have been used the player can, if their winnings are high enough, enter their name on a high-score table<br><br>The machine has five reels. Reels 1-4 are game reels that spin to provide a winning or losing line. Reel five contains the numbers 0-5 and wt the end of each spin the corresponding number of lights in the SUPERNUDGE feature is lit. When all lights are lit the feature is activated. \nReel five also has a 'SKILL' symbol which, if displayed, causes all unlit lights to flash and the player can activate the SUPERNUDGE feature by pressing the action key when all lights are lit.\nRandomly, after each spin, the game will retain the lit feature lights for the next spin.<br><br>When a winning line is displayed the player must gamble the win for either a higher or lower win. If a higher win is achieved the process is repeated until the player either achieves the maximum win possible or fails to advance.<br><br>\n",
