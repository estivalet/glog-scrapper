  "description": "<i>Krazy Kong</i> is based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a> where you have to move from the bottom of the screen to the top to rescue a Princess held by a giant ape. To move up the screen you have to climb ladders and move along platforms  while avoiding or jumping barrels that roll down the platforms and ladders. There are also stars that move from the bottom of the screen and move upwards and if you touch a barrel or a star then you lose one of three lives. Later levels see moving platforms as well as spikes that shouldn't be landed on.",
