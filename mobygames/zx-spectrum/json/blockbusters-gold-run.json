  "description": "After winning a best-of-three match against an opponent, competitors in the TV quiz <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Blockbusters\">Blockbusters</a> faced a Gold Run for prizes. Like the main game, this took place on a 5x4 grid of interlocked hexagons, each representing a question. Correct answers turn the hexagon to your colour, and incorrect answers turn it to the opposition colour (in this case, black, blocking your path). The big difference is that the questions are multi-word, with GEM perhaps representing Green Eyed Monster. In the early days players could go on to face 5 Gold Runs; in the later years it became 3 (probably because players who'd won so many standard games were more likely to win the big prizes). This home version is built around the same structure, and has 9 skill levels, dictating how much time you have.",
