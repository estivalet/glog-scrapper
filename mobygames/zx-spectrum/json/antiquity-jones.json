  "description": "<i>Antiquity Jones</i> is a platform game where the player, as the titular adventurer, must locate the lost chalice of Koo-Ram Kar hidden deep within a Peruvian jungle. The game was written using AGD (Arcade Game Designer) and consists of over 30 screens to navigate by either jumping or using ropes. The game can be controlled by keyboard or joystick. <br><br>On the way, Jones's energy is constantly falling, and must be periodically replenished by picking up bottles. Close contact with enemies also takes away Jones's energy. The enemies vary from huge wasps, snakes and random rock falls. Once the lost chalice is found, the player must make his way all the way back to the beginning, although Jones's energy no longer falls with time. ",
