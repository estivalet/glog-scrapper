  "description": "This single-screen top-down action puzzler stars Pippo, a cute creature who must change the colour of each square on a screen. There are 32 levels – the concept is that the number of times a square must be stepped on to change it to the right colour starts at one and increases every four levels, but there’s a bug in the game meaning that odd-numbered levels always need one change, and even-numbered levels always need two. The levels are on 6x4 grids, although these include lots of holes, which Pippo must avoid. <br><br>There are also many nasties patrolling the area – some kill him, while others reset any previous colour changes but can be killed on contact (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bobby+Yazz\">The Bobby Yazz Show</a> has a similar design on this element). <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pacman\">Pacman</a>-style power pills temporarily change enemies into harmless springs. The game features a lot of technical effects and hardware tricks, including full-screen numbers using the normally-blank border.",
