  "description": "Ten years ago, the wizard Ashmeard fought the evil Drakon and took his Golden Mask, which allowed Drakon to walk unnoticed amongst men to steal their souls. After his defeat, Drakon fled into the cave of Llindel, taking with him the Falcon staff which gave him and his minions, the shadow demons, their power. Now, the shadow demons walk the land once again and Drakon's power is returning. While Ashmeard fights the demons, he sends Morrack, his apprentice, to find and kill Drakon and retrieve the Falcon staff before Drakon's army can cross the lake.<br><br><i>Demon from the Darkside</i> is an illustrated text adventure, with more than a third of the game's locations being accompanied by a graphic. Each room lists all possible exits and any items that can be acquired, used or manipulated. The text parser accepts simple verb-noun commands.",
