  "description": "<i>Frogrun!</i> is a top view single screen game based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/frogger\">Frogger</a> where you have to get five frogs one at a time from the bottom of the screen to one of five holes at the top of the screen before a timer reaches zero for each frog. You have to cross a busy road with traffic moving across the screen left or right, and cross a river using logs, turtles and crocodiles who are also moving across the screen, before moving into a hole. You are able to move your frog left, right, forwards and backwards as you avoid the various obstacles and if you are hit by any or fall into the water then you lose one of three lives. When you reach a bank halfway there is also a snake that has to be avoided. You are able to use the back of the crocodiles but can't move on to their heads and some turtles move underwater as well.",
