  "description": "After attempting to simulate orienteering with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Forest\">The Forest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Graham+Relph\">Graham Relph</a> takes things a step further by creating a game-world with no fewer than 4 billion locations. <br><br>These are drawn in considerable detail, and viewable from 2 different modes, as you fly (viewed from above) or walk (viewed panoramically). The task is to locate 9 objects, and you do this by flying close enough to one that a beacon is activated, to which will direct you to it. You must then find a patch of clean land to land on, and then get close by walking to it. Occasionally you will encounter robotic bugs to kill.",
