  "description": "<i>The Queen's Footsteps</i> is a text adventure game running on many vintage platforms. The developer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1121613/\">Davide Bucci</a> included a lot of historical facts in this story, based in 1920's Italy.<br><br>The Player's alter-ego is called Emilia Vittorini; she is a 25-year old girl who in August 1904 just came back in Italy from a nine-month archaeological expedition in Egypt. Emilia follows the transport of treasures of the Nefertari's tomb to the Egyptian museum of Turin. By the way, this discovery really happened in 1904 at the Valley of the Queens, in Egypt. When her ferry arrives in Genoa, Emilia has to leave the treasures on a train heading towards Turin. The day after, she finds however that things have not gone as planned.<br><br>The game is divided in four parts. When you complete one of them, you will get a code that allows to immediately jump to the beginning of the next part. Write down that to resume the game in the future. Passwords are important. On some platforms, you can save and load the game (use save and load commands).",
