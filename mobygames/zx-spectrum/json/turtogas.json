The game is played on a single, fixed screen using a top-down view. The player controls professor Masahiro Chiritu who goes to the beach to collect certain objects. However, the beach is swamped with oversized turtles.<br><br>The character can be guided anywhere on the screen using four keys and he needs to collect dots while avoiding the turtles. The professor starts with five lives and when he gets too close to a turtle he is killed right away, losing a life. Once all dots are collected he can continue walking along the beach endlessly.",
