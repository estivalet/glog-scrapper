  "description": "<i>Camelot</i> is a game based on the Arthurian legends where the player controls Arthur Pendragon after he has been banished from Camelot by the Black Knight. The objective is to collect seven items, unlock a secret door to the castle and be crowned king. This is done by acquiring an army of warriors and defeat various enemies (brigands, dragons, magicians etc.) in combat.<br><br>The game is played on a map where the player moves between countries. If a country is occupied by an enemy the player can choose to fight and if victorious it's possible to search for items. Battles are fought automatically and requires having enough warriors to defeat the enemy forces. All activities in the game also consume food based on the size of the army. Both food and warriors can be acquired with gold from bazaars. A healer that offers protection against plague can also be hired as well as a guide which allows the player to retreat from battle without losing warriors. The game is lost if the player runs out of warriors or food. <br><br>Once all items have been collected the player can return to Camelot. To open the secret door it's necessary to figure out the right key combination. It works similarly to Mastermind and the player gets three attempts. Finally, to complete the game the player needs to have enough money to repay a loan.",
