  "description": "A single classical-style pinball table is provided in this simulation. A table editor is also provided —    this allows you to choose a shape for the table and arrange the component parts as you wish. Up to four players can take it in turns, each with five balls in turn. <br><br>Unusually, the default table has multiple flippers at the bottom of the table, as well as some located higher up. Use them to return a ball higher on table and to prevent it being lost at the bottom of the table. Hitting some valuable areas of the table gives you a bonus. Gain as many points as possible to rack up a high score.",
