Wells</a>' novel <i>The War of the Worlds</i>.

The objective is to discover six locations during the six playing days.The locations must be visited in the right order and on the right day, for the player to be able to reach the Martian encampment on the seventh day and thereby complete the game. The locations that need to be visited are featured in the correct order in the musical version of The War of the Worlds.<br><br><i>Jeff Wayne's Video Game Version of The War of the Worlds</i> is an adventure game with graphics. The game is side scrolling and each location consist of a street that the player follows until reaching an end or a crossroad that allows him to move to another location. Interaction with the world is done by entering the following text commands: get, quit, eat, drink, invent, time and status. Movement is done with cursor keys. Occasionally the player will come across Martian fighting machines that he has to run away from as quickly as possible to avoid being killed. Other ways to die include starving and freezing to death. Therefore it's necessary to collect loaves of bread and bottles of wine and find shelter in houses when night falls.",
