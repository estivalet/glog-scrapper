  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/burgertime\">Burger Time</a> clearly influenced this manic arcade action game, in which your task is to make burgers, by collecting the 4 core components in sequence. Chasing you as you do this are two sausages and eggs, contact with which costing you a life. You are armed with a pepper spray, which paralyzes them for a few seconds, but this is limited to five uses per level. When you touch the burger pieces, they drop, and can be used as weapons to stop the pursuing foods. The arrangement of platforms features many ladders, which you must use to chase and dodge the respective ingredients.",
