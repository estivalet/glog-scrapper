  "description": "You have fallen through a time tunnel back to the Year 1000, and the world of the tick. To return to your own time, go to the star with three coloured keys. Beware of the crocodiles.<br><br>And so begins &quot;Tick Land&quot;, a flick screen platform game which was released as part of a tape compilation of Spanish language games. You control a stick figure which may move left, right, or jump using the keys configured at the main menu. The player has to avoid numerous obstacles such as barbed stakes, collapsing bridges, trampolines and miscellaneous monsters, and make it to the exit at the other end of the room. There are also three keys which must be collected before reaching the final screen. If you take too long to complete a screen, a large tick appears and carries you away.<br><br>The player starts with six lives. In two player mode, players alternate each time a life is lost.\n",
