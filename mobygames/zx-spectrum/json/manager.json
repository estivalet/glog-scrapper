  "description": "This straight-to-budget title is a comparatively uncomplicated football management game. You start by choosing one of the 8 teams in the bottom division, and must eventually make them the best club in the country.<br><br>Your squad is restricted to 15 players, who are randomly generated at the start with ability and fitness levels set. Players can be improved through training (which can be set at five different intensity levels - the higher ones add the risk of players being injured in training) and by the physio.<br><br>You can hire up to 3 scouts, each of whom will present a possible transfer target each week, so it can take time for the right players to become available. You can also sign free transfers in any position each week, but these will need considerable training to become adequate. Existing players can be sold on as well. You must gradually upgrade the stadium and consider adding a plastic pitch, while avoiding exceeding your overdraft limit.<br><br>Matches are played out by displaying the current scores in all matches in the division, with the border flashing when there's a goal in your game. Substitutions can be made at half-time.",
