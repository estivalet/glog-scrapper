  "description": "The Cosmic Key has fallen through time and space and landed on Earth. Find it before Skeletor does or Eternia and the universe will suffer.<br><br>This is an adaption of the motion picture <i>Masters of the Universe</i>. You, as He-Man, must find the eight chords to the Cosmic Key. Along the way, you must fight Skeletor's minions. First, you fight in the streets and try to find a chord hidden in the streets. After you enter the scrapyard, you will meet and fight Blade and Karg to the death in a hand to hand beat 'em up to get another key. In Charlie's Electronics Store, you aim your cross-hair to shoot oncoming enemies who guard a chord. Later, make your way to the rooftops and fight a laser battle on a flying disk. After all eight chords are retrieved, go mano-a-mano with Skeletor in the final battle.",
