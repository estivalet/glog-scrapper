  "description": "Gyron is made up of two mazes,  there's the Atrium,  an easier and more linear maze which acts as an introduction to the game and the Necropolis,  which is much more difficult. The object of Necropolis is to find the &quot;Place of Wisdom&quot; hidden somewhere deep within the maze. You control a craft called the &quot;Hedroid&quot;. <br><br>Vector graphics allow for fast forward acceleration or slower more precise movements. Collisions with the maze walls can cause damage to the Hedroid,  collisions at greater speed cause greater damage, too much damage and it's back to square one<br><br>Towers are positioned on top of the maze walls,  they can only shoot in the direction they are facing,  but get in their line of fire and it'll be almost instant death. Shooting the towers from behind can have a variety of effects,  and you'll need to do this to get through the game - the tower can turn,  disappear(possibly re-appear elsewhere) and change the orientation of other towers - this can result in new routes becoming available or perhaps ending up suddenly in the line of fire. Very large and dangerous spheres move in fixed patterns around the maze,  you'll have to time your passage past them carefully as contact results in instant death.  The scanner indicates the maze paths/walls,  position and orientation of towers and the movement of the spheres - shooting towers can have an effect in areas of the maze not covered by the local range of the scanner<br><br>A couple of tactics to avoid the towers line of sight involve using the spheres as cover,  and hugging the wall of the trench at the base of the towers. Both the Atrium and Necropolis mazes have twelve zones - indicated by the colour of the spinning icosahedron.",
