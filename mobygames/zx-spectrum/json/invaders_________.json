  "description": "<i>Invaders</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> clone. The player controls a mobile laser cannon that moves along the bottom of the screen and there are four defense bunkers to hide behind. The objective is to destroy the invading alien army before they get to the Earth. There are five rows of aliens that begin at the top of the screen and continually march left, down, right, down. Occasionally a flying saucer appears, moving along the top of the screen. Shooting it gives extra points. Once a level is cleared, a new one begins at an increased difficulty.",
