  "description": "In Realtime's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3d-starstrike\">previous Starstrike game</a> (not to be confused with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/star-strike\">Star Strike</a>), the evil Outsiders attacked the Federation and had to be forced back. This time, the boot's on the other foot, as the Federation have sent their <i>Starstrike II</i> vehicles in to take them out. Armed with sophisticated computers, lasers and shields, all it needs is a good pilot, such as yourself.<br><br>Twenty-two planets fall under Outsiders control, and each has grid-based defenses which must be taken out, complete with all their command computers and production droids. The planets are split into five groups, each of which can be chosen at the start of the game. <br><br>The combat is intense, and aims to create the likely feel of space combat, with lots of ducking and weaving to set up shots. The game features filled-in graphics, unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Elite\">Elite</a>-esque wireframes of the first game.",
