  "description": "One of the first future sport simulations, Future Games involves five tough events on the surface of the moon. After each event, you have to drive to the next one across potentially hostile terrain using your skimmer.<br><br>The first event involves dodging through the defenses of a hostile computer system, with on-screen arrows guiding your route. The second is a super-charged game of dodge-ball – avoiding plasma spheres that are being fired at you, while the third involves shooting at everything from a target range. The fourth event entails destroying atomic badgers, while the final one involves running away (read ‘joystick-waggling’) from a hungry beast.\n",
