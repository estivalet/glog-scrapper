  "description": "<i>Aztec Assault</i> is the third text adventure based on the continuing war between the &quot;Time Crusaders of Chronos&quot; and forces of the Primal Darkness led by &quot;The Abomination&quot;.<br><br>The previous two games saw first a village in Ireland then a Caribbean island threatened. The game is set in the year 1512 AD and the attack is centred on the ancient city of Tenochtitlan. The demonic attack is fast and the city is very quickly overrun giving &quot;The Abomination&quot; control of the entire Aztec Empire. <br><br>The king, Motecuhzoma, flees. Monsters and demons roam free, killing at will. More importantly, from the Aztec point of view,  regular sacrifice to the gods is unable to continue and without sacrifice  they cannot prevent the coming of &quot;The Fifth Sun&quot;, otherwise known as the end of the world.
