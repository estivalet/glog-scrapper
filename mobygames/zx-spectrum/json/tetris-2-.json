  "description": "Take basic Tetris, add a few refreshing ideas with possibility of 2 players game and you have Tetris 2.<br><br>Menu of the game offers 2 modes - &quot;Normal Tetris&quot; and &quot;Tetris 2&quot;.<br><br>First mode is nothing more than classic tetris. Geometric shapes randomly generated from 7 basic kinds fall from the top to the bottom. The aim is to form these shapes into coherent\nhorizontal 1,2,3 or 4-lines so they will disappear. This mode offer various rates of falling shapes. Also, it's possible to switch on another 7 special kinds of shapes.<br><br>Second mode is much more interesting. There is 99 different rounds prepared. Almost each round is partly filled with some diagram created by particular shapes (which of course increases difficulty of the game). Every round contains objective(s) to complete. 3 kinds of objectives does exist - &quot;Fulfill Your Quota&quot;, &quot;Destroy All Bricks&quot; and &quot;Survive xx Seconds&quot;. If you'll fail, you're advancing to the next round with loss of 1 life. But no worries, each 5th round is bonus and you can obtain extra life. As well as the first mode it's possible to play with 7 basic kinds of shapes or with 7 basic+7 special kinds of shapes.\n",
