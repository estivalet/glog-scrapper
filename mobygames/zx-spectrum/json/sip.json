  "description": "S.I.P is a modern update of the arcade game Make Trax, and a remade version of the 1st release of this game in 1998. <br><br>It takes place on a sci-fi environment, and to survive the player has to avoid walking certain areas of the surfaces which are surrounded by spikes, or touching the creatures present on each level. <br><br>The game only allows the player to jump between platforms via parallel surfaces. When walking, the player's feet will be attached to the respective surface he's in, allowing him to circumvent the platforms.",
