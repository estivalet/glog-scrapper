  "description": "The 16-bit box calls this ‘The Ultimate Challenge’ and they’re not kidding; this flick-screen platform game is one of the toughest you’ll come across. In the 8-bit versions Hercules has some titanic tasks to complete, whilst in the 16-bit versions his daughter Yolanda has been cursed and can only free herself by completing the same tasks.<br><br>Unusually, the game’s dozens of screens are given in a random order, with a different one after you lose each life. You have no weapon with which to harm the various creatures that lurk within. The pace of the enemies is quite hectic, but the real unique feature is that you must keep moving – each platform is set on fire a few seconds after you first touch it. ",
