  "description": "Having drunk too much at the bar and made a fool out of himself, arena cleaner Ludicrus finds that he has been &quot;promoted&quot; to gladiator. In order to once more become a free man, he must beat three opponents: the big Germanic warrior Herr Liss, the femme fatale Bon d'Age and the masked gladiator Bud Vyzr. Ludricrus must stand five rounds against each opponent, or he must face a lion. If the lion wins, it's game over.<br><br>The game is a one-on-one fighting game where Ludicrus is armed with a short knife. Using a combination of button presses and joystick pulling, Ludicrus may back off, jump, take cover and slash with his knife. There is limited horizontal scrolling as in <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Streetfighter+II\">Streetfighter II</a></i>. Since there are no power bars, you have to hold a mental score of how much damage you have taken and given. Graphics are cartoony with a touch of <i>Astérix</i>.",
