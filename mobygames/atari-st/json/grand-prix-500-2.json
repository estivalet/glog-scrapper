  "description": "You can choose between 4 bikes, 12 tracks (including favourites like Brno, Suzuka and Spa), with 1 or 2 players in this Grand Prix motorcycle racing simulation. You can play a full season including qualifying modes, a single race, or simply practice a circuit to learn it and master the controls. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lotus-esprit-turbo-challenge\">the first Lotus game</a> the game always uses a split screen; in one-player mode the top half of the screen displays the track map.",
