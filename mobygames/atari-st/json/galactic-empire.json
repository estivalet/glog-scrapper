  "description": "In this game you have to roam the space with your spaceship to conquer the universe. Progressing from one star system to another you'll discover new planets (friendly or hostile), engaging in space combat or conversation with other characters to further the plot. You are free to travel to wherever you please, but here the plot is much more linear, and you can't do much without running into the next event that triggers a plot advance. <br><br>",
