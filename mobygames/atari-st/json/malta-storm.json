  "description": "Malta Storm is an simulation of the battle for the Mediterranean that took place between December 1941 and August 1942. It's a turn based war game that's entirely text based. Each turn is three weeks long and for each you'll have to make decisions on both strategic and operational plans. In the strategic part you set up priorities, and in the operational part you give orders to the different groups. After a turn you'll get intelligence to help you with your strategies. You can play as both axis and allies. ",
