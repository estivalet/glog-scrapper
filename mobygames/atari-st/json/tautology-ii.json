  "description": "<em>Tautology II</em> is an enhanced version of the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tautology\">Tautology</a> released one year earlier. In terms of gameplay both games play identical and feature the same modes for single player and multi player games. So, still the board have to be cleaned by connecting identical stones or stones from the same set, with a maximum of two edges in this connection.<br><br>The successor differs in terms of game options and convenience. The user interface is more accessible, mouse and keyboard controls are added to joystick and joypad control, there are new graphical tiles, and more options are available than in the predecessor. Time limits and the amount of available help calls can be configured for each player, allowing a more interesting multi-player game if the skill of the players is very different. In single player mode you progress in levels after clearing a board, getting more difficult boards in the next higher level.<br><br>A high-score table is present. The game runs in High-color mode on the Atari Falcon.",
