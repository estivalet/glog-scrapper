  "description": "<i>From Little Acorns</i> is a humorous adventure game that takes place in the next dimension. It is a day like any other, you are waiting for your friend Alvin so you can go drinking at the Amputated Goblin. The player and Alvin are both professional adventurers. In the inn the player hears about a new quest from the government: Return the country to sanity and a decent economic footing. Without much thinking Alvin accepts the quest, it's just collecting a lot of valuable loot and bring it to the chancellor, how hard could it be? When the game starts the player is hopelessly drunk at the Amputated Goblin inn. So the first thing the player has to do before beginning the seemingly easy quest is to sober up.<br><br>A the top of the screen the player sees the score, number of moves done and direction buttons (W,N,S,E). In the middle there is a picture of the current location, at the bottom of the screen there is a text window for text descriptions and to the right is the command window where the player can select commands to execute (Take, drop, etc).",
