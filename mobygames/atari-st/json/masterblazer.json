  "description": "<i>Masterblazer</i> is both a remake of and a follow-up to the Lucasfilm Games game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ballblazer\">Ballblazer</a>.<br><br>Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called &quot;Rotofoils&quot;. The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called &quot;Plasmorb&quot; into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple: &quot;Three minutes, two players, one victor!&quot; The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.<br><br>Compared to <i>Ballblazer</i>, <i>Masterblazer</i> offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.",
