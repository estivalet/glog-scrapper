Once on the surface, he must complete 5 survival boot camps and become the Legion-Command Officer or die trying.<br><br>A sidescrolling action-adventure developed by WJS Design and published by Psygnosis (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Shadow+of+the+Beast\">Shadow of the Beast</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/leander\">Leander</a>), <i>Ork</i> features five expansive levels characteristic of Psygnosis games of the era. While slightly similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/killing-game-show\">the same firm's earlier Killing Game Show</a>, Ork's presentation is more polished, and the gameplay is less hectic. <br><br>In addition to blasting enemies, the player must complete tasks reminiscent of adventure games. Examples including locating and delivering a payment to a gate keeper, finding a specific key to open a door, or locating an orb to deflect lasers.",
