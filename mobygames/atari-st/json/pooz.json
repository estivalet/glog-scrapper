  "description": "<em>Pooz</em> is a puzzle game with several playing modes. You control a small guy in the middle of the screen and are only able to move in a small 4x4 area. Pills are constantly appearing at the outside and moving towards the centre. The pills are colored in four colors, while the player itself is also having a color. Pointing to a pill with the same color in the direction of the player, the pill disappears. If the pill is having a different color, the pill is colored in the color of the player and the player gains the next of the four colors. <br><br>The different playing modes are &quot;Continual&quot;, in which the pills approach from an empty board. With certain amount of points, the next level is reached and the pills appearing in shorter time intervals. If a pill stack reaches the centre, the game is over. In &quot;Level&quot; mode you can decide yourself how fast the pills appear and how many fill the screen on the beginning. Finally &quot;Time Attack&quot; is starting with a completely filled board and you have to remove a certain amount of pills in a given time without any pills added.<br><br>Three two-player modes are available in which you either play as team, or against each other or in a mode in a &quot;Combo&quot; mode. Team play is like &quot;Continual&quot; mode in single player mode. Playing against each other, one player can only remove pills at the top and bottom, while the other has access to left and right pills. If a pill is removed, it appears in the opponents area!<br><br>With success you unlock cards, and a high-score table keeps track of your success.",
