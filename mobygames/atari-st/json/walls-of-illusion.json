  "description": "Walls of Illusion is an RPG similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dungeon-master\">Dungeon Master</a> and other dungeon crawlers. Your party of four starts with nothing. No weapons, no armour and no spells. So you must collect these before engaging in combat. Since the enemies are superior the use of tactics becomes more important. You will come across a lots of traps and other obstacles during your journey through the dungeon. Like normal in role playing games you gain experience for defeating your enemies and after awhile you will get to a new level.",
