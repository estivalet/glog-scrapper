  "description": "<i>Leonid</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> clone in high resolution for one player written in GFA Basic.<br><br>At the main menu the player may select whether they want to play with pieces consisting of four or five blocks, which level setup they would prefer (there are eight to choose from), and how fast the pieces should drop.<br><br>The main game screen is divided into three parts: the actual Tetris game is to the left, the score and such things are in the middle, and to the right is a picture of Leonid Brezhnev (other communist leaders may also appear). Every block has a circle on it that marks the point of rotation.<br><br>Players can use the mouse to shoot at the blocks to make them disappear or at the picture of Brezhnev. Shooting at the picture gets players extra bonus points, but shooting at blocks decreases their score.",
