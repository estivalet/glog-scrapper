  "description": "<i>Snakes &amp; Ladders</i> is a computer implementation of the board game with the same name. Try to be the first to reach the finish line, use ladders to take shortcuts across the game board but watch out for snakes, they will move you backwards. This game has the peculiarity that two game pieces can not occupy the same square, so that the second player to reach a occupied square will end up one square behind it.<br><br>The game was written in GFA Basic.",
