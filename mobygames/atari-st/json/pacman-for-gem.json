  "description": "Pacman for GEM is a conversion of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">classic arcade game</a> running in a window on the GEM desktop. Like the arcade version, and unlike most home versions, the playfield has a vertical orientation. It is no straight conversion, however, with all levels being new (and creatable by users) and the number of ghosts on-screen being variable. Ten levels are contained in the standard distribution. While the standard look mimics the original Pac-Man, the tilesets are user-creatable, in the form of standard ST resource files. Another sample tileset comes with the game. Steering is handled via keyboard, and the game is system-friendly, running on anything from an old ST (low-res screens are too small to fit the standard tileset, though) to powerful 68060-based clones and with both standard TOS and replacement operating systems.",
