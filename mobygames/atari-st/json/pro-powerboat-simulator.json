  "shortName": "pro-powerboat-simulator",
  "description": "If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.<br><br>As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.\n",
