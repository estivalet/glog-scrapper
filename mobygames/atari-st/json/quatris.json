  "description": "<i>Quatris</i> is a puzzle game for one player coded in STOS.<br><br>The aim of the game is to stop the quats from filling the play-room. A quat is a square block and it can be of one of four different types. The quats falls into the play-room in groups of four (arranged as a square) and they can be destroyed in two different ways: either by forming a 2x2 box of similar quats or by forming a line of at least four similar quats (lines may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal). Forming lines gives more points. <br><br>The game ends when the time runs out, or when the play-room gets totally flooded with quats.",
