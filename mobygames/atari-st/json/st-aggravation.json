  "description": "<i>ST Aggravation</i> is a board game for up to six players.\nThe aim of the game is to get all of the players marbles from base (the solid color circles outside of the path) to home (the outlined colored circles inside the path) To start moving a marble a player needs to roll a one or a six. If a player rolls a six and can't use that six he/she gets a new roll. Marbles may be passed on the game board as long as they are not your own. if a player lands on a light blue circle that player may take a short-cut directly over the board the next turn. If a player happens to land on another players marble that marble is said to be captured and is sent back to the base.",
