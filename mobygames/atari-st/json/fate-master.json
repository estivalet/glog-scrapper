  "description": "On the planet Tafoi a war broke out: the Swocki ambushed the local Galluks, wiping most of the population. They are led by the Phenocles, an evil god. And, being a god, this is also a threat to the Alliance, which rules the galaxy. To get a picture of the situation, the Alliance decided to bring in an agent first before starting direct military intervention on Tafoi. <br><br>In <em>Fate Master</em> the player controls commander Tsin-Fei to gather information and preferably solving the situation on the planet without military strike. In the flip-screen landscape the commander can discover and collect items, enter doors, and approach enemies. On contact with enemies the game flips to a fighting screen, in which the player can attack or flee. On attack, one of the equipped weapons like pistols or grenades, can be used and in turns the player and the enemy attack until one of the fighters run out of hitpoints. Defeating an enemy is rewarded with gold, which can be used at a vendors to buy new or better weapons. The character has four stats: hitpoints, strength, skill and defence, which are automatically increased if the player reached a new level. On re-entering a room, previously killed enemies respawned.<br><br>NPCs give the player quests, like finding a person or special items, reaching certain places, in which often certain items are involved (like you need dynamite to open a blocked door). Games can be loaded and saved.",
