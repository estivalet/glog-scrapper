  "description": "<i>Make a break</i> is a quiz game with a touch of snooker. In each turn the player first needs to select a ball to pot (selecting subject) and then answer the supplied question within the time limit. For each questions the player is presented with four answer options. The number of points that the player gains from a correct answer depends on the color of the ball selected. Selecting the wrong answer means game over. The various subjects are: TV+Films, the past, the world, music, sport, sci + nature, the arts and pot luck.\n",
