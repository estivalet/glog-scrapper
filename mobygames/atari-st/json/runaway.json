  "description": "<i>Runaway</i> is a action game written in 68000 assembler. You have to guide a small drone ship through the tunnels of the moon. Due to a power drive control system failure the ship cannot slow down. You have plenty of fuel but you have to be careful so that you don't crash into the walls. You have six tries to save the drone ship. A sort of radar map on the right side of the screen shows you how far it is to safety.",
