  "description": "<i>Crystal Caverns</i> is a platform game coded in STOS. The aim of the game is to find three crystals hidden in a cave the size of 120 screens. Once you find a crystal you have to take it to its proper place and you can only carry one crystal at a time. The cave is filled with monsters. At some locations you can find magic spells that can aid you in your quest. You have to be careful when exploring the caves because you got only one life and there are many monsters lurking down there. The game is controlled by joystick.",
