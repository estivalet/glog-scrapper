  "description": "<i>World Soccer</i> is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player is responsible for the financial and athletic success of a soccer team. The world soccer league is the home of the best teams of Europe and the player takes over a team from the 3rd division; the goal being to become the number one in the long run. <br><br>The game is mostly menu based in which the player can visit the medical station, the transfer market (available athletes are searched by a scout), the bank for a loan and of course the lineup for the next match. Each athlete has a few statistics which should be taken into account.\nDuring the matches the player can't intervene besides substitutions in the half-time. The player can watch the highlights of the match; either with animations in the 16-bit versions or as text in the 8-bit version. Alternatively only the results can be shown.",
