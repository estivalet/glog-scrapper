  "description": "Dreams are made by The Dreamtrack Corporation, a group of evil subliminal-messengers whose intention is to destroy the minds of the minority of people capable of interpreting other people's dreams and live them out through entertainment. That's the story in this distinctly Cyberpunk-inspired title, and you play Chad, the man who discovers this secret, and aims to put an end to it.<br><br>Your task on each level is to clear a path for Kaf-E, your girlfriend, to be able to progress to the heart of the Dreamtrack HQ, getting past each of the myriad of security systems they have built up. A map must be used to navigate the route through the systems, with lots of information readily available.<br><br>The basic gameplay sees you darting through 3D tunnels using the mouse, and is like a prototype <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Descent%27\">Descent</a>, with your ship kitted out with cannons and missiles, with each enemy better dealt with by one or the other.<br><br>As well as ensuring your own survival, you must guide Kaf-E through the levels by blasting out the correct sections to clear a path for her. As she has no intelligence, and simply walks into walls, this element can be compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lemmings%27\">Lemmings</a>.",
