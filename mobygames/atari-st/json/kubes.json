  "description": "<i>Kubes</i> is a puzzle game written in STOS where you have to arrange falling blocks of similar colors into groups. When you get a vertical or horizontal group it will disappear and you get some points. When the blocks reaches the top of the game area it's game over. Before the game starts you may select which level to start on and how many blocks a group has to have before it disappears. You can not move individual blocks but you can move whole rows; move the marker to the row you want to move and then use the keys to move that row to the left or right.",
