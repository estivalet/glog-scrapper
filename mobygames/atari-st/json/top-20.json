  "description": "As a manager of a music band, the goal in <em>Top 20</em> is to create a number one hit in the charts. You can hire musicians, create demo tapes, organize radio gigs, recording a long player and finally create a music video. The game is basically played with a dice and on a board with fields of different types, but this board is not shown by the game, only hints given when moving are given. The game is basically divided in two phases: first set up a band and create a recording, then try to climb up in the charts.<br><br>After rolling the dice and moving on the boards events happen according the the field entered. There are different kind of cards, some giving you benefits like a demo tape or you can exchange members of your band. Your band members have different styles of music they can play, like Jazz, Oldies or New Wave. Having the desired amount of members able to play a certain style, the band is playing this kind of music. With event cards, you can exchange the members of the band. Random events occur during the rounds, when sometimes a groupie destroyed your demo tape or somebody spend some money to the band.<br><br>Having created a demo tape, a recording in the studio and visited a radio show, you can start to play gigs raising some money. The band can even send on a world tour.<br><br>The game is in German language only and written in GFA Basic, the source code is included in the package.",
