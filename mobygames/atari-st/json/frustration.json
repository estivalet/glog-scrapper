  "description": "<i>Frustration</i> is a two player word search game in high resolution.<br><br>Each player, in turn, tries to create words from a random combination of letters spread over an 11x11 grid. How many point you get for a word depends on how long it is (the longer the better), you must also have created the word within the time limit or you will score zero points in that turn. Each game lets you build 10 words. Words can only be constructed from adjacent letters and each letter square may only be used once per word.<br><br>The game has three difficulty levels. At the easies level you have 99 second to build a single word and it may have a length of 1 to 11 letters. At the normal level you have 50 seconds to build a single word which has to have at least 3 letters in it. At the hardest level you have 25 seconds to construct a word with at least 4 letters in it. Words may only be used once per game and singular and plural are counted as different words.",
