  "description": "<i>Chichén Itzá</i> is a Spanish text-adventure, the final chapter of the <i>Ci-U-Than</i> trilogy of games. They all utilize the parser DAAD, that has capabilities similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Infocom\">Infocom</a> Z-machine one (you can chain commands, correct misspellings, etc). This time the main quest is divided in two parts: In the first half you have to satisfy all the gods demands while exploring the ruined temple and solving its mystery. In the last part you journey from hell to heaven in an effort to liberate the god Kukulkán from his prison.",
