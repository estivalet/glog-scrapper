The game uses a graphical mouse based interface where the cursor is used to to pick up chips and place them on the board before clicking on the dice to roll. The player then either makes or loses money and the game continues with more rounds until money runs out. The starting amount of money is $1000 and when out of money the player gets the option to either borrow another $1000 or quit the game.",
