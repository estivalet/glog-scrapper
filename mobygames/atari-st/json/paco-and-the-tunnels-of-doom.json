  "description": "Paco has become stranded on the planet Mineoes and since he is broke he has to collect gems to afford the ticket home. In each level there is a certain number of gems you have to collect before an exit opens up at the bottom of the screen and you can move on to the next level (collecting all the gems will earn you bonus points). If you discover that you can't collect the gems needed and you can climb up to the surface again you can restart the level without losing a life.  As the player digs through the levels care must be taken so that he or she doesn't get caught in a hole that Paco can't climb up from (Paco can only climb upwards if he has dirt or brick walls on both sides of him). <br><br>The game is written in STOS and comes with a level editor.",
