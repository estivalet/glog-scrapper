  "description": "<i>Super Scramble</i> is a clone of Konami's Scramble with a few differences. As in the original game the player flies a space ship through a cave system filled with missiles that launch from the ground. But unlike the original game the player has to battle an end of level boss in the form of a space snake after each level (6 in total) except after the last level when the player has to battle the evil darklord himself. The ship is armed with a forward mounted gun and laser bombs. At the top of the screen the player can see number of lives left, score and fuel status. The player has to destroy fuel drums to keep his ship supplied with fuel.<br><br>The background story is that the evil darklord Zargor has conquered the galaxy and that their are only a couple of thousand humans left. They have created a spaceship named Cobra so powerful that it can destroy the darklord himself and it is of course the players task to pilot this powerful ship.<br><br>The game was created using STOS.",
