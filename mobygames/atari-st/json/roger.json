  "description": "In <em>Roger</em> you control a small ball with feet and a red glasses and your aim is to collect all diamonds in a levels. But those crystals are spread across the area, which scrolls smoothly in eight directions: to reach those, you have to utilize platforms, but also rely on &quot;jumping bubbles&quot;. Touching those bubbles, you are accelerated and shot a small way up in the air, reaching further diamonds or the next jumping bubble. The bubbles disappear after contact, but respawn short time after that, so you can reach upper parts of the level again. There are metal spike blobs in the level, which have to be avoided, as they drain some energy from Roger, but crash on contact too. Two special items can be found: extra energy and extra time. The last one is required, as the levels feature a strict time limit. If either time or energy reaches zero, one of the initial three lives is lost.<br><br>After finishing a level bonus points for the remaining time is rewarded. A high-score table can be reached. On the game start, a trainer can be activated, enabling unlimited lives and disabling the time limit on the levels.",
