  "description": "<i>Football Genius</i> is a football quiz game with an extra football twist. First the player chooses his/hers team. Then the computer sets up the tournament. The game then plays out in the following fashion: a question with four possible answers is asked and the player has to choose an answer. Depending on how long it took and if it's the right answer a line will either move up or down a football field on  the right hand side of the screen. A match will last for 2x90 seconds. If the line reaches one of the goals it is goal and a point will be given to the team that succeeded.<br><br>The goal of the game is to stay in the tournament and win the final.",
