  "description": "<i>Cameleon98</i> is a freeware remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7-colors\">7 Colors</a>, created as an entry for the Disccover 1998 coding competition in Finland. Instead of the seven colors of the original, the palette was reduced to only four to make the gameplay faster and more casual. The objective remains the same, where two players take turns picking tiles on a multi-colored grid, to advance and expand territory. The space already conquered by each player becomes the color of the chosen tile, automatically adding any other square of the same tone touching its perimeter.<br><br>There's only support for single-play against a computer opponent, with several settings available on the options menu, changing the artificial intelligence to use one of six different strategies, switching parameters in the field generation to make it more or less random, and modifying the size of the board between four grid configurations.",
