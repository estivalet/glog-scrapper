  "description": "<i>Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ishar-legend-of-the-fortress\">Ishar: Legend of the Fortress</a>.<br><br>Following the defeat of Krogh and the banishment of the powers of chaos, Ishar became a cultural and intellectual centre in Kendoria. Over time people came to the island and settled there. A city named Zach's Island developed and flourished. Shandar, a monk of chaos, entered the city along with settlers from the northern lands. His trading in hallucinogens soon made him rich and powerful. Eventually Shandar controlled Zach's Island and had many followers and worshippers. He built a strong fortress, a second Ishar, to challenge the empire. The warrior Zubaran has a vision that sends him on the quest to defeat Shandar and save his homeland.<br><br>The gameplay system is similar to that of the predecessor and includes exploration of 3D outdoor areas, towns, and dungeons, party management and real-time combat. In the sequel the player can import saved characters from <i>Ishar</i>, or recruit characters to join Zubaran on the quest. The game world includes dungeons, tree-cities, mountain paths with real graded height effect. <br><br>Unlike the first game, there is a day and night cycle in <i>Messengers of Doom</i>. Shops are closed during the day, and medieval nightclubs are open only at night. The game world is considerably larger than in the previous game. Other new features include the ability to use pet animals as allies in battles, and create magic potions.",
