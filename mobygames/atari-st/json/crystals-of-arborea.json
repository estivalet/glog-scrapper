  "description": "Mogroth, the deity of chaos, was enraged by the gods' decision to banish him from the pantheon. Plotting revenge, he began poisoning the minds of the nations of the world. Black elves and orcs became his minions. The gods flooded the land in response, secluding the island kingdom of Arborea as the last stronghold against Mogroth's forces. Jarel, the last Prince of the elf-like race of Sham-nirs, must find allies who would help him on his quest to obtain four elemental crystals, restore the power of the temples, and defeat Mogroth.<br><br><i>Crystals of Arborea</i> is an RPG which is a precursor to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Ishar\">Ishar</a> games. The party of six characters roam the world (on a 2D map or by exploring 3D individual locations), defeating Mogroth's minions, gathering experience points and becoming stronger. Unlike the subsequent <i>Ishar</i> games, combat in this game is turn-based, and takes place on separate screens. The players must manually navigate party members on the battle field. Archers and spellcasters can use ranged attacks, while melee fighters must stand close to the enemy in order to strike. ",
