  "description": "Set around 200BC to 200AD, Cohort II give you the opportunity to set up battles between Roman armies of varying size and type, between warring races of barbarians, or to pit a Roman army and barbarian horde against each other.  Over two dozen scenarios are provided (with the separate Scenario Cards) for those wishing to &quot;draw their swords&quot; immediately into a challenging battle.  Your computer opponent has a variety of different tactics at its disposal, and will vary them depending on how the battle progresses.  So even if you play the same scenario again and again, it won't be the same game twice.",
