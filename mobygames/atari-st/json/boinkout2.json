  "description": "<em>BoinkOut2</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a> conversion. The player controls a bat at the lower border of the screen and has to bound a ball flying around to crush all stones in a level. If the ball passes the lower border, a life is lost.<br><br>The paddle is controlled with the mouse and unlike the original game, the paddle can also be moved vertically in a small range. A high-score table keeps track of your success. The game runs with any color depth (from monochrome up to 256 colors).",
