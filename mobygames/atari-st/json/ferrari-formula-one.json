  "description": "With the full support of Scuderia Ferrari, Formula One racing was recreated in detail in this simulation, with the top drivers and teams of 1986 to compete against for the most successful F1 team of all. You job does not start at the racetrack; perfecting the car at the Maranello factory, in the wind tunnel to sort aerodynamics, and at the test track of Fiorano, is all required to get the most competitive car you can.<br><br>You can jump straight into the races however, either as one-offs or a full championship season. Races can last from 18km to the full 300+km distance, with all the practice and qualifying sessions. Car setup at the track involves selecting wing settings, tyre compounds, fuel usage (important in the days of turbocharged engines) and the like. The action is viewed from inside the cockpit, with rear-view mirrors to help prevent collisions.",
