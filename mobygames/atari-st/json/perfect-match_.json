  "description": "<i>Perfect Match</i> is an educational game that mixes the gameplay of a concentration/memory game with the questions of a trivia game. The player is presented with a set of cards with each having a sentence on the hidden side. The task is to flip two cards to reveal their statements. When doing so the player will be asked if they match and if they do and the player answers yes the cards will be removed from the table and points will be earned. Answering wrong will lead to a loss of points. The game can be played by up to four players at a time and the player with the highest score when all cards have been removed wins the game. <br><br>There are ten different question sets to play with as well as one with mixed questions. In addition to those there is an editor that allows the player to create new question sets for use in the game. ",
