  "description": "<i>European Superleague</i> is a managerial soccer simulation which is about an fictional European league featuring eight of the most successful teams (PSV Eindhoven, Glasgow Rangers, Liverpool, Arsenal, Real Madrid, Olympique de Marseilles, AC Milan and Bayern Munich). The player takes control over one of those clubs and is responsible for its athletic and financial success. The player has all the usual options available, including tactics, lineup, transfer market or training. A speciality is the weekly board meeting in which the chairman gives his opinion on the team's current stand. Each team has 20 athletes with abilities which influence their performance during the match (no graphical representation). The game is completely menu-based and the sub-menus are reached through the main menu which has a different graphical or text presentation depending on the used platform.",
