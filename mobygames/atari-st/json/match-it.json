  "description": "<i>Match It</i> is a tile matching game written in 68000 assembler. \nMatch all the tiles in the level to move on to the next level. Tiles can only be matched if a line with at most two corners can be drawn between them. There are two types of special tiles: flowers and seasons removing two flowers or season tiles will stop the game timer for some seconds. If you get stuck you have two help options you can use by pressing the help-key. If you complete a level without using any of the help options you will be given one extra as a bonus. Unused help options will be added to the score at the end of the game. The game runs on time and when the time is up it's game over.<br><br>The game comes bundled with its source code.",
