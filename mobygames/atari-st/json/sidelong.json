  "description": "In <i>Sidelong</i> the player is piloting back a ship to the repair pool when a message is received telling the player that an alien ship has been detected within the base and that a bomb has detonated close to the main reactor. The bomb blast damaged the reactor so severe that it will go critical in just minutes. The player must now escape the underground base but the ship is damaged in such a way that there is no break. Luckily the ship is armed with a powerful laser that can obliterate solid rock. However the laser must be used with care since it consumes fuel. The player have infinite lives, but the amount of fuel is limited (and not reset when the player dies) and the time to reactor meltdown is steadily decreasing.\n",
