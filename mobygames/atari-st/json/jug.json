  "description": "The planet Spiraeus is dying from an unknown virus that has infected its living core. A lone hero, a shape-shifting metallic-organic hybrid creature nicknamed &quot;Jug&quot;, is tasked with saving it, reaching into the depths of the planet and facing the hostiles that have infested it.<br><br><em>Jug</em> is a non-linear side-viewed shoot'em up that scrolls in all directions. The player's goal is to reach the exit of each level, negotiating its maze-like structure and respawning enemies. By morphing into different ships, the Jug can avail itself of three firing modes: standard gun, laser and smart bomb. The Jug can hover in the air, however this consumes fuel, which can be replenished by staying on the ground. Parts of the level must be unlocked by collecting special items that remove barriers. Other power-ups will improve the Jug's firing modes, add smart bombs or replenish fuel and shields.<br><br>The game features a hot-seat two-player mode, however each player must complete their own levels independently of the other player's progress.",
