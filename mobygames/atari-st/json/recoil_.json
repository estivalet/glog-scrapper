  "description": "The universe is under attack (again). On EMAR II, home of some rare energy crystals, an alien fleet stopped by. Defence is reduced to a single turret gun named &quot;Kiss My Ass&quot;.<br><br><em>Recoil</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/defender\">Defender</a> clone. You control the ship and can scroll to both left and right by turning your ship into the desired direction. A huge radar map on the bottom of the screen show enemy activities. In the game, there is a twist on the original scheme: your ship is mounted on some building on the top of the screen and therefore constantly rising back to the top of the screen, which makes control a bit more challenging.<br><br>The goal is to destroy any moving enemy, while collecting energy and bringing those energy crystals to your base. You have three lives initially and can release a smart bomb as emergency exit.",
