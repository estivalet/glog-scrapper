  "description": "Set in between the SSI's AD&amp;D Dragonlance action games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/gameId,3601\">Heroes of the Lance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/gameId,1868\">Shadow Sorcerer</a>. This game follows the tradition of Heroes of the Lance with a side-scrolling, action-oriented view, a breakaway from the standard GoldBox RPGs.  Plot-wise, it also takes place between those two games, following closely the novel/game modules written by Weiss/Hickman.<br><br>You take control of one character at a time, with each hero having different abilities.",
