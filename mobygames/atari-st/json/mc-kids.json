Go across various lands and meet McDonald's characters as you travel to places like Ronald's Clubhouse, Birdie's Treehouse, and the Hamburglar's Hideout as you collect Ronald's cards.  <br><br>To kill the many animal enemies you will find, you must collect bricks and throw them. In some sections you will travel along water in a dinghy; also watch for moving platforms and bonus sections, The game features seven different worlds with over 30 main levels and nine bonus levels.",
