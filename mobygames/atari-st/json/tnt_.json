You are all alone and have to fight against the enemy soldiers who keep appearing from almost everywhere. <br><br>You will fight through the marshes, the tropical forest &amp; the clearing by the temple to attempt to prevent you from reaching your goal - to reach the base at Khe Sanh and free the soldiers from the enemy.",
