  "description": "Football coin-op conversion. Large sprites and small playing field. Passing is not important as the main emphasis is on winning the ball and running with it. Very difficult to keep hold of the ball when you are in possession as the opposition defenders have a lot more pace than the player with the ball so games tend to be a melee in the middle of the field of players all frantically tackling each other for possession.",
