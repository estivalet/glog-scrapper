  "description": "<i>Dennis &amp; Denise</i> is a platform game written in STOS.<br><br>Denise has been kidnapped by Mr X. and her wealthy dad has put up a large reward for her return. Dennis, who is heavily in debt, decides to rescue Denise so that he can get his hands on the reward. You have to guide Dennis through six levels consisting of five screens each. On your way through the level you have to watch out for spikes, guns and other traps and you also have to move fast since there is a time-limit for each screen. Several bonus items are spread out throughout the levels, these can for example contain money, teleport you or freeze you.",
