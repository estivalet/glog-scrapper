  "description": "<i>Nil Dieu Vivant</i> (also known as <i>Day of the Pharaoh</i>) is an action-oriented strategy game set in ancient Egypt.<br><br>You start as a descendant of the Pharaoh who was exiled from his kingdom. Your mission is to return to Cairo and claim the throne that is your birthright. You have to prove your worth to the people of Egypt by conquering neighboring lands and defending your kingdom from attack.<br><br>You can make offerings to various Egyptian gods in hopes of divine aid, marry a bride to ensure that your line will continue if you fall in battle, wage wars with neighboring countries, and so on. To construct the various buildings, you will need to find different types. Your starting city will not have all the raw materials available, so you will be forced to conquer your neighbors early on.<br><br>Combat takes place action-style. You will ride in a royal chariot, shooting arrows at the invaders who will throw lances at you. Divine favors, when they are granted, can result in complete annihilation of your enemies, but those are very rare and depend mostly on luck. ",
