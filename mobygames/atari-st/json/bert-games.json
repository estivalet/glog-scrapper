  "description": "Bert bought the helicopter of Ralph and modified it. The player somehow has a gun and is heading for the park to shoot the helicopter. Two years later, Bert takes revenge by attacking Earth with the help of a mad scientist. In <em>Bert Games</em>, the story does not matter.<br><br>The game is consisting of two arcade games. The helicopter part is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/vs-duck-hunt\">Duck Hunt</a>, in which you point to the helicopter and shoot. The cross-hair is controlled with the mouse. On hitting the helicopter it crashes to the ground. You should avoid the falling helicopter to hit Bert, who is standing in the lower right corner. If it hits Bert, the game is over. After using all your munition and Bert being still alive, the game is switching to the second part.<br><br>In Bert's revenge for destroying his helicopter, he attacks Earth with laser weapons which must be defended in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/missile-command_\">Missile Command</a> clone. With the mouse you can drop bombs which destroy any laser beam in that area. If the attacking beams reach the town, you loose energy. The game ends if you have no ammunition or energy left.<br><br>The game has a high-score table and is only running on the high-res monochrome monitor. All the in-game texts are written in German.",
