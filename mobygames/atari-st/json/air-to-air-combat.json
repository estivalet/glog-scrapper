  "description": "<i>Air to Air Combat</i> is a two-player dogfight game. The game area is one screen in size and if a player exits the screen to the left or right he/she will appear again on the opposite side. Since this is a dogfight, the aim of the game is to destroy your opponent before he/she destroys you, and the first to score five kills wins. Sometimes barrage balloons appears and shooting them decreases your opponents score by one. Gravity can be turned on (default) or off. With gravity on one must make sure to always have enough speed not to stall or crash. Flying too high will make you plane engine stall because of lack of oxygen.",
