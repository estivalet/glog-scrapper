  "shortName": "battle-master",
  "description": "An early squad based combat strategy game set in a medieval style fantasy world.<br><br>The player decides which race they want to play (Human, Orc, Dwarf or Elf) each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is then a matter of clearing out areas of opponents and finding items to enhance your character's and companions abilities. <br><br>There are many traps to avoid and death is a constant in what most people would find a very tough game. <br><br>The nearest game to compare it to would be <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rage-of-mages\">Rage Of Mages</a>, though that has more of an RPG/RTT (real-time tactics) focus as opposed to &quot;squad action&quot;, but it does bear aesthetic similarities and a squad based fantasy fighting theme.<br><br>Gameplay for leader is action-oriented, with a menu that allows to Parley/Travel/Rally Troops, change formations or use items.\nThe leader attacks with Melee and Projectile buttons. Some classes are more reliant on teammates than others. &quot;Parley&quot; allows you to buy (but not sell) items, or buy a Safe Pass (skip the area)",
