  "description": "Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/strider\">original</a>, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Switchblade\">Switchblade</a> games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.",
