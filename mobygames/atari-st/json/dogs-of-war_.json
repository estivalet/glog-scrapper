  "description": "Dogs of War sets you as a freelance mercenary soldier available to take on a range of missions. These include rescuing kidnapped children, preventing terrorists from overthrowing a Government, and retrieving stolen oil paintings. The amount of money on offer for each mission depends on its difficulty.<br><br>Gameplay is influenced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Commando%27\">Commando</a>, with levels scrolling in a single direction at a time and featuring hordes of enemies moving towards you. Buildings and trees offer positions to hide behind, and occasionally launch safe attacks. <br><br>Before each mission you must buy your range of weapons and enough ammunition for them. These include pistols, machine guns, anti-tank devices and grenade launchers, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses detailed.",
