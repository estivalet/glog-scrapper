  "description": "You are supposed to take your girlfriend to the Live Aid rock concert tonight; unfortunately, thieves have stolen and dismantled your motorcycle. You realise this at 3pm, and must find and reassemble all the parts in order to arrive at your girl's home by 7.30pm. Fail, and she will go with the loathsome John instead.<br><br>The game is a time-limited adventure, in which you must walk through the mean city streets, by directing the player sprite into, out of and across the screen. When you meet people you are told of their physique and job, and can interrogate them about your bike (resulting in set dialogues), run away, or fight. This results in a one-on-one beat 'em up element, with punches, kicks and a headbutt available. Your strength is represented by a glass of beer going from full to empty - when it's empty you are dead. There is a bar in which to recharge your energy (the dangers of riding a motorcycle after drinking alcohol have not been incorporated into this logic).",
