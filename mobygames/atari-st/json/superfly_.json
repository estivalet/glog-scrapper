  "description": "<i>SuperFly</i> is an extremely, extremely simple game. Or at least its controls are. Your task is to fly a vehicle at a steady pace through a scrolling cave system, with your only method of input being a single button. Press the button to give your vessel lift, release it and gravity will do its work. At all times, you must avoid crashing into the top and bottom of the cave, and avoid the obstacles which appear a screen apart. It is all rather similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dragonwing\">Dragonwing</a>.<br><br>To spice things up, <i>SuperFly</i> has everything a modern game must have (save for complex controls and 3D graphics). It has different game modes, different vessels, a system of experience points to lock up new areas and modes, a picture gallery, a jukebox and even a gamma setting.<br><br>As you start out the game with zero experience, you can only &quot;fly&quot; your submarine in the most basic game mode, Freeflight. Here, you only fly on for as long as you can handle, amassing points until you luck up the next mode; Starsearch. Now, your object is to pick up a specified number of stars while flying through the caves. After that comes the Stage mode, which is like Freeflight, only you fly towards a goal, which is farther and farther removed the more stages you complete. The Hunter mode is like Freeflight but with stars added, but here the goal is to simply collect as many as possible instead of a set number.<br><br>The final mode to be unlocked is the Story mode. Through introductory pictures between the stages, it tells the story of our hero, Dr. James Snuggles who must go all the way to the moon to save his girlfriend Kylie. You start out in your submarine as usual, until you reach your helicopter. Fly the helicopter between the clouds, and you might reach the spaceship. After that, you put on jetboots and fly like Superman to save Kylie. All these vessels (and boots) are eventually locked up for use in all modes.",
