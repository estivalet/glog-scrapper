  "description": "<i>Sex Olympics</i> marks fictitious sci-fi porn star <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Brad+Stallion+series\">Brad Stallion</a>'s final huzzah.  This adventure game has a mouse-driven interface that allows players to click on objects in order to solve puzzles, including the use of some &quot;specialised&quot; actions related to sex.<br><br>The game takes place in a fictional universe where the player controls dashing hero Brad Stallion, in competition with arch-enemy Dr. Dildo in the interplanetary Sex Olympics. The goal of this futuristic sporting event is to seduce women (more precisely, nubile females of various species) from different planets faster than the lothario Dr. Dildo does. This is achieved either by seducing them through old-fashioned questing and the solution of adventure-game puzzles or by thwarting the good doctor from obtaining certain items he needs in order to keep his groove on.",
