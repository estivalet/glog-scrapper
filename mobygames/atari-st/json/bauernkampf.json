  "description": "<em>Bauernkampf</em> (english: pawn fight) is a small board game played on a 5x5 board. On the upper side there are five computer controlled pawns, while on the lower side two player controlled knights are standing. Movement of the figures is like in the chess games: pawns can move one or two fields first and capture other figures diagonal only. The knights can move two fields forward and one field to the side (in any direction).<br><br>The goal of the player is to prevent that any of the pawns reaches the lower border. There are no scores or time limits, but the overall match history is shown. The game is written in GFA Basic and the source code is coming with the game.",
