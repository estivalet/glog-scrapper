  "description": "<i>The Dark Wars</i> is an RPG that takes place in a large secluded clearing in the Invar forest where four towns lies. Clerics had long believed that there  was something  outside this clearing but other people rejected this as fairytale stories. But when one day contact was lost with the two southern towns some people started to wonder if there was any truth in what the clerics believed. Now war broke out between the two remaining cities, Swordsblade and Eaglesmount and the situation looked very grim for Eaglesmount. But the one night the Swordsblade army got almost annihilated, survivors told the citizens of Eaglesmount that an army of evil orcs from the south had attacked them. After the two towns agreed to cease the fighting an expedition was sent south to discover what had happened to the two towns south of the Invar river. For many weeks nothing is heard from the expedition but then one day a lonely soldier stumbles into Swordsblade and utter the word &quot;undead&quot; before he dies. In his possession a note is found that warns the two towns of a great evil to the south and forbids anyone to travel south of the Invar river. The elders ignores this warning and a reward of 20000 bronze pieces is offered to anyone that can find out what is happening to the south and this is where the player comes into the picture. As a poor adventurer living in Eaglesmount you accept the challenge and get ready.<br><br>Before starting to play you need to generate a character; choose between four races: human,  elf,  dwarf  or halfling and between four classes: warrior,  magic user or  thief. After you've generated your character you start the adventure in the easternmost town Eaglesmount. You now have to gain experience, level up, find other adventurers that want to join you in your quest and, when you are strong enough, journey south and cross the river to discover what evil lurks there. Traveling alone you won't get far so it is important to speak to other adventurers and try to convince them to join you.<br><br>The game was written in GFA Basic V2.0.",
