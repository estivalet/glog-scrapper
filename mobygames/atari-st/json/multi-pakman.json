  "description": "<i>Multi Pakman</i> is a multiplayer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> clone. Two players (or one and the computer) competes for the highest score. The game features three kinds of special items: score bonuses, the question mark and death. If you run across a question mark you may get one of several different bonuses, such as reversed joystick controls or extra points. If you run across the death item you lose a life. If the time runs out before the lives runs out it's on to the next level and the same thing happens if all the dots are eaten. Once it's game over you get to see player statistics and the high score table.",
