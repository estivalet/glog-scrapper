  "description": "From Finland, the land of cave-flyers, comes a two-player caveflying game called <i>Utopos</i>. In a split-screen view, you and a mate control a small rocket in a cramped cave system filled with traps, trying to hunt each other down. Each player starts out on his starting ramp (of which there in fact are several), which is also armed with an anti-aircraft gun that may be rotated at will as long as the rocket is on the ground.<br><br>In addition to the one-on-one two-player mode, there is a &quot;race&quot; mode where the two players race around the screen, passing checkpoints along the way.<br><br>For a single player, there is a &quot;seek and destroy&quot; mode, where all enemies on a level must be destroyed, upon which a port to the next level is opened.<br><br>To make the game more long-lasting, there are several levels to fly around, and an assortment of different bombs and projectiles to arm the ships with, as well as an afterburner that can be installed in place of a weapon.",
