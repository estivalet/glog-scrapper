  "description": "<i>Projekt Prometheus</i> is a German text adventure with graphics. It is set in 2012 directly after the explosion of a nuclear plant. The only way to get rid of the radioactivity is to fetch a resource only available in space. Unfortunately the whole crew of the space ship was killed by a plague and only one man, a journalist, remains. He has to figure out the space ship controls and solve puzzles, e.g. dealing with a contaminated command console.<br><br>The player communicates with the game by typing in commands with the keyboard and reading the game's text descriptions. However, the player can associate often used orders to the function keys. The icon bar, controlled with the mouse, offers additional functions or notifications, e.g. a compass which is used to leave a room, switching between text and graphics (not available for all rooms) or a mini map of the space ship.",
