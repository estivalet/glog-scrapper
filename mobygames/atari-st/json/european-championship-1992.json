  "description": "Tecmo's <i>World Cup '90</i> arcade game was remodeled based on the 1992 European Championships for its home computer release. The tournament's structure of the time (2 groups of 4 play each other once, top 2 go through to semi-finals followed by a final) is recreated, with any of Europe's soccer nations available to be chosen as those 8, and 1 or 2 human players choosing their team, playing on either keyboard or joystick.<br><br>The matches are played from a side-scrolling perspective. The ball sticks to the player's foot, and can be kicked or passed with a press of the fire button. The referee is fairly lenient when it comes to tough sliding tackles, although fierce contact will result in a free kick being given.",
