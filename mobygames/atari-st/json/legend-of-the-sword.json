  "description": "The evil sorcerer Suzar and his army of mutated humanoids attacked the land of Anar and defeated its bravest warriors in a bloody battle. You were the only one who was able to escape. You were picked up by a royal merchant ship and brought to the king Darius. The people of Anar know the ancient legends, that tells about magical sword and shield, whose power alone is able to defeat Suzar. You and five other adventurers have volunteered to venture into the wilderness of Anar and to retrieve the magical items.<br><br><i>Legend of the Sword</i> is a fantasy adventure game with very slight RPG elements (top-down view, day and night cycle, world map exploration, traditional RPG-like plot, etc.). But the core gameplay is that of a pure puzzle-solving adventure. You interact with the environment by typing commands, and only a few of them are represented by icons (movement in eight directions as well as going in and out).",
