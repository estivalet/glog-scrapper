  "description": "This second part of the BAT series takes place in ROMA 2, the most important city of the planet Shedishan. The United Galaxies Organization has contacted the &quot;Bureau of Astral Troubleshooters (BAT) in order to investigate the murder of a BAT agent named Sylvia Hatford who tried to uncover the businesses of a mysterious dealer of important raw materials. You are playing the second agent, Jehan Menais, now involved in the dangerous investigations.<br><br>The game itself is a mixture between graphics adventure, space combat simulator and strategy game. The adventure part is realized in a classic 2D point-and-click environment, the space combat can be best described as a small version of Firebird's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Elite\">Elite</a>, and the various small arcade games included can either be played in a strategic mode or an arcade mode where your reaction skills are required.",
