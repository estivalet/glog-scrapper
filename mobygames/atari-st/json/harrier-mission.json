  "description": "Is anyone better placed to write a simulation of a Jump Jet than someone who flies them for a living? With any luck, no - Vaughan Dow is behind this attempt at an accurate recreation of his day job.<br><br>You can take on one of four statuses, from Flight Lieutenant right up to Group Captain, with a practice mode also included. You must use guidance missiles and close-range guns, while paying attention to your fuel level, and the wind on higher difficulties.",
