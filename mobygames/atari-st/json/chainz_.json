  "description": "<em>Chainz</em> (not to be confused with the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/chainz\">Chainz</a> of the same name) is a puzzle game, converting the browser game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Browser\">Chain-reaction</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,237117/\">Andrea Gilbert</a>.<br><br>On a 3x3 board there are symbols in different shapes and colors. You can connect two symbols if they share the same color or the same shape. Each symbol is only allowed to touched once, but you can connect two fields even if there is a symbol between them. But no diagonal connections are allowed, only horizontal and vertical jumps are possible. The game features 22 levels of increasing difficulty (later more forms and colors are added). There is no save game option so the player has to restart from level one in each game.",
