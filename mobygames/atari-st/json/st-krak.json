  "description": "<i>ST Krak</i> is a colorful break-out game for one player.<br><br>Every level has two passages at the upper part of the screen, one to the left and one to the right. If there is an arrow here you can use the passage to go to the next (right) or previous (left) level. You can of course also advance to the next level the usual way; by eliminating all removable bricks from the level. Certain bricks give special bonuses, such as black ones which enables your ball to cut through the bricks like a hot knife cuts butter. If you take too long to complete a level a thing will appear and start to move around the screen; every tile it touches will be altered. <br><br>A level editor enables the player to create his/her own levels.",
