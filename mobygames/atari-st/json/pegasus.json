  "description": "In this game, an evil demon called Satan has spread chaos in the world, and someone has to stop him. This is where you come in. \nPlaying as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). \nA friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.<br><br>Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.<br><br>You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.<br><br>After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.<br><br>",
