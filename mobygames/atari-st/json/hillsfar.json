Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!<br><br><i>Hillsfar</i> is a single-hero role-playing game (as opposed to other <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> role-playing games, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of first person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and third person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.\nhttps://www.mobygames.com/images/continue-arrow.gif\nAs a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: fighter, thief, cleric, or magic-user. Each class to a certain extent, have different assigned quests given by each respective guild.<br><br>In <i>Hillsfar</i>, gameplay usually consists of various mini-games that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master. These mini-games (and their viewpoints) include:\n<ul>\n<li>Fighting in the arena (third person).\n<li>Competing at the archery range (first person).\n<li>Exploring buildings or mazes (top-down).\n<li>Riding a horse outside Hillsfar while avoiding obstacles (third person/side-scrolling).\n<li>Locking picking doors and chests (first person).\n</ul>\nUnlike most role-playing games, there aren't any randomly generated monsters to battle. In <i>Hillsfar</i>, combat only occurs in the arena.",
