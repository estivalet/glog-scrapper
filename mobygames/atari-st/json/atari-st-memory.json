  "description": "<em>Memory</em> is an implementation of the board game of the same name. 60 cards are placed randomly in a rectangular grid on the board. Each symbol is included in the cards twice. The goal is to find as many pairs of symbols as possible. Each turn, a player is allowed to turn two symbols, and if they do not match, turn them face down again. If the opened cards a a pair of the same symbol, the player is rewarded a point and is allowed to turn another two cards.<br><br>The game features four different symbol sets, a default set with abstract symbols, one with company logos, one with numbers and one set called &quot;Profi&quot; (professional) which even more abstract symbols. The game is played against a computer AI. The strength of the computer can be set in steps between 0 to 100, which is the percentage of how many cards the computer can memorise. On 100%, the computer knows any card ever turned, which makes winning nearly impossible.<br><br>A high-score table can be reached and is persisted to disk.",
