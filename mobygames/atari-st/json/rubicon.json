The player must trek through seven levels inhabited by mutated super-intelligent animals in order to diffuse each nuclear reactor.<br><br>Gameplay is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/contra\">Gryzor</a> style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter (with occasional jetpack flights), with fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which the player will have to control in order to gain the weapon they want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Project+X\">Project X</a> which was released at a similar time.",
