  "description": "Gravon is a spiritual predecessor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-flashpoint-cold-war-crisis\">Operation Flashpoint</a>. The player controls a hovercraft on a mission to fight enemies on a planetary belt. While controlling the hovercraft the player has to keep in mind the physical laws such as action and reaction or gravity. Breaks are required often if the player want to move without problems.<br><br>There are multiple missions in which the player has to fulfill a task such as find a quest objective or destroy something. It is not always known upfront where the target is located and so the player has to search for it on a large map. There are multiple types of enemies such as enemy hovercrafts, tanks, helicopters etc. These enemies can be destroyed using the hovercraft cannon.<br><br>The maps are very large and procedurally generated. Players can find multiple objects on those. Those include villages, oil refineries, civilian ships etc. The environment differs as the terrain can be grassland, desert or winter landscapes.",
