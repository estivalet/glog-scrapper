  "description": "<i>Trolls</i> is a kind of maze game coded in 68000 assembler.<br><br>Little Billy is always fantasizing and day-dreaming. It has gone so far that he even has forgot his friends and family. To teach him a lesson a spirit has zapped him into a world of fantasy and danger. You have to guide Billy through 9 levels so that he may escape the fantasy world. Every level is filled with traps and trolls will chase you.<br><br>To avoid traps you have to keep an eye on the &quot;Trap meter&quot; on the right side of the screen, this will tell you if you are close to a trap (but not where it is). To see the traps you have to collect and use magic pebbles. The exit is located at the top of each maze. Since it's a fantasy world you have infinite lives.",
