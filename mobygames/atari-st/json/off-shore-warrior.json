  "description": "Society has become ultra-peaceful, but some retain a lust for violence and carnage. Off-shore racing fills that void perfectly in this behind-the-boat racer, which resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Titus\">Titus</a>'s earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fire-and-forget\">Fire & Forget</a>.<br><br>Four X1 boats armed with missiles tough it out over circuits set up in lakes and lined with rocks, desperately trying to avoid finishing last, as this will eliminate them from future competition. Contact with other boats can also be harmful, and will cost you time.",
