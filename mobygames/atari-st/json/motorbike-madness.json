  "description": "Motorbike Madness views downhill racing from an isometric <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marble-madness\">Marble Madness</a>-influenced perspective. You must reach the bottom within the time limit, remaining within the track boundaries and avoiding hazards including water, logs and stationary cars. The faster you complete the course, the more prize money you receive. Repairs to any damage to the bike (incurred by contact with the aforementioned hazards) must be paid for from this, but the rest can be spent on upgrades. The controls are rotational, with the fire button or space used for wheelies.",
