Enemy guns are set either behind the indestructible borders or in free positions. All of them are shooting at you in certain directions. Flying on a scrolling playscreen, you may move in four directions and shoot\ntowards you. You should avoid the enemy bullets and blocking structures to do not to be killed. The bosses appear in certain parts, where screen-scrolling mode stops until the boss will be eliminated.<br><br>On your way 12 saving points will mark the positions, from where you'll restart after losing one of your lives. You should keep your energy level, shooting certain energy cells to increase it. Also you should shoot a combination of four letters &quot;FIRE&quot; to upgrade your weapon to 2nd level, or 4 items of square to add some kind of missiles for you possession.<br><br>Finishing your way after 12th saving point, you'll be transferred to the initial starting position with all points, energy, and missiles, but without weapon upgrade.",
