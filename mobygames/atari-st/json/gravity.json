  "description": "Gravity is an isometric-perspective action game whose gameplay centers around maneuvering a spaceship around a three-dimensional isometric grid in an attempt to colonise planets. Centers of gravity create &quot;pits&quot; on that grid, which are the basic obstacles to maneuver around.\nAn alien species called &quot;Outies&quot; plans on transforming all suns of the galaxy into black holes. They feed off raw energy, and as black holes are a good source of that, they attempt to create as many as possible of them. The player is sent out in a scout ship to colonise worlds in an attempt to gain resources to use for battling the Outies.",
