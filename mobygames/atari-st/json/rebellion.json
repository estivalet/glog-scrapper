  "description": "<i>Rebellion</i> is a top down viewed shoot 'em up with multi-directional movement. In each of the game's single screen levels the player's task is to save a number of humans that have been captured by robots. The player enters each level from a drop ship and has to rescue the humans by simple moving up to them and touching them and then leading them back to the drop ship. At the same time numerous robots have to be destroyed but while doing so it's important to avoid killing the humans by mistake.<br><br>Each level has its own quota of humans that have to be saved and it has to be done within a time limit. There are numerous different robots with differences in pace, armour and weapons. Some power ups can be picked up such as shields, extra lives, invisibility and various new weaponry like rockets. At some locations there are fences that have to be destroyed and doors that have to be unlocked. There are also trap doors that have to be avoided.",
