  "description": "Don't you hate it when your favorite TV show gets cancelled?  Prime Time from First Row Software lets you <b><i>be</i></b> the moron who cancels all of the intelligent but low-rated TV shows in favor of popular pseudo-dramatic tripe and identical sitcoms.  Take on the duties of a TV network executive in this highly unusual simulation game.  Pick the shows you want to air, from 160 regular programs and 15 network specials.  Plan a schedule, recruit advertisers, bump shows around optimal time slots, but whatever you do, keep the ratings high if you want to keep your job.\n",
