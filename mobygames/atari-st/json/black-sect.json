  "description": "<i>Black Sect</i> is a point-and-click adventure game based on the 1990 French CPC title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=La+secte+noire\">La secte noire</a>. It shares the original premise of a sect stealing a book of spells, but it is now set in England in the Yorkshire Moors instead of a French village in the Dordogne. The game is not a remake as everything except for the basic premise is new and different from the original title. The player's character needs to get the book back using exploration and by solving puzzles. The entire control system using icons with the mouse is also new, as the original title used text input.",
