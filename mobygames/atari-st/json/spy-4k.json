The binary size of the complete game including graphics and music data is exactly 4096 bytes, therefore the appendix &quot;4k&quot; in the game title.<br><br>The play-field is an 18x18 sized board. Each field contains a number or a bomb. Moving on a field with a number, the players avatar is automatically moving the amount of fields further like stated on the field (e.g. entering a field with a &quot;4&quot;, four additional fields are crossed). The goal is to move a specific amount of fields without moving on a bomb or reaching a board border without having all the moves finished. Having reached the specified amount of moves of a level, the next level with higher requirement of moves is starting.",
