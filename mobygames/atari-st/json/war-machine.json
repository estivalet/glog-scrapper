  "description": "Only you can save the world from destruction, by finding four parts of the weapon to use against the Alien Syndicate's evil leader. This task must be completed within 80 minutes, although you have five lives available.<br><br>Gameplay mainly involves propelling your jumpsuit-backed and powerfully-armed character through the levels, destroying the alien forces as he goes. The levels have lots of pieces of ledges and spikes all around, which must be planned around, as well as lava pits. There is extra weaponry and ammunition to collect along the way. Your main weapon can be fired in any direction, but you can't move and fire at the same time unless you're firing to the left or right.",
