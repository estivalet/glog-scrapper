  "description": "Although a platform game with a decidedly cute look, Car-Vup has little in common with others of the time. The clue as to why is in the titular pun - although you don't carve anything up as such.<br><br>You're at the controls of a car across a landscape made up of colourless girders, and your task is to drive over each of these in turn, which colours them in. By default, upon reaching the end of each platform you turn around, but you can jump across the gap by pressing fire. There are enemies to avoid contact with; these follow pre-programmed movement paths.\n",
