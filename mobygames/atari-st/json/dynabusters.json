To win you have to survive until all other players are dead. You can only die from the fire of a bomb. Sometimes items can appear under stones destroyed by bombs. At the beginning of the game you can place one bomb and it has a range of two squares, both bombs and their range can be increased by collecting power-up's. Skull power-up's have negative effects that lasts for about a minute, bottles causes the same effects as the skulls but only lasts for 20 seconds. Picking up a clock power-up will cease any negative effects immediately. The game comes with several level layouts.",
