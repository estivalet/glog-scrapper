  "shortName": "blood-money",
  "description": "The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - &quot;the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?&quot;<br><br>The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.<br><br>The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.",
