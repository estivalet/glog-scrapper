  "description": "<em>Tautology</em> is an enhanced conversion of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/match-it\">Match it</a>. On a 16x6 board different symbols are shown. Two symbols can be removed if a connection between them has only two corners. From most symbols there are four of the same, some special symbols can be interconnected with each other (like the seasons stones in Mahjong).<br><br>The original game is extended by offering a lot of options: there are two different tile sets, the player can specify which stones should be in the set, time limit can be turned on and off, and there is a two player mode. In the two player mode each player has it's own board on the screen. There are two modes, &quot;Separate&quot; and &quot;Competitive&quot;. In the first, both players are simply clearing their boards, while in the competitive mode the faster player wins a round.<br><br>The game runs in Truecolor mode (Falcon only).",
