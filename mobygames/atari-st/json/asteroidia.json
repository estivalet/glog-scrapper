  "description": "<i>Asteroidia</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a> clone for one player. You start with five lives and gain one extra for every 20.000 points collected. You earn points by destroying as many asteroids as possible.<br><br>Instead of having a one screen game area with wrapping edges you can travel as far as you want in any direction without ever leaving the game area. Now and then alien ships will appear and they will shoot at you or chase you. Asteroids can give you between 50 and 200 points. Some times bonus items such as the shield restorer or the space guy (gives 1000 points if collected) can appear.",
