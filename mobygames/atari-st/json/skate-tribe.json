  "description": "Skate Tribe was coming third in Mandarin's 1989 „Gameswriter of The Year“ contest, in which the producer of STOS wanted the best games created with their tool and promised commercial publication. The result was published on the compilation <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Games+Galore\">Games Galore</a>.<br><br>The game is an arcade skating game, featuring nine levels, with partly different problems and control methods. All levels are scrolling vertically on the whole screen, there are no GUI elements, even the amount of lives is not displayed.<br><br>Level 1 is starting in a town, in which you have to dodge obstacles on the street and collecting money on the way. The money is just there for some points, you cannot buy anything with it. With level 2 fantasy elements come in, two dragons are throwing bombs at you which you have to avoid. In two following levels you are on trails and have to jump on the other side to avoid obstacles. In further levels your skateboard can fly and you have to shoot enemies and a huge dragon is appearing. The final level returns to the town setting of level 1.",
