  "description": "In <i>The Spitting Fish</i> the player is a fish and the goal is to spit on insects so that they fall into the water and can be eaten by your kids. At the start of the game a hit gives the player 2 points and a miss -1. The points for a hit increases every second level. 5 hits are needed to move on to the next level (once the time is up). If the player has a hit accuracy over 90% or higher 50 points is added to the score when the level is complete. If the score reaches 0 it's game over. At the bottom of the screen a snail is moving to the left once this snail exits the screen the level is over. Before the next level the player needs to pass a math test to get time to the next level. The math test consists of multiplying number of dots on dice 10 times.",
