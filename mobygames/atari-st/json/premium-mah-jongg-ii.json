  "description": "<em>Premium Mah Jongg II</em> is an slightly enhanced version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/premium-mah-jongg\">Premium Mah Jongg</a>. The most significant update is that all texts in the game are in English language now, while the former game was in German only. Gameplay doesn't changed, wih playing is still traditional Mah Jongg with the &quot;Turtle&quot; board setup and many convenience functions.<br><br>The two playing modes &quot;Solitaire&quot;, with no time limit, and &quot;Tournament&quot;, with different time limits, are accompanied with an off-line multi-player mode called &quot;Happening&quot;. In this mode the game creates eight boards and the game saves those on any amount of floppy disks. Each player participating in the Happening is getting such a disk and can start the game using that disk. The game presents all eight boards with a time limit of 3 minutes for each, and the score for all is accumulated and the results are stored back on disk. According to the manual, the looser of the round has to invite all others to a Chinese Restaurant.<br><br>Playing Mah Jongg often end in an board position where further progress in impossible. <em>Premium Mah Jongg II</em> now has a solver included that can determine if a certain position has a solution or you can even restart the same board and check if it is possible to be cleared at all.<br><br>The UI was improved to support mostly any Atari video hardware and is now running even on graphic cards in very high resolutions. The high-score table was extended to 100 entries and there is an external conversion tool included on disk to convert the old high-score tables to the new format.",
