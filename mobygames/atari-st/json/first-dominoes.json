  "description": "<i>First Dominoes</i> is a computer implementation of the classic game dominoes. The game uses a double nine set of dominoes (each rectangular tile has 0 to 9 dots on both long ends). One human can play against up to four computer opponents. The players takes turns placing one of their tiles on the table. Tiles must connect so that the dots on the edges matches. When a player can't place any of his tiles he has to pass. The game ends when a player has no more tiles left on hand or when no more tiles can be placed on the board, in the later case the winner is determined by the number of dots on the remaining tiles: the player with the least dots on his tiles wins the round.",
