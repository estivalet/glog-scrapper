  "description": "In <i>Pyramax</i>, the player takes the role of an explorer on the search of the Thaalian crystal, a priceless artifact from a long extinguished race. This crystal is at the top of a six-level pyramid which naturally has to be conquered first. Each level consists of a number of rooms which have to be solved in a linear order by activating a touchstone. So the player walks through the rooms in a top-down perspective while dodging the enemies - contact causes the life meter to go down and an empty bar results in losing a live. Picking up power ups rewards bonus points, health refreshments, extra lives or smart bombs.",
