  "description": "Up to six players may compete in this bizarre, futuristic game show presented on the screen of a TV set (wooden finish and all).  Each turn starts with a spin of the wheel: win the bet, and you score - lose, and you participate in a contest of your choice... to the death.  <br><br>The contests are at least slightly deranged, if not downright mad: first there's <em>Mad Space</em>, which challenges you to a lightsaber duel on a floating space rock. Next up is the <em>Mad Machine</em>, where you chase a tiny robot around a room full of mechanical traps, and try to whack it on the head with a metal shield. <em>Mad Tunnel</em> is a frisbee-style game - like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/discs-of-tron\">Discs of Tron</a>, if it were played with sawblades and rockets over a pool of mutated alligators. Finally, <em>Mad Virus</em> tosses you back and forth on a conveyor belt (through cages of hungry mutants) while you try to destroy the gigantic brain that controls it.",
