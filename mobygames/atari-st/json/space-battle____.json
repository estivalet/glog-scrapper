  "description": "<em>Space Battle</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Spacewar%21+games\">Spacewar</a> clone.<br><br>On a single screen, two ships are fighting to destroy each other. The ships can be rotated. Unlike the original game, no gravity is taken into account. The big star in the centre of the screen, which was also present in the original can be turned off optionally, blocking shots and destroying any ship on collision. The second ship can be controlled by AI, so single player games are possible.<br><br>An addition to the <em>Spacewar</em> design is energy management: either accelerating your ship and shooting the weapon consumes energy. If you have enough energy left, you can transfer energy to your shields protecting yourself or, if energy is running low and you require to flee or continue shooting, you can also transfer shield energy to energy.",
