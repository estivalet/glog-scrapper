Hostile space crafts as attack you as want to collide with you as kamikaze. You may shoot them with a weapon and move in four directions on the screen to avoid them or their shots. <br><br>Between the levels to acquire a bonus you (without ability to shoot) should break through different arcade sequences such as fly through the series of small asteroids, or enemy space jets, or acquire the bullets or enhanced weapon avoiding the collisions. <br><br>Each collision means decrease of your available space jets, which quantity may increase with the score. Also the amount of bullets for each your space jets on each level is limited so shoot wisely. <br><br>Finishing the game you may be enlisted in High Score table.",
