  "description": "<i>Jupiter Probe</i> is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player has the task to fly over Jupiter to collect photographic data. Unfortunately there are many alien space ships which try to prevent this. Being hit by an enemy ship or projectile is deadly. Besides the standard shot the player can activate ultrasonics to get rid of all enemies on the screen or shields which grant invulnerability. Of course those useful items are limited and can be replenished by defeating a whole enemy formation. They can't be activated separately; the shields are always used up first.",
