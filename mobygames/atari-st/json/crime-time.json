  "description": "Crime Time is a more or less classical 3rd person point-and-click adventure, with the major difference that you don't click on the graphics, but on controls below the graphics. Actions are done by clicking on words, as is movement.<br><br>The story is a classical mystery setting: two friends go hitchhiking, and since it's raining so bad, they rest in a small hotel. One of the two starts to drink till he's totally out of control. He stumbles into the wrong room, gets knocked out and wakes up next to a corpse. Now, you have to prove you didn't do anything. ",
