  "description": "A third game in the tank combat series, following from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/team-yankee\">Team Yankee</a> (whose story and setting came from a book) and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pacific-islands\">Pacific Islands</a> (set in an imaginary 1995 war). The third game imagines a situation in which Iraq invades Kuwait for a second time.<br><br>The series' main distinguishing feature was the way you always viewed all 4 tanks in a platoon at the same time, via a split screen. Action here is purely mouse-driven. The AI has been significantly updated from previous games in the series. A full roster of tanks and weapons are included, with Iraq mainly using Soviet machinery. A major consideration involves destroying particular buildings for money, and preventing other particular ones being destroyed, also for financial reasons.",
