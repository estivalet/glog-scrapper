  "description": "In <i>Seapower</i> the player must destroy the enemy ships by shooting at them. Shooting is done by clicking on a square in the game area. After each shot the computer will tell the player in what direction of the ship the shot landed. The player has only 6 shots so care has to be taken when deciding where to shoot. The game area consists of 15x10 squares.",
