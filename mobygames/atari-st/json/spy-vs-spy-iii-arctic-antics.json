  "description": "The third and final installment (after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Spy+vs%2e+Spy\">Spy vs. Spy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/spy-vs-spy-the-island-caper\">Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper</a>) sees the spies on an iceberg. They're seeking items (gyroscope, fuel canister, key card) and then seeking to leave via a rocket-ship before a blizzard sets in.  New trap items include a saw (for cutting holes in ice), a plunger detonator (with dynamite), an ice pick and snowshoes.  There are some pitfalls (thin ice and snow drifts).  Hand-to-hand combat is done with snowballs.  Watch your spy's body heat or he'll become a permanent resident.",
