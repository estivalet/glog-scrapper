  "description": "Astro 2000 is an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/asteroids_\">Asteroids</a> inspired game with some extensions over the original game play. The player is controlling a small space craft, and can rotate this and move over the fixed screen. Reaching a border, the ship reappears on the opposite side. The asteroids of the original are still there, but they are in sphere form. On shooting the bigger spheres, they split in several smaller ones, often quicker moving. The bigger asteroids require several hits until they explode. Luckily, if the players ship is hit, not instantly one of the four lives is lost, but only some energy is drained, which can be refilled by an extra, which randomly appears as a collectible. Other extras rewarding a shield, making your ship immune to collisions with the enemies, or freeze all movements of the asteroids for a short time, making the removal easier.",
