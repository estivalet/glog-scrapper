  "description": "<i>ProFlight</i> simulates a Panavia Tornado F Mk3. Through the accompanying 134 page manual, the budding pilot is guided through: an overview of the Tornado and its history, the cockpit functions, flight theory, advanced flying techniques, combat and maneuvers. Added up this gives a indepth insight as to what it takes and feels like to operate and fly the Tornado.<br><br><i>ProFlight</i> aims to incorporate every detail of flight. Accurate taileron, rudder and elevator effects are present at all angles of pitch and roll. You can reach airspeeds of over Mach 2, yet speeds are precise to 0.0006knots, your position within the 200 nautical miles of terrain is accurate to 0.00001ft, and your angle of flight to 0.01 degrees. <br><br>You have radar-guided and heat-seeking missiles at your disposal. Gravity and wheel braking have their effects on motion. Waypoint navigation helps you find your way through this vast world, and a full heads-up display brings the crucial information to you.",
