  "description": "<i>Billy boy</i> is a scrolling platform game written in STOS.<br><br>You find yourself in various enchanted places and to finish each level you have to find its guarding, who will let you out. Collecting yellow stars along the way gives you points. Pressing buttons along the way might reveal pink stars, these should be collected before exiting the level. Enemies such as moving trees and slime blobs will reduce your energy when touched. Almost all enemies can be jumped on so that they sink in to the ground for a while. Food items restores energy. If you catch enough balloons to spell the word <b>bonus</b> you start the next level with the health at 100.<br><br>The game is controlled by joystick.",
