To make things harder there are traps on the track and balls that moves in the opposite direction. The &quot;enemy&quot; balls doesn't appear before you roll into the ball activation square. It has a changing number on it that will decide how many balls that will appear (1-4) at the beginning. The rest of the balls will follow after a while. Hitting a ball or a trap means losing one life, when the number of lives are at zero it's game over.",
