  "description": "<i>Firegame</i> is a board game for one or two players where the objective is to collect 16 house pieces (walls, rooms, roof and windows). Several dangers lurk along the way, fire being one of them. If a fire starts you need to extinguish it using a fire pail. If no player has any buckets the fire will spread and eventually destroy all of the house pieces. If a fire has been put out burnt house pieces must be doused with an extra bucket of water before they can be acquired.<br><br>You start the game with $0. Every turn starts with a die roll then you move corresponding number of steps; if you land on a house piece you may buy it (if you have sufficient money), if you land on a fire bucket square you get a fire bucket, if you land on the fire square you start a fire, and if you land on a risk square you may choose to pick up a risk card. There are 15 different risk cards and they may have a positive or negative outcome. Every time you pass start you get $ 5000. A progress meter at the right side of the screen shows how far each player is from the goal.",
