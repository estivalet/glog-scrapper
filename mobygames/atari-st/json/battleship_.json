  "description": "What can you add to Battleship over the pencil and paper version? A computerized opponent, fairly obviously, as well as the chance to play without using up the earth’s limited paper and pen resources.  The possibility of cheating is removed as well.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Elite+Systems+Ltd%2e\">Elite</a> go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A ‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.\n",
