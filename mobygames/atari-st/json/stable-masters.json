  "description": "In <i>Stable Masters</i> the player takes the role of a horse trainer to raise and train a thoroughbred horse in preparation of horse derby races. The player must first purchase a horse (each of which performs differently in racing). Then the player must choose a jockey that can ride and work with the horse. Finally the player must pick a race course. The player's choices affect the outcome of the race. If the player's horse wins, then the player earns money needed to fund the hiring fees and stable expenses.",
