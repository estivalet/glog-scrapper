  "description": "<em>Galactic Empires</em> is a multi-player turn-based strategy game. Up to seven players compete to conquer the galaxy. Each player is starting on a home planet and a certain amount of ships. Each turn, the fleet or parts of it can be moved. Travelling to other worlds takes time, and reaching distant worlds may take several rounds. During each round, random events may happen, from pirate attacks or natural disasters, affecting one or more players and fleets. If a fleet is approaching a world defended by another fleet, a simply fight takes place without interaction: there is a random element involved, but generally the player with the bigger fleet wins.<br><br>Being a plain multi-player game, the game offers to print the galaxy map upfront. This is handy, because the input of all players has to be typed in blindly (so no other player can see your commands). Commands are always encoded in three numbers: &quot;move X ships from world Y to world Z&quot;.<br><br>The size of the galaxy and the length of play in years can be set at the beginning. Games can be saved and loaded. There is no AI for single player matches.",
