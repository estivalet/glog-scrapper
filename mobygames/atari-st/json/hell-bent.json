  "description": "In <i>Hell Bent</i>, set in 3530, the player takes the role of Captain Drak Hellbent who has to drive off aliens which invaded his home planet Aldonicha. The goal is to destroy a set amount of ground targets in each of the ten vertically scrolling levels. To do so, the player has to change the altitude of the space ship - but flying low creates the danger of crashing into another building. Fuel and shields can be replenished by flying over especially marked buildings. Of course there is also alien opposition which is dealt with by shooting them. Later levels introduce additional challenges like laser fences which have to be passed through with the correct timing.",
