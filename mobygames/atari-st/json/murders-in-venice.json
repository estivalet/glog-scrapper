  "description": "Terrorists plotting against the city of Venice have set a five-hour deadline - as a private detective, it is your job to stop them in that time frame.<br><br>Motion in this mouse-controlled adventure is achieved by clicking on directional arrows, but pay attention to everything you see. You carry an organiser with which you take notes, make illustrations and store information. Your camera can be used to photograph suspicious clues and persons so you can show them to other suspects as evidence later. <br><br>The game plays out in real time so timing and patience are everything, as there are points where you have to wait for certain characters to appear at a certain place at a certain time.",
