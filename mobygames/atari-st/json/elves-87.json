  "description": "You play as a retired Christmas elf, brought in at the last moment to help Santa to save Christmas... but first, you have to figure out what is wrong. Explore the North Pole and beyond, meet a few memorable Christmas characters, and save the day before Santa gets too drunk on fancy blended beverages. Gameplay is through a traditional sentence-parser with no graphics (other than some ASCII art) or sound. ",
