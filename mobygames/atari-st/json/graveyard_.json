  "description": "<em>Graveyard</em> is a slightly extended version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/asteroids_\">Asteroids</a>. Your ship is mounted in the centre of the screen and can rotate in both directions. If you enable thrust, your ship is not moving on the screen like in the original game, but the screen is scrolling.<br><br>You crush asteroids into smaller pieces until they ultimately release some blue crystals which you can collect to get a smart bomb. The smart bomb destroys anything currently visible on the screen. There are three bars on the right: energy, hull strength and the time until a huge alien ship arrives at the scene. On destroying this huge ship, you finish the level. This is not an easy task as you are constantly attacked by very fast fighters and their homing missiles.<br><br>There is a radar indicating all items and enemies in the current section of space, from asteroids, minor enemy vessels, missiles, crystals and the big alien ship.",
