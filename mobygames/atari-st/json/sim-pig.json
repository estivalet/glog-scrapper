  "description": "<em>Sim Pig</em> is a simulation game, in which you have to handle a pig farm. Each turn, you can either buy or sell land, food, or pigs. The player starts with a small farm house and one piece of land with pigs. Each square of land can be used to grow five pigs, so extending the farm can only be done by buying land, which is very expensive. Food is consumed each turn, resulting in constant costs. Income can only be generated by selling pigs, but there are turns in which no demand for pigs is on the market. To increase the demand for meat, you can advertise in different forms for different prices. If pigs are getting ill, a doctor can be called to cure them.<br><br>On the same map, a computer controlled player is also building his farm in direct competition to yours.",
