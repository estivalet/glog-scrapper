  "description": "<i>Bits</i> is a puzzle game where the player has to find the hidden bits on the game board. A typical game board consists of 16x8 tiles (the size can be altered by the player from 4x4 to 32x32) and 5 bits (number of bits can be set to any value between 1 and 16). Each tile the player clicks on can either be a bit or a number that indicates how many bits that tile aligns to (horizontally, vertically and diagonally). <br><br>The game has five different playing modes:<ul>\n<li>Demo: This is a beginner mode that give the player help.</li>\n<li>Extra: A new type of tile that can kill the player is introduced in this mode</li>\n<li>Rätsel: The computer turns a number of tiles for the player and then the player has to find the missing bit(s) without making any mistakes since every other tile except the bit(s) now  will kill the player</li>\n<li>Doppel: Allows two players to compete. This is a timed mode and each move may not take more than 30 seconds</li></ul>\nThis game was written in PureC.",
