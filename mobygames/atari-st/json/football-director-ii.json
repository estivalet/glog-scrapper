  "description": "Football Director II is the successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/football-director\">Football Director</a>, slightly extending the gameplay of the predecessor. Still, you are managing a football team in England, but you can start now with a top division team. For more challenge, you can also start with a small team in league 4 and fight your way to the international competitions.<br><br>Managing a club starts with the staff, you can hire and sack coaches, physios and scouts. You can trade players, if there are any good offers on the market. Building stands helps to increase funds, as well as negotiating contracts to save some money. You get some statistics of your performance, can build up a youth team, set extra training if the team is not performing too well.<br><br>The games themselves are not playable, you just see information about goals and cards and can get some more information after the game to make your conclusions what to change.",
