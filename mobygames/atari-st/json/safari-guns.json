  "description": "You are on safari to make a photo report to save the local animal world from extinction.<br><br>How the game works is simple. Animals will move into the screen and, after some time, leave the screen. Meanwhile you must photograph them.<br><br>Besides the animals, there also poachers, which have to be shot with your real weapon. Kill them fast, or they will kill you.<br><br>If you kill an animal, then you get some penalty points.<br><br>The game itself offers different locations, from the desert to the jungle and a variety of different animals, like zebras, elephants, and others.",
