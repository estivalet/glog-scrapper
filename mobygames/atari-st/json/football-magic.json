  "description": "<i>Football Magic</i> is a minimalistic football team management game. Once the player has chosen which team to manage the players interaction with the game is limited to transfer players in and out of the team, changing players shirt number and take/repay loans. Each week there is a match and on given weeks this is a cup match. The player starts in division 4 and the aim of the game is to move up to the top of division 1 by winning matches. If the team preforms badly there is a risk that the team will go bankrupt and that means game over.\n",
