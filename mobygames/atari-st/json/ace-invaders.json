  "description": "<i>Ace Invaders</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> clone written in 68000 assembler.\nYou control your ship with the joystick and your mission is to destroy as many aliens as possible. If the action gets to heavy you can always dodge the bullets or hide behind one of your four shields, but once your shields are gone you are unprotected. You have only three lives and if an alien manages to land directly on you you lose them all at once. As in the original <i>Space Invaders</i> the aliens moves faster as they get fewer.<br><br>The game features two playing modes: Original Edition and Limited Edition. The difference between the two modes is that the graphics is Limited Edition is better than in the Original one and that the color scheme is changing from game to game.",
