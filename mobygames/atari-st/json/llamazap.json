  "description": "Llamazap is an action game of 25 stages in which you, as a completely hard and unspeakably beweaponed llama, set out to destroy invading alien hordes and protect innocent herbivores from molestation. Usually you fly a spaceship over a bi-directionally scrolling planet, but frequently you must leave the safety of your ship for tentacle-to-hoof combat with your enemies. Your aim is to battle your way through to defeat the last boss on the last level and thereby save the Galaxy and make it a safer place for ungulates everywhere. Along the way you can earn extra kudos by rescuing abducted livestock, saving the dolphins, and rescuing lost and bewildered llamas.",
