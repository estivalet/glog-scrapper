  "description": "Astate is a French point-and-click adventure game with static screens and a icon-based interface. Devoid of inventory (you can carry one item at time), it visually recalls <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Myst\">Myst</a>. As an archaeologist the player has to search the French countryside and its Templar ruins for all the pieces of a missing statue. Each piece collected plays a short animation with part of the storyline. Clicking the right mouse button cycles through several icons, each with a specific function:<br><br>? A <b>pair of boots</b> allows travelling from one place to the other by clicking them on the right or the left side of the screen;<br><br>? A <b>pick-axe</b> and an <b>electric drill</b> for prospecting spots on the screen;<br><br>? A <b>scanner</b> helps finding the right spot to dig for an object;<br><br>? A <b>hand</b> picks up objects;<br><br>? A <b>garbage pail</b> gets rid of a held object .<br><br>There's several ways to die on this game, some (like walking on a dangerous spot) are instantaneous. On some occasions, the player is presented with a screen where he has to avoid falling spiders. It is also possible to get into an unwinnable situation, by getting rid of a necessary object.",
