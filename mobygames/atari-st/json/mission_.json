Each room has one entrance and one exit, and it is filled with mechanical enemies and different useful mechanisms such as elevators, teleports, directional platforms, etc. You should move in four directions to avoid the enemies, or you may shoot them to break them for some period of time. One of 5 kinds of combining suits and helmets are available in certain rooms to increase your health energy, which may be decreased by collision with enemies.<br><br>The highest score will be saved.",
