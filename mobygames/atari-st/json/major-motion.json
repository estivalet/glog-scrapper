  "description": "In <i>Major Motion</i>, The Draconian League have taken over the roads and made them dangerous for ordinary road users. You are in control of a car, driving up a vertically scrolling road with occasional forks in it, making the game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Spy+Hunter\">Spy Hunter</a>. <br><br>The car is mounted with guns, and so are many enemy cars, but cars can be rammed off the road as well as shot. Watch out for other enemy vehicles such as helicopters though; be sure to avoid their bullets.<br><br>You can drive into the back of open lorries to gain upgraded weapons. Weapons are activated via keyboard presses, which makes the game more difficult than it would otherwise be. Sound and music sampled from suitably action-packed films aims to add to the atmosphere.",
