  "description": "Based on the Avalon Hill boardgame, Third Reich lets you play not only as Hitler and his staff, but also as the allied powers. The scenario is limited to the European theatre.<br><br>The game is played in rounds of three months, split into several phases such as declaration of war, movement, battle and construction.<br><br>You begin the game by declaring war. Which front you open up first will determine the further development of the war. Warring nations are split into two kinds – great military powers such as the allies and the axis, and neutral states.<br><br>One resource to be househeld with is your gross national product. This is the resource that will be expended when you build up your armies, and eventually send them to war.<br><br>The game has a multitude of scenarios, each with its own goals; just killing your enemy is not the best way to win, if at all.<br><br>Just as in the board game, the action takes place on a hexagon map of Europe.",
