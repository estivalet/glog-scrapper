  "description": "<i>Battle Zone</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Worms\">Worms</a> clone and just like in the original Worms the aim of the game is to erase the other team from the map. Unlike the original game there is no time limit for the turns or the whole match.<br><br>There are two game modes: &quot;Single Match&quot;  and &quot;Tournament&quot;. Tournament mode allows up to ten players to compete. Players can choose among 30 teams to play and each team consists of 4 worms. The game features 13 different landscapes with names such as City, Food and Atarist. <br><br>Every team has an arsenal that consists of 14 different things: bazooka, rocket, grenade, cluster bomb, dynamite, air strike, teleport, fire punch, tunnel, grinders, machine gun, kamikaze, plasma gun and skip go. Everything in the arsenal is limited, even the &quot;skip go&quot;-option which is set to 99. When firing a projectile weapon or throwing a grenade attention must be paid to the wind, both strength and direction matters.\n",
