  "description": "When converting the original <i>Leader Board</i> golf simulation to the 16-bit systems, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Sculptured\">Sculptured</a> took advantage of the power of these systems by adding trees, bunkers and rough, thus increasing the variety of the challenge. The same basic features still exist in terms of shot styles, and in the way a 72-hole contest can be arranged through a variation of the 4 provided 18-hole courses. Hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse to affect shot angle, then use the right button to fire the shot away.",
