  "description": "<i>Magical Myths</i> is an educational game that teaches Greek mythology. It consists of three different stories: The Greek Gods, Pandora's Box and King Midas. Each one consists of text accompanied with images, including some that are animated. The stories themselves are not interactive more than pressing a button to progress. After finished reading a story the player is asked to answer some questions. These can be based on either reading skills or vocabulary building. There are different question formats: multiple choice or fill-in the blanks for reading questions and fill-in, synonyms or antonyms for vocabulary questions.<br><br>The program comes with an editor called myth maker that allows the user to create new stories as well as accompanying questions with answers. There is also a mythical match game which is a concentration game where the players have to flip cards to reveal pictures with the aim of uncovering all the images. ",
