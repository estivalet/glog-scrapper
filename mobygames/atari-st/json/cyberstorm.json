The game starts at The Sea of Mesopotamia and you are armed with a laser, three smart bombs and a cloaking device. You start the game with three lives. The gameplay reminds much of that in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Defender\">Defender</a>; you can steer your space ship to the left or right and at the bottom of the screen you have a scanner that shows where the enemies are.
