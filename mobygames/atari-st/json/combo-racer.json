  "description": "This racing game comes with a novelty - instead of the more conventional vehicles, it sets you riding a sidecar in a game with realistic and arcade elements. The circuits are based on real ones, although the opposition (of which there are 9) are known simply by first names such as David and Paul.<br><br>The display appears to use real 3D, with some fairly terrifying directional changes, although it doesn't tilt as you turn. A full map of your position relative to your rivals is presented at the top of the screen. Crashes cause gradual engine damage, reducing your initial 140mph top speed by a slight amount each time - you'll also lose time as you rejoin. Before each race you must set a qualifying lap, which allows you multiple attempts.<br><br>The game has a built-in track editor.",
