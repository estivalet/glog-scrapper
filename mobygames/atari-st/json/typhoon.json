  "description": "<i>Typhoon</i> is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player uses a space ship to kill aliens. The game has about 50 levels in changing environments, e.g. an asteroid belt, a jungle or a futuristic city. Special symbols, available at the beginning of each level, grant an extra life or one of three special upgrades (like a better weapon or a shield). The latter are only temporary.<br><br>The game features two especially dangerous enemies: indestructible, rotating plates and skulls which grant instant death when shot. The game always shows how many points are missing before getting a better rank in the high score list.",
