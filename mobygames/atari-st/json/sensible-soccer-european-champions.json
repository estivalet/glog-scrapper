  "description": "<i>Sensible Soccer: European Champions</i> is a soccer (football) game similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Kick+Off\">Kick Off</a> series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen, but allowing player to view around half the pitch.<br><br>The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (‘dribbling’ in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.<br><br>The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has three star players who are more gifted that the others.",
