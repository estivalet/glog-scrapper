  "description": "<i>UMS (Universal Military Simulator)</i> attempts to cover the ground of games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Empire\">Empire</a> and go beyond, simulating almost every aspect of warfare in a realistic manner. Battles can range from ancient history to a science-fiction future, with famed battled such as Gettysburg and the Battle of Hastings built in. The view system operates at multiple levels, from a single unit up to the whole theater.<br><br>However, there is no naval element whatsoever and the design pays little attention to extremely important wargaming concepts like fog of war.<br><br>The game spawned a sequel, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=UMS+II\">UMS II</a>.",
