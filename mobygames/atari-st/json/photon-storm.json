  "description": "As with all <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Jeff+Minter\">Jeff Minter</a> games, this has a definite distinctive look and feel (although no Llamas or lawnmowers this time). It's a top-down shoot 'em up resembling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sinistar%27\">Sinistar</a>, with the unusual twist of being mouse-controlled, using the left button to fire and the right button to thrust. You can rotate the direction of fire while holding fire down, allowing you to move one way and fire another way (another Minter tradition - witness <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Llamatron%27\">Llamatron</a>). A Boost function exists to power up your ship, including plutonium pods which unusually can be collected and harvested by the end-of-level enemies as well as your own ship. After the main levels you must steer the ship through a tight tunnel, avoiding contact with the walls.",
