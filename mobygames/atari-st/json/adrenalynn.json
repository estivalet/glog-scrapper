  "description": "<i>Adrenalynn</i> is a futuristic, action-oriented sports game. Artificial Intelligence took over Earth and the winner of the &quot;Adrenalynn&quot; championship may decide humanity's future. So naturally the player participates with the goal to win the major league (there are overall three with increasing difficulties). The game itself is a bit like indoor soccer with four athletes (armed with guns) and on a smaller playing field with bumpers. A match lasts 120 seconds and there are various power-ups to collect. Each player only takes control over a single athlete. The sportsmen show up on the screen as balls.",
