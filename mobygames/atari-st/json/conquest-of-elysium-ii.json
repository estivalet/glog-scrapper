  "description": "<i>Conquest of Elysium II</i> is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world. You control any one of 20 possible factions, each with its own unique units, spells, abilities and even resources. Your goal is to control resource producing locations, amass an army while still protecting your citadel and your commanders, and conquer all of your opponents. The game features include equipable items, peasant happiness (which determines how likely is your resource gathering to start a peasant rebellion and mine strikes), season change (which affect your resource gathering) and many special events (from the arrival of unexpected heroes in your villages to the coming of the Apocalypse).<br><br>The game can be played in hotseat multiplayer, or in single player against up to eight computer controlled opponents across randomly generated maps. The difficulty of your opponents and the type of random map (which resources are abound, how high is bandit activity) you play can all be customized. The game also includes three custom-made unique scenarios.",
