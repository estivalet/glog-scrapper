  "description": "<i>Trader 2</i> is a trading game coded in STOS. The game is set in the middle ages (starting year is 1357) and you start your career as a trader in Bristol with only a sloop, one crew member and just under 1000 pounds at your disposal. There are seven different goods you can trade with: Corn, Wood, Spices, Salt, Wool, Gems and Ale. \nYou can also arm your ships and its crew with four different weapons: Cannons, Guns, Bows and Swords. Arming your fleet can be a good idea since merchant ships might attract the attention of pirates. When you have loaded you ship and hired enough crew you can select between seven different cities to trade with (there are eight cities in the game): London, Brugge, Hamburg, Luebeck, Malmoe, Riga and Novgorod.<br><br>Random events such as floods affects the prices of certain types of goods. When you have earned some money you can expand your merchant fleet with new ships. In <i>Trader 2</i> there are three types of ships, all with different cargo capacity: Hulk (100 tons), Merchantman (60 tons) and Sloop (20 tons).<br><br>The game has no sound and is controlled with the mouse.\n",
