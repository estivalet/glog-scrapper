  "description": "This game is a simulator based on a minority sport: the free climbing. It's a climbing discipline in which you must use the hands (obviously) and special boots as ascend elements. For, and this is the key of &quot;Free Climbing&quot;, it's necessary that the wall to climb is furrowed by cracks and spurs which the climber can use as strong-point. <br><br>This game also includes 14 different walls that we must try to climb by means of this system, but considering that we have a time limit to culminate each ascend. Our climber can independently move each one of his arms and legs, and our mission consists in finding out which of his extremities we must move to obtain a good power and strong-point to thus continue our climb.",
