  "description": "<em>Double Bobble 2000</em> is a port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/bubble-bobble\">Bubble Bobble</a> to the Atari Falcon. Gameplay is converted from the arcade machine and not the rather inadequate <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/bubble-bobble\">commercial port</a> to the Atari ST hardware from 1987.<br><br>All 100 levels are present, the two-player mode is implemented and game-play and bonus system are adequately converted, even shooting at the walls is rewarded like in the original game. All extra-weapons are there, either the yellow and blue candy, the umbrellas, bombs, and bubbles shooting lightnings, as well as extra bonus point elements like the crown and others. Control of the dragons is precise and can be mapped on the keyboard, but also joysticks and joypads are usable. You can easily jump on your bubbles to gain heights. The famous &quot;Extend&quot; characters are available, and of course the white wale hunting you on taking too long is also available. On clearing a level there is a bit more time to collect bonus elements like in the original. The game is starting with four lives and seven credits.<br><br>The graphics are in high-color mode (65.000 colors), so the original platform graphics is redrawn using much more colors. Sampled voices and effects are added as additional effects. A high-score table can be reached. Being a shareware licenced game, on registering the player got an editor, which can handle levels using the mouse, replace graphics. Also, the extension <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Double+Bobble+-+The+Further+Adventures\">Double Bobble - The Further Adventures</a> with 100 new levels was granted.",
