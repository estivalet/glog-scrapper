  "description": "Transputor is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a>-type game, which is played in an isometric perspective and therefore an additional dimension is added to them.<br><br>The game is inspired by CRL's own 8-bit game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ball-breaker\">Ball Breaker</a>, which used the idea with isometric perspective before. The ball physics are like in many other games of that type: hitting the ball with one side let the ball fly to this side, often with a speed change which is unpredictable.<br><br>The player's bat is sitting on the right side, moving up and down, blocks being hit are vanishing, and if there are blocks stapled above them, they drop to the ball level becoming destructible. There are many special stones, giving different amounts of points, adding lives, changing the size of the bat either to the good (bigger) or bad (smaller). The player have a certain amount of missiles, and some blocks can only be destroyed with missiles.<br><br>There are 32 levels to beat, with increasingly difficulty.",
