  "description": "Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on &quot;Admiral Benbow&quot;, his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witnesses everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After he dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.<br><br><i>Treasure Island</i> is a text adventure, an adaptation of the classic 1883 novel of the same name by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,222329/\">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>. Unlike the book, the game is written in a second-person perspective. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of built-in hint system. The player can ask them about anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/infocom\">Infocom</a>'s standard features like pronouns and chain commands. ",
