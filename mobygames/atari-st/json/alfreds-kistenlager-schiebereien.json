  "description": "<em>Alfreds Kistenlager Schiebereien</em> is a conversion of the puzzle game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/soko-ban\">Soko-ban</a> to be played on the monochrome display. A worker named Alfred must move boxes distributed in a level to their destination spot. All levels are on a single screen.<br><br>It features all 50 levels from the original, but also adding an editor to modify existing or add new levels, which can also be saved to disk. Alfred is controlled with the cursor keys and as additional difficulty, you are only allowed to run three times into a wall. If this happens, Alfred resigns and the game is lost, so concentration is required if running long distances. For some convenience, macros with returning to a specific spot are included. The amount of steps and time required to solve a level are shown. A high-score table can be reached.",
