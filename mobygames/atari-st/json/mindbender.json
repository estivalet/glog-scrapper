  "description": "Mindbender uses similar gameplay principles to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/deflektor\">Deflektor</a>, which means that you have indirect control over a beam of light. On each of the 50 levels you must guide it from a starting point to an ending point, taking out all the enemies along the way. Rotating each of the many mirrors on the level to send the beam onto the points the enemies hover over does this – reaching many of them will involve several attempts at finding the right combination of angles. Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tron\">Tron</a>-style.",
