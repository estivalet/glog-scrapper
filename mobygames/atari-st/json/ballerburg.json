  "description": "<i>Ballerburg</i> is a turn based artillery game. The game was released as public domain and is entirely in German. There are castles on the left and right side of the screen, and there is a random generated mountain in the middle. Each player has a castle with several cannons and a king. On each turn a player can buy cannonballs and powder, rebuild the castle, and aim and fire a cannon at the opponent. The goal is to hit the king of your opponent.<br><br>Before a game starts, each player can choose from various castles, each castle has a different layout of cannons, storage rooms and the king. When a storage room for gun powder or cannonballs is hit, the player loses all his supply of gun powder or cannonballs. When shooting, the wind influences the trajectory of the cannonballs.<br><br>The game also has economic and sim-like elements. Each castle has a set of economic assets, like money, a population and taxes. Prices for gun powder and rebuilding vary from turn to turn, and the player can choose to raise or lower taxes to get more income. Your population will decrease when tax is too high, and they will be added to the other players castle.",
