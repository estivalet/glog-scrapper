  "description": "Killing Spree is a shoot-'em-up, which scrolls to the horizon. The landscape is created with polygons, and zooming sprites are used for enemies and details like trees. The player flies with his spacecraft with selectable acceleration, can move up, down, left and right, which causes the landscape also to scroll horizontally. The ship's defence is a single weapon, which is required to shut down energy barriers, turrets or moving enemies like flying saucers, which split into many smaller enemies on destroying, or to attack ships on the ground.<br><br>The landscape itself is also an opponent, with walls moving periodically, having the player to tune the acceleration of the ship carefully to pass these obstacles. There is no score counter, the only purpose is to survive as long as possible.<br><br>An editor is delivered with the game, allowing to create new fractal landscapes, modifying them, view in 2D or 3D, place ships and save/load the created levels.<br><br>The game was released in the game competition on the Outline 2014 convention, winning the second place in that competition.",
