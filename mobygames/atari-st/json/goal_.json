  "description": "<i>Goal!</i> takes the basic gameplay of Dino Dini's previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Kick+Off\">Kick Off</a> games, but updates most features in some way. <br><br>Teams from various European countries are included, and you can customise these by moving players around, and changing the starting lineups and formations. An Arcade Challenge mode sees you play matches against each of the five computer team speeds, in succession, until you lose one. You can also arrange leagues or play individual matches.<br><br>A wide range of options are included, with variable wind settings, a range of pitches and referees, variable match lengths, and the chance to play up/down or left/right, a choice of close or distant view, and variable computer speed and skill. All of these features can be combined in various ways with each other.",
