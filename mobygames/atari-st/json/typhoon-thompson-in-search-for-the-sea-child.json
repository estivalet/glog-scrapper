  "description": "<i>Typhoon Thompson in Search of the Sea Child</i> is an enhanced remake of the Apple II game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/airheart\">Airheart</a>. It is an unusual game where you have to fly round an ocean and shoot at various unusual beasts.<br><br>The plot centers around a &quot;Sea Child&quot; who was stolen, and Typhoon Thompson is sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types (who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT).<br><br>While the original game was controllable with a joystick, this game is mouse controlled.",
