  "description": "<i>Deathstrike</i> is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Scramble\">Scramble</a>. The player controls a futuristic aircraft, bombing and shooting enemy objects on ground and in air, while having to make sure he doesn't run out of fuel. Regaining it is possible by destroying the corresponding depots. The player may also find that the room for maneuvering can be significantly limited as the game progresses, once the landscape changes from rather open terrain to narrow cave systems that provoke crashing.",
