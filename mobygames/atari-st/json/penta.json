  "description": "<em>Penta</em> is a puzzle game with moving mechanics. The 5x5 board is filled with numbers from 1 up to 25. The goal is to sort them from the upper left corner (1) to the lower right corner (25). You can do this by rotating either columns or rows (e.g. if you rotate a row to the right with number &quot;6&quot; most left, after rotating it will be most left). For each level you only have a specific amount of moves to reorder the numbers. Running out of moves ends the game.<br><br>The boards are not pre-defined, but randomly created by the computer making a specific amount of rotations from an sorted board. This amount is increased in later levels or with higher difficulty settings. You can chose between two playing: the &quot;Challenge Mode&quot; in which you progress as far as possible. &quot;Daily new fun stuff&quot; mode presents single levels of four different difficulty settings. A high-score table keeps track of the success of the player.",
