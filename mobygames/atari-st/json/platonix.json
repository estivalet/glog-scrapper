  "description": "Platonix is a puzzle game in which your goal is to clear a complete board of stones. You control a cursor and after moving this cursor on a field, the field vanishes and you cannot go back. Therefore the route to clear all stones have to be carefully planned to avoid a lock in. Often there are several possibilities to solve the level.<br><br>Points are only rewarded after finishing a level. The amount is determined by the leftover time from the counter and the amount of lives left after clearing the level. Any ten levels completed a password is given.<br><br>The game has a high-score table and the time limit can be turned off in the options.",
