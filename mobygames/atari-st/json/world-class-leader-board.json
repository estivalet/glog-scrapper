  "description": "Before the long-running <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Links+series\">Links series</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Access+Software\">Access Software</a> produced the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Leader+Board\">Leader Board</a> lineage, which concludes here. Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as players dodge the bunkers, water and rough, which make for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original.<br><br>A course editor is included. The courses provided include real locations: St. Andrews (Scotland), Cypress Creek and Doral Country Club (USA) and a fictional one, The Gauntlet, which, as the name suggests, is designed to push the player's skills to the maximum.<br><br>The PC version utilizes the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via the company's patented <i>RealSound</i> process. Quips like &quot;No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap&quot;, &quot;Straight onto the fairway&quot;, and &quot;Looks like he hit the tree, Jim&quot; are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.",
