  "description": "<i>Midi-Maze</i>, played on Atari STs linked up via MIDI cables, is among the first multiplayer first-person shooter for home micros, and a descendant of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/maze-war\">Maze War</a> from the 1970s.<br><br>The game is set in a maze with 90° corners, and all graphics are drawn with filled polygons. Weapon systems are limited to a plain gun with a small reloading interval. All the participants are represented by big, floating smiling faces. Up to sixteen players may compete simultaneously, but those who wish to train before a match can do it alone against drones. It is possible both to play one against all or to team up.",
