  "description": "<i>Alterra</i> is a strategy game where the objective is to use the armies to conquer all of the cities. An army can contain up to eight different type of units. Movement cost depends on the terrain and mountains is impassable except for flying armies. Water may only be entered and exited by cities or by harbours. Own cities produces a certain amount of gold each turn and gold can be used for recruiting units to the armies or hire heroes. Battle outcome is decided by die rolls: both fighting units roll a 24 sided die and if the attacker's roll is higher than the defener's total strength and the defender's roll is equal or lower than the attacker's total strength then the defender takes one damage. Various conditions may give players bonuses in battles, for example if a hero is with the army it will be stronger. Cities can be defended with up to 32 different units. The game comes with two maps and a map editor. As for version 1.01 AI is not yet implemented.",
