  "description": "This game recreates the battle in 1879 where a British outpost at Rorke's Drift manned by 137 men managed to repel an attack by force of over 4,000 Zulu warriors.<br><br>This is a real-time strategy game where the player can pause the game and issue orders during a command mode, after which the orders are carried out and the battle progresses. You can only play as the British and two scenarios are available - one where the Zulus will attack according to the historical Order of Battle and deployment, and the other where the Zulus vary their strategy of attack.<br><br>Individual troops are represented in the game as animated soldier miniatures, with the player being able to move individual soldiers, resolve individual hand-to-hand combat situations and order a variety of different firing positions for each soldier.",
