  "description": "<i>Color Clash</i> is a platform puzzle game. The player controls a chameleon that can change into different colors, each color gives it a different skill.<br><br>The evil Dr Nippon has trapped in his experiments and you must complete all 36 stages to escape from the maze. A stage is completed when you have eaten all insects. Avoid touching the monsters or you'll explode. You can eat color blocks to change color and thus change your special ability.<br><br>Yellow, jumping ability (default).\nGreen, use your tail to break blocks or kill enemies.\nRed, float like a helium balloon only stopped by blocks.\nBlue, use your tongue to grab and move blocks.<br><br>There are five types of enemies you must avoid. Red grunts simply walk left and right. Green monsters can also jump down platforms. Robots try to seek you out and can also climb up platforms. There are two types of floating enemies, rockets that move from left to right and squid like creatures that go up and down. Both the chameleon and the monsters can jump down any gap at the bottom of the screen and reappear at the top. However, this doesn't work for any gaps at the left or right side of the screen.<br><br>There also are two special blocks, a grey block which kills you if you eat it and a fire block that shoots a horizontal laser beam destroying blocks and enemies in its path.",
