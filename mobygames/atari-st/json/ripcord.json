  "description": "<i>Ripcord</i> is a small game where you have to make sure that a parachute jumper lands in the designated area. A plane crosses the screen from right to left and by clicking the left mouse button you decide where the guy will jump, a click on the right mouse button will then release the parachute. The target area will move between jumps and sometimes wind affects the jumper. When wind affects the jump it is important to release the chute at the right time, however there is no indication of any winds until the parachute is released. <br><br>A game consists of  8 jumps. There is no music in the game, only sound effects.",
