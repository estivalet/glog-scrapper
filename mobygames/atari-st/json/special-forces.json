  "description": "<i>Special Forces</i> is a top-down arcade shooting game with a dash of strategy.<br><br>It is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/airborne-ranger\">Airborne Ranger</a>.<br><br>When times are rough, the American people rely on their army. And when times are rough, the American army relies on their special forces. A small group of highly trained, superbly skilled, well-armed and clean-shaven elite soldiers boldly go where no man has gone before. At least no honest man.<br><br><i>Special Forces</i> let's you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jagged-alliance\">Jagged Alliance</a>, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green.<br><br>16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist's arctic ice to the drug cartel's native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.",
