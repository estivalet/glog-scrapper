  "description": "The star of the game is Colin Curly, a dog, who loves Quavers (snack). It was a stormy night and Colin was playing his favorite game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/push-over\">Pushover</a>. Accidentally, Colin has been digitized and curlified into his computer at the moment he completed the final level of the game. Colin has been trapped inside his own computer and an amazing array of challenges are standing between him and the escape from this electronic nightmare.<br><br>You have to move Colin Curly from the ENTRY packet to the EXIT packet by jumping from one platform to the next. Colin can only escape from a level if ALL the platforms have shut before he reaches the exit.<br><br>As Colin steps off a platform, it will slide shut behind him, never to open again unless it has special properties.  So, it is important to work out the correct route to follow in order to close all the platforms before Colin reaches the EXIT while still being able to move around the level.",
