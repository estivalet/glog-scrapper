  "description": "<i>Marlowe</i> is an interactive adventure game in which the player assumes the role of a private detective who has to solve a crime. The story begins in Marlowe's office where he discovers a strange letter from a vanished friend. A mysterious letter puzzle will be just the first step to find him and solve this crime story. <br><br>The screen is divided in three windows: on the left, a dialog box is displayed which describes the current game situation and enables communication with other characters. In the centered graphic window Marlowe's location is displayed, and in the aerial view floor plan on the right side the player can choose which buildings or rooms will be entered next. Along the way collected items can be managed in a graphical inventory and used when required.",
