  "description": "<i>Tetris II Strikes Back</i> is an enhanced <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Atari+ST\">Tetris</a> variant. It features two playing modes: the classic Tetris gameplay and a mode in which predefined patterns of stones are already present in the levels and the level is finished if all of those predefined stones are removed.<br><br>For both playing modes the game has a two-player simultaneous cooperation mode, in which the (single, not split screen) play field is twice the width of the single player mode. The players can work together to fill the lines and collect bombs to remove uncomfortable stone formations.",
