  "description": "In <i>Brain Blaster</i>, the player wants to gain an audience with a wise man. But this is not for free: he wants to see gold. To earn it, the player needs to solve the 30 levels of this puzzle game. The basic principle is simple: the game shows a puzzle stone pattern on a 5x5 field. Then it disappears and the player needs to rebuild it.  <br><br>The needed stones are gained by collecting them from the middle of the screen - they get spit it out in regular intervals. The game tells the player if a placed stone is correct or not.\nSome of the stones should be avoided because they don't fit the pattern while others give advantages when used, e.g. to delete an accidentally placed stone or they show the original pattern. The time limit is only there in single-player; when playing with up to two other people the fastest player wins. ",
