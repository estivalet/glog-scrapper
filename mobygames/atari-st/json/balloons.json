  "description": "<i>Balloons</i> is a puzzle game in which the player in each level has to collect a certain number of things.<br><br>Every level contains several balloons that can be popped giving the player a small amount of points. Balloons may also hide all or some of the items that the player must collect to complete the level. Once all items have been collected the exit appears. In addition to balloons and items that has to be collected there are several other items spread out across the levels that might be of use to the player, such as a clock for extra time for example. On later levels moving enemies will appear. At the start of the game the player has three lives. A Life is lost if the time runs out or if the player walks into a trap or falls into a hole.<br><br>The shareware version of this game comes with 50 levels.",
