  "description": "<em>Super Hangman ST</em> is a conversion of the <em>Hangman</em> pen-and-paper game. The goal is to find a word in a certain amount of rounds. The word has a known specific length and each turn, the player can chose a letter. If the letter is in the word, the letter is shown at all position it is in the word. If the letter is not included, the gibbet grows by one piece until the complete man hangs.<br><br>The game is in German, so also all searched words are in that language. There are 466 words included, and the player can chose how many rounds to play.",
