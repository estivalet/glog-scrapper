  "description": "An official licensed game of the 1991 Rugby World Cup, bringing a sport rarely seen on home computers to life. The game recreates the exact structure of the tournament, and includes all 16 teams. <br><br>The gameplay has been simplified slightly, in the aim of creating a more flowing and less complicated game. As a result, scrums are frequent, penalties are absent, and a flowing running game is favoured. The teams are of different abilities, reflecting their real life skills.",
