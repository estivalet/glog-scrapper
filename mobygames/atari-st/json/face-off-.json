  "description": "The action in this ice hockey game is viewed from a side-scrolling perspective with a semi-3D effect. The puck loosely sticks to the player as he skates, and the netminders are CPU-controlled. Fights and penalties can be turned on or off, and the length of the match can be varied. <br><br>As well as individual one or two player modes, a full managerial mode is included. This sees you take control of an international team and guide them through a full schedule of matches, including developing their skills and team-work.",
