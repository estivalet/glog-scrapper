  "description": "<i>Championship Manager 93/94</i> is the successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/championship-manager\">Championship Manager</a>. The text-based interface remains the same, but several new features have been added to the game. Included now are reserve squads, transfers with international players and injury time. Also, the match engine has been slightly changed to give more information. As it could be expected, all statistics are up to date with the 93/94 season, including real world teams and players.",
