  "description": "In this tank simulation game based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,367943/\">Harold Coyle's</a> book of the same name, <i>Team Yankee</i> is a squad of crack tank drivers and gunners. They are in the latest tanks, such as the well known Abrams M1, Bradley M2, T-72 and T-62, armed with lasers, machine guns and SABOTs. As Commander Sean Bannon, you must use these resources correctly in five missions ranging from defending a hill to attacking a centre through a forest.<br><br>The control interface of the game is somewhat unique as it features a four-way split screen with different control options in order to grant direct orders to four individual platoons of tanks. The game simulates instruments of war including thermal imaging in a detailed manner, as well as giving access to scrolling maps of the battlefield as combat unfolds.",
