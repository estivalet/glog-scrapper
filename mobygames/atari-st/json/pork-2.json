  "description": "<i>Pork 2</i> is a parody of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Zork+II\">Zork II</a> and a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pork-i-the-great-underground-sewer-system\">Pork I: The Great Underground Sewer System</a>. A distraught waitress working at the Cajuin Fried Chicken House explains to the player that a unusual large Chicken Gizzard escaped from the Chicken House and is now terrorizing the neighborhood as a tap dancer at the local Burlesque house. <br><br>The player must now do something about the Chicken Gizzard before everyone goes crazy. When the game starts, it continues on from where Pork I ended. The player is at the bottom of a deep crevice right beside the house where Pork I started. <br><br>As a classic text adventure there is no graphics and no sound. The game features a special lewd mode that can be accessed by answering some questions.",
