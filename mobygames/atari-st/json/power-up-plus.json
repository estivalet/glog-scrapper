  "description": "<em>Power Up Plus</em> is the enhanced successor of <a id=\"ddd2b512a4cac4a05286e1920b75f0974\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Power+Up\">Power Up</a>. The racing game is inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Super+Cars+series\">Super Cars games</a>. The racing track is viewed from the top and is scrolling in all eight directions. Playing a season, a sequence of tracks has to be solved and points are rewarded for the position the player is reaching at the end of the race after three rounds. Collecting enough points to reach the top of the league after the season is the ultimate goal of the game. There are four different track sets: Mini, Easy, Medium and Hard, which basically are separated by the length of the track. The driving skills of the computer controlled opponents can be switched in three levels from Easy to Hard.<br><br>The races are spiced up by the weapons each player can use: each car can shot to the front and leave oil to disturb following cars. If hit by either shot or oil, the car is uncontrollable for some moments. The usage of weapons can be turned off in the options. In two player mode the screen is split horizontally, giving both players their own view of their current position on the track. Like in the normal game additional computer opponents are on the street and the season is played. Two additional multi-player modes are implemented: in &quot;Duel&quot;, the game's view is a single window. If one of the cars get behind and is getting out of view of the area the leader sees, the cars are set back and the behind player is getting a penalty. The other multi-player mode &quot;Duel Special&quot; is featuring the same rules, but additional computer controlled cars are on the streets.<br><br>The game runs on any Atari ST system but is using practically any additional hardware possible (blitter, STE sound) and even can utilize exotic hardware like the MV16 and Replay Pro digital sound systems. A track editor is included with the game, allowing to create new tracks in a convenient way.",
