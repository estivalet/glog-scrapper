  "description": "<i>Autorama</i> is a labyrinth game written in 68000 assembler. You control a racing car, and on each level you have to collect all flags before you run out of gas. Certain flags gives you more gas. Enemy cars are chasing you and they do their best to crash into you. If they get too close you can press the fire button to release a puff of smoke that will confuse them for a while. As the game progresses more enemies appear and other things which makes the game harder, like boulders, appear on the level.",
