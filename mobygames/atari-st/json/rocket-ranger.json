  "description": "In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. These items are sent back in time to you in order to change the result of the war by using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.<br><br>The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.<br><br>An &quot;Extended Collector's Edition&quot; of the game was released in 2018. It is a limited edition of 500 and contains the game in multiple languages and for multiple platforms, and contains as bonuses posters, stickers, postcards, and the soundtrack on vinyl.",
