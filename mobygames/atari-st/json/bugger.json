  "description": "<em>Bugger!</em> is an extended conversion of the classic coin-op <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/frogger\">Frogger</a> for one up to six players. Frogs are standing at one side of a road and want to reach the other side. Carefully jumping up and down the frog can change the lanes on the road, avoiding the many cars driving on it. Cars are not simply passing by with a constant speed in this game, but also accelerate or get slower on occasion.<br><br>Beside converting the original game, <em>Bugger!</em> adds different playing modes: after setting a time limit, the goal is to reach as many points (road crosses) as possible. Another mode is limited by the amount of lives: cross the road as many times as possible before until you died for the specific amount of times. The speed of the frogs can be adjusted in three levels: slow, medium and fast. In a multi-player game, up to six human or computer controlled frogs compete with each other. Three frogs are starting at the lower side of the road, three on the upper side. The player with the most points scored according to the chosen playing mode wins. Extensively (and morbid) statistics of the frog's death are shown after each game. A high-score table can be reached.",
