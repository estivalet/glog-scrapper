  "description": "<i>Oh No! Not More Radioactive Mineshafts!</i> is a collect'em-up game for one player.\nYou have been dumped at the bottom of a huge mineshaft and in order to escape you must escape from each level of this gigantic mineshaft. To complete a level you must do one of two things: either collect as many of the blocks as possible or collect a specific number of each coloured block within the time limit.<br><br>Blocks of different colors falls from the top of the screen down to the bottom and then slides to the left or right. The blocks has to be collected in the air by hitting them with your head or you will lose a life. Blocks appear at random so there is no guarantee that you can collect the right combination of blocks to complete the level. The faster a block moves the more points it gives.",
