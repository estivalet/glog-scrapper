  "description": "<i>Sharks</i> is a hang-man game, but instead of getting hanged the player gets eaten by a shark.<br><br>Guess the word that is hidden behind the red tiles. For every wrong guess the player is moved one step closer to the water and when the player guesses wrong for the 8th time he is pushed into the water and eaten by the shark. If the player manages to guess the word a helicopter comes to the rescue. At the beginning of the game the player can choose which wordlist will be used during the game (the games comes with 14 wordlists). A game lasts for 10 rounds.<br><br>The game comes with a wordlist creator so that the player can create his/her own wordlists.",
