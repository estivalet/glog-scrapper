  "description": "In Planet Lander you have to land your space craft within the given time. You start at 10000 feet with 5000 barrels of fuel and you must land your space craft on a platform measuring 500x500 feet within 2000 microns (the games time unit). A big arrow marks the ideal landing spot but winds makes it hard to land and you may not hit the ground with a speed over 5 feet's/micron.",
