  "description": "<em>Mem</em> is following the idea and the rules of the board game <em>Memory</em>. 40 cards are placed randomly in a rectangular grid of the size 5x8. Each symbol is included in the cards twice. The goal is to find as many pairs of symbols as possible. Each turn, a player is allowed to turn two symbols, and if they do not match, turn them face down again.<br><br>The game is a single player game only, with the challenge to solve the board with as few tries as possible. There is no-multiplayer mode and no computer opponent to battle. Found pairs do not vanish, but stay visible on the field. If a board is cleared the score is shown and you can begin again.",
