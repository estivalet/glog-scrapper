  "description": "The <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a> arcade game was the obvious inspiration for this shoot 'em up. As a lone soldier you must shoot your way through waves of soldiers, tanks and helicopters, armed with only bullets and grenades. You aim at these by controlling a crosshair with the mouse, using the left button to shoot bullets and the right button to fire grenades. You are limited for both of these, but more can be collected as they appear throughout the game by shooting them. Your strength is limited and deteriorates as you get hit - avoid letting it drop to zero.",
