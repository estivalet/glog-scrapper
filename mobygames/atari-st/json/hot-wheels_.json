  "description": "Hot Wheels is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a> inspired game, published for the ST User magazine. On 15 tracks, one or two players try to finish first, by either being faster than the opposite cars, or simply ramming the other cars to the track border or pushing them into oil spills, which let the cars rotate uncontrollable for a short moment, resulting in a loss of valuable time. The levels are bigger as one screen, scrolling in all directions, with a horizontally split-screen in two-player mode.<br><br>The roads contain narrow curves, and some tracks include alternatives, which the player can choose which one to take. There is no career mode, each track has to be selected individually, and the goal is to win this individual level.<br><br>The are many options, you can disable the collisions, the AI controlled cars, the oil or the amount of   rounds required to finish a level.<br><br>An editor is included, allowing to design your own tracks, including checkpoints and obstacles. The created levels can be loaded and saved to disk.",
