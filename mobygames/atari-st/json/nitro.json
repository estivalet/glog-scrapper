  "description": "A racing game in which four cars - up to three of them can be controlled by players - complete for the first place in over 20 levels.<br><br>These levels are divided into four themes, and a few of them are played at night: Although it's hard enough to tell which way to go in the eight-way-scrolling maps during the day, you're sure to hit many barriers and walls at night when only your headlights give you any clues about where to go.<br><br>Depending on how well you raced, you'll get money to upgrade your car - and you'll also need to refuel your car! There are three types of cars to choose from, and depending on what kind of terrain a level is on, making the right choice here can give you the edge.",
