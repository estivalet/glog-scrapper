  "description": "<i>Cadenza Bog</i> is a word game in medium or high resolution for one player. You have to make words out of 16 letters that are selected at random (but the probability that a letter appears is directly proportional to to the number of times that it appears in the dictionary file). The letters are arranged in cubes in a 4 x 4 pattern. Words must be formed from adjacent cubes and no cube can be used more than once. Every Cube has at least three and at most eight adjacent cubes. <br><br>When you think you found all possible words press quit and see if the computer can beat you. A limitation is that the computer only can find words with at most six letters in them while a human player can find words with up to eight letters. The dictionary contains 2400 words, but it is possible to switch it with a larger one. The game is written in OSS Personal Pascal 2.0.\n",
