  "description": "Moonwalker is broken up into 4 levels. \nThe first level has you walking around avoiding fans trying to find parts of a rabbit costume needed to disguise yourself from your fans. You then need to find the waiting motorbike to escape to level 2 - Michaelsville.\nHere you need to find orbs which transform your bike into the glittering Stratus car able to leap barriers. If you get far enough you escape via a jetski.\nLevel 3 has you defending yourself in Club 30 against Mr Big's task force.\nAnd the final level has you in an arena fighting Mr Big's Storm Troopers and plasma cannon as Moonwalker himself - survive and save the children.",
