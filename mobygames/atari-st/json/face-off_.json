The player directly controls one of the five field athletes. The action button either initiates a shot (when in control of the puck) or a foul (when the opponent team is in control). When the action shifts near the own goal, the player also controls the diving movement of the goal keeper.<br><br>Besides a single match, the player can also compete in a cup tournament or a league, both with eight teams total. Other options which may be changed are the team colors, the team names, the length of a period (5, 10 or 20 minutes), the number of players (one or two) as well as one of four difficulty levels when playing against the AI.",
