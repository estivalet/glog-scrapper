The year is 1868 and you are close to the completion of your work into the human psyche. The game starts in your drawing room the night before Dr. Jekyll creates the potion that will transform him into Mr. Hyde.<br><br>The Spectrum version of the game is divided into three parts (Dichotomies, Duality, and Denouement) while the Atari version is just one long game. The goal of the first part is to mix up the potion that will transform you into Mr. Hyde. In part two, Mr. Hyde starts dominating over Dr. Jekyll, and in the last part, it is time to get rid of Mr. Hyde once and for all.<br><br>The Spectrum version was created using Professional Adventure Writer and the Atari version using STAC.",
