Genoce, a ruthless billionaire, has used his fortune to purchase key areas of the world. Now he is planning to take over the world with the aid of his army who were made redundant after the cold war. This must be stopped and that's why you are fighting.<br><br>As you fight your way through the islands you have to keep an eye on your ammo, armour and fuel meters.
