  "description": "In Superstar Ice Hockey you control one of 20 NHL teams. The game has no license so you can't play with the stars. There are 4 groups with 5 teams. After the regular season the best 2 teams of every group are qualified for the playoffs. Worth mentioning is that you are playing always the center - the other players are controlled by the CPU. In the multiplayer mode you can only play friendly games.",
