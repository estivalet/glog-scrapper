Once again you control Douglas Rockmoor and have to dig through caves and collect diamonds to get to the next level. You have to be careful of falling rocks, falling diamonds and monsters. Hitting monster with a rock kills them, hitting them with a diamond kills them and produces more diamonds. There are 24 levels in the game and every level has its own color scheme.",
