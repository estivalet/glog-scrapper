  "description": "Sega's take on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=1943\">1943</a> style of vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups was set in the future. Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes,  tanks and ground targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can't use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.",
