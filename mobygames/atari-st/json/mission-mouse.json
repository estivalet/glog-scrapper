  "description": "Mission Mouse is a platform game set in a maze spanning 25 separate rooms. You control Mickey, a mouse catcher who has been associating with mice so long that you are beginning to look like one. It is your job to catch 930 mice, while avoiding angry cats, owls, tin-men and other combatants, whose attacks will lose one of your five starting lives. You will also lose a life at the slightest touch against a vertical wall or a low roof, but can fall any distance without harm. Extra lives, represented by hearts, can be found scattered throughout the levels.<br><br>Mickey can move left and right, and jump. You can also do these things while bent low to the ground, allowing you to capture the mice in tight spaces. Despite being able to jump, Mickey tends to get between platforms by using elevators, or trampolines which provide much more sudden shift to the platform immediately above him. Police boxes appear on some screens, which allow Mickey to teleport to other more distant parts of the maze.",
