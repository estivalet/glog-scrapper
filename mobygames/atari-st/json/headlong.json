  "description": "<i>Headlong</i> is a game where you have to navigate a fast moving space ship through narrow passages.<br><br>The evil Magnaran people are planing to strip a rich planet of its resources and then destroy it. To stop their evil plan a skillful mercenary (the player) are hired to infiltrate their base on the moon Signus and destroy it with a fission bomb. Getting in was easy but when the ship breaks down the mercenary steals one of the Magnarans ships and it is now up to the player to get out of the base before the fission bomb goes off. The ship is armed with a laser so smaller walls can be shoot to pieces. Once the ship gets going there is no way to slow down. The player must escape from the enemy base before the time runs out (the bomb explodes) or he/she runs out of fuel.\n",
