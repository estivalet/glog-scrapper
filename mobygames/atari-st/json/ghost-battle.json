  "description": "<i>Ghost Battle</i> is one of the earlier games by the German company Thalion Software. Spanning five short yet difficult worlds, the game borrows its visual style heavily from its better-known contemporaries like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Shadow+of+the+Beast\">Shadow of the Beast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ghosts%e2%80%99n%e2%80%99Goblins\">Ghosts 'n' Goblins</a>.<br><br>A simple arcade-style action game with some rudimentary adventuring and timing based puzzles thrown in, <i>Ghost Battle</i> casts you as a nameless hero on a quest to rescue his, yet again, nameless girlfriend from a nameless bad guy. Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.",
