  "description": "Create a party of eight characters from the usual D&amp;D classes, and lead these characters on their quest for adventure.<br><br>The initial character development is fairly comprehensive, but the user interface for the game itself is a 2D top-down perspective with symbolic representations of everything. The game map is a simple grid with icons in various squares to denote the location of your characters, monsters, trees, etc. Combat takes place on a &quot;zoomed-in&quot; map of the same variety, and is turn-based.\n",
