  "description": "The protagonist of the game finds himself among the Breakers, an ancient race still harboring the hopes for a day when the Messiah would arrive and save the world. In a curious coincidence, according to their prophecies it turns out to be the very same day on which they encounter the protagonist. He must therefore convince them that he is indeed the Messiah, otherwise his return home and even his survival won't be guaranteed.<br><br><i>Breakers</i> is a text adventure game. The player interacts with the environment and converses with characters by typing commands and sentences. Similarly to other Synapse games, it has a real-time element. Characters may act regardless of the player's input, and some puzzles require the player to type commands within a time limit.",
