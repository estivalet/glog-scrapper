  "description": "<i>Conquest of Japan</i> is a strategy title in which the player must conquer their opponents' cities on the Island of Honshu in 16th century Japan. The ten cities must be occupied to win, which can be done by forming armies to defend their five cities and attack those of the opponents. When a city is taken, any mobile army that came from that city is automatically disbanded. In this way, potentially overwhelming forces can be routed by conquering their cities -- but only if the player can conquer the city before its army reaches its target. Depending on how the cities are located at the start of the game, players may find this to be a key part of their campaign strategy. When armies battle, the game switches from the strategic map to a tactical one. Formations, unit orders, and morale are factors in the tactical battles.",
