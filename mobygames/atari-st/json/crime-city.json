  "description": "<i>Crime City</i> is a classical point-and-click adventure. You play Mr. White, a poor chap who writes detective stories but wants nothing more than to be a real private investigator. It's a pretty classical story: one day, he can't really write a thing, but then, a mysterious blonde stands before his door, telling him his Father, Henry White, was arrested for murder. It's up to you to prove the police wrong.<br><br>A difference to the classical adventure exists: you need money to travel, get information or training. To get money, you can trade at the stock market. What's also different is that the time of the day really matters and that the protagonist becomes sleepy after staying up too long.",
