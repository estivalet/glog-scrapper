  "description": "<i>Celestial Ceasars</i> is a space strategy/combat game in medium resolution for 1-4 players. The aim of the game is to explore as much of the grid as possible and to control as many planets as possible. The player with the highest score will win. A game can consist of any number of turns between 10 and 25. The grid consists of 20x9 squares.<br><br>Every player starts with one planet and a small fleet. In every turn you may move every fleet one square (click on a fleet, then on the destination square and then decide how many ships to send there), if you end up on an enemy planet or enemy fleet a battle will take place after the movement phase. If a player retreats from battle he/she will lose 10% of the ships in the fleet and the remaining fleet will be withheld from play for between 1 and 4 turns. After the battle phase each planet builds it's allotted number of ships (home-worlds builds 15, neutral and captured planets builds 3-6 ships). After every fifth turn a status report is displayed. The score is computed as follows: 500/controlled planet, 50/explored square and 10/ship. ",
