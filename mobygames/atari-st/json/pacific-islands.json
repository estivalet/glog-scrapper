  "description": "Sequel to the 1990 bestseller game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/team-yankee\">Team Yankee</a>.<br><br>While using the same split screen interface as the predecessor, the game now features an enhanced graphics engine, showing the game world much more detailed as it has been shown in <i>Team Yankee</i>.<br><br>The game is still a mixture of a realistic tank simulation and a strategy wargame. Whereas the predecessor uses the story from the book, this game's story is fictional. A Soviet communist has occupied the Yama Yama Isles in the South Pacific which are an important strategic base in this area. You'll have to regain control of the islands in five missions.",
