  "description": "Microleague eschew action in favor of strategy for this licensed baseball game. The real-life teams and players are included, as well as classic teams from the past - lots of data disks were released featuring additional lineups. Each play is graphically shown, with a running commentary detailing how it unfolds.<br><br>A wide range of strategies are available. You can bring the stand-in players in, and instruct players as to how aggressively to play when opportunities arise, with 7 distinct batting strategies. When fielding you have options on field placement and bowling style - use the fastball and curveball wisely. Players will sometimes pick up injuries (the correct level of warming up can reduce this risk), or argue with the umpire over controversial decisions.",
