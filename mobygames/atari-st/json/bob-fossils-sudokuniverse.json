  "description": "Bob Fossill was promoted to the king of the Sudokuniverse, a land disordered by logical problems. His quest is to recreate order by rebuilding the land, which is done by defeating life forms by solving their puzzles. <em>Bob Fossil's Sudokuniverse</em> is a <em>Sudoku</em> implementation. A squared board of size 9x9 fields is divided into nine 3x3 blocks. In each block the numbers 1 to 9 must exactly appear one. But the same is true for each row and column of the 9x9 board. There are some unchangeable numbers on the board at the beginning.<br><br>The game features 20 levels, each with an unique solution. Each level is introduced with the life form to battle. On selecting a field, both row and column are highlighted, making the selection of correct numbers easier. In each field there are also small numbers from 1 to 9 which you can click and highlight as a hint for yourself.<br><br>For each level there is a separate high-score table.",
