  "description": "<i>The Pairs are Gone</i> is a puzzle game where you have to eliminate cards from the board. The cards must be eliminated pairwise and this can be done horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (gives most points). If you end up with cards that can't be removed you lose a life and when all lives are gone you lose the game. <br><br>The game consists of 25 levels and as you progress you will have to remove more and more cards and new cards will also show up.<br><br>The game is heavily inspired by one of the mini games in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/new-super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros</a>\n on the Nintendo DS. The DMA music is ripped from the N64 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mario-party\">Mario Party</a> and the graphics comes from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Zoo+Keeper\">Zoo Keeper</a>.
