  "description": "<i>Fall Gelb: The Fall of France</i> is a strategy game featuring Nazi Germany's 1940 invasion of France.<br><br>Designed for 1 - 2 players, each player controls the major land forces of either the Axis or Allied players. A computer opponent is available for 1-player games. The viewpoint is from a corps level commander, and the player assigns movement and combat tasks for those groups, and responds to operational events.<br><br>The game is text-only, and came with a board and physical pieces to allow the player to keep track of the location of theirs and enemy units. All games begin in on May 10, 1940, and game time lasts 10 - 20 turns, with each turn encompassing 2 days time.  Each break allows the player to input new commands for their forces, but will stop to allow the player to react to enemy movements. Each phase has an intelligence gathering component and a second component where troop orders can be given. \n Different nations will be taken out of the war based upon the progression of historical events.
