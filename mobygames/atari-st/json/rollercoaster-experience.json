  "description": "<i>The Rollercoaster Experience</i> is a puzzle game where you have to connect the beginning of a track with the end before a ball a ball starts to follow the track. The game consists of 100 levels.<br><br>When a level starts you get a number of different tiles to build a track from, you have to use all the pieces else you will lose the ball. If you have to build a track that requires more pieces than you were given at the beginning of the level you are free to move pieces that the ball have passed to new positions. You get extra bonus if you let the ball start rolling before the start timer reaches zero.",
