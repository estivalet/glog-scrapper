The game comes with two executable files -one for 520 K systems and one for 1 Meg systems. <br><br>The player controls Yaj and the aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds on every level (there is a total of 30 levels in the game) before the time runs out. Every level is a square the size of four screens. Monsters, pulsators and deadly skulls will try to stop the player in their quest and they have to be killed in order to complete the level. Monsters will follow Spud around the screen and can be killed using boulders. Pulsators always follows the walls and the will always turn left if they have to choose direction. To kill a pulsator you have to guide it into a trap where it will turn into a diamond. There can be up to 16 monsters and pulsators in a level (4 per screen). On their quest the player will also encounter various bonus items such as maps and watches and if they collect the letters B, O, N, U, S they will get a big bonus.<br><br>In some levels the player will encounter teleporters. They will take Yaj to another point in the level. There can be up to 16 teleporters in one level, but they can only be used once. Switch operated doors and blockades that appear from nowhere is also things that are new in Rockfall 3. <br><br>Rockfall 3 comes with a built-in level editor, a password and editor code system, and savable high score tables.",
