  "description": "&quot;Platonix Profi-Edition&quot; is an extended commercial version of the original <a id=\"da7817e68f9f22fe755b63f525135b296\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Platonix\">Platonix</a> public domain game. <br><br>You are some kind of wizard and you have to travel in a land of the fairy tales where you have to defeat the evil by collecting stones of wisdom in order to create a powerful spell and bundle the knowledge of human kind. Saving the world is practically done by solving puzzles. Those levels are divided into time zones, which does not affect gameplay, but graphics and music.<br><br>In-game you control a cursor and move over stones. On leaving a field, it vanishes and you cannot go back. A level is solved as soon as all stones are removed. Therefore the route moving over the stones have to be carefully planned to avoid later inaccessible stones. Often there are several possibilities to solve the level. Some maps are taken from the earlier free Atari ST game, but there are many new levels added to the “Profi Edition”, overall 100 levels are included.<br><br>There are several differences to the predecessor. Graphical wise, there is now variance in stone graphics – but only visually, there are no stones with special functions. By default the map is scrolling, keeping the player's cursor in the centre, which makes parts of the map invisible at times (this effect can be switched off in the options). Time limits are not so short like in the free game, but the player has to survive with only five lives instead of nine. A level password is now rewarded after each level. Overall playing speed is slower, for example you can not instantly restart the level on a button stroke if you are stucked, but have to watch and stop some animations first before re-entering the game.",
