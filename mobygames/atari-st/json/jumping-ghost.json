  "description": "<i>Jumping Ghost</i> is a one screen multilevel platform game where the aim of each level is to make it to the top of the screen. Every screen consists of seven lines with at least one hole in. These lines move across the screen from left to right or right to left and you have to make the ghost jump between lines to reach the top. The higher the level the more complex the pattern of holes in the lines will be and the faster the lines will move.",
