  "description": "<i>Sliders</i> is a simple futuristic sports game that isn't a world away from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,19/gameId,466/\">Marble Madness</a>. You control a ball over a futuristic landscape, the idea being to find the puck that's hidden somewhere in the level and &quot;herd&quot; it back to your starting point. Sounds simple enough, except for one thing; there's another player (either computer or human) trying to do the same thing.<br><br>This results in incredibly hectic gameplay. Add this to the fact that sometimes you're negatively charged to the puck (and thus kick it away) or positively charged (so the puck sticks to you) and you're in for a crazy time!",
