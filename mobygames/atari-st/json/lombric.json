  "description": "<em>Lombric</em> is a Tron-like game inspired by the 1998 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Viper\">Viper</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Eclipse\">Eclipse</a>. In this snake-like game up to three human players move their snake-head across the level keeping a trail of their previous route behind them. A collision with either the own tail, the tail of another player or any obstacle in the level kills the player. That player last-standing wins the round. The obstacles and starting positions are randomly placed at the start of each level.<br><br>The amount of blocks (obstacles), the amount of players and the speed of the head moving can be manually configured.",
