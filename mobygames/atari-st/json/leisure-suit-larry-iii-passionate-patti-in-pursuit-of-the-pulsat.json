  "description": "<i>Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals!</i> is the third game in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Al+Lowe\">Al Lowe's</a> <i>Leisure Suit Larry</i> series. Larry Laffer has finally found the woman of his dreams, and can happily live with her together on the beautiful tropical island... until he gets thrown out of the house by his wife. His boss, who happens to be his (now ex-) father-in-law, fires him. Larry is all alone, without a woman, without a job, on an island that has long ceased to be a &quot;tropical paradise&quot; and is exploited by entertainers, lawyers, and alike. But never despair! Dressed in his irresistible leisure suit, Larry is about to conquer the world (or at least its female population) anew. Watch out, fairer sex, because Larry is back to his swinging self!<br><br>The game uses the same text-based interface and the same graphical engine as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/leisure-suit-larry-goes-looking-for-love-in-several-wrong-places\">previous entry</a> in the series. The structure of the game, however, is more similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Leisure+Suit+Larry%3a+In+the+Land+of+the+Lounge+Lizards\">first installment</a>: most of the time, the player is confined to one large area which can be freely explored. Unlike the two previous Larry games, the player does not just control Larry, but also - in the second half of the game - the enigmatic and beautiful pianist Patti, helping them to reach an ending that will finally bring happiness into Larry's life.",
