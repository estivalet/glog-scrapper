  "description": "<i>The Blag</i> is an adventure game created with STAC. You take on the roll of Detective Constable Adrian Blunder newly transferred to the small British village Woolendon. Woolendon is a lovely place to live if you are after the \nquiet way of life, but that was exactly what Blunder didn't want. He wanted crime and plenty of it. By the end of his first day in Woolendon things changes and he finds himself investigating a bank robbery.<br><br>The game attempts to follow the line of a police investigation of a serious crime at a quiet town, right through to \nthe eventual trial of the accused. When you think that you have conducted a sufficient investigation type court at the prompt to see how the trial goes. One can say that the game consists of two parts mixed together: exploring and questioning. In exploring mode you walk, drive, look, pick up things etc like in any other text adventure. The questioning mode is invoked by the ask command and can be used when you encounter a villager. When you think you have finished the questioning just type thanks to return to exploring mode.",
