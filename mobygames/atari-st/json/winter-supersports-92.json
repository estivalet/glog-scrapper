  "description": "<i>Winter Supersports 92</i> is a sports game with eight events from the Winter Olympiad. The basic goal is to participate in all events in a row (events can be deselected, though) and the player with the most points is the winner. If multiple players participate, two of them are playing at the same time on a split-screen. Then the next batch of two starts.\n<ul><li>Downhill Skiing, Giant Slalom, Pro Ski Challenge are downhill courses in which the player has to circuit obstacles.</li>\n<li>The Bale Jumping and Speed Skating events require the player to alternate pressing left and right while keeping a rhythm.</li>\n<li>Bobsled and Luge are also similar to each other: the athletes are shown from behind and the player has to steer the bob/luge. The bob additionally has a brake.</li>\n<li>Skidoo Racing consists of a top-down course which needs to be completed as fast as possible. Only a part of the course is shown at a time; the screen scrolls.</li></ul>",
