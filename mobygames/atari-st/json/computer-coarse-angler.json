  "description": "<i>Coarse Angler</i> is a one player fishing simulator written in STOS. The idea with the game is to provide an amusement for seasoned anglers and a good introduction to coarse fishing for the beginner.<br><br>From the games main menu you may select to practice, play a match or specimen hunt. There are 12 locations to fish from in the game. Among the locations are a river, a pond and a canal. If you choose to practice you may fish at any of the locations, during a match however, you are given a location. During specimen hunt you are only suppose to catch one given type of fish.<br><br>The in-game screen is split in two main parts: the fishing view to the left and the equipment window to the right. You have a plethora of equipment to experiment with, such as 10 hook sizes, four rod types and so on. As bait you may use maggots, luncheon meat, bread and so on. A log keeps track of your catches and records, etc.",
