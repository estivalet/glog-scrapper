  "description": "Ant, duck, flower and snake are trapped at the bottom of some platforms. In the arcade game <em>Bunion Canyon</em> up to four players take one of the characters and try to reach the highest platform. The platforms are moving horizontally and at certain positions there are holes, and often those holes are changing in size during the move. Any of the four avatars can move left and right and jump. If jumping is timed perfectly a higher platform can be reached by jumping through a hole. But beware: you fall down if a hole in your current platform is moving under your feet. In that situation it helps you can run out of the left or right border and re-enter on the opposite side.<br><br>As the plain jumping challenge would not be enough, the gods added blue pills, randomly appearing in the levels. Those grant one of four powers to the collector, like a wind to throw opponent players away or to lock them down temporarily. Also, in most levels a hammer is marauding, disabling any player it touches. Disabled players also fall through holes down.<br><br><em>Bunion Canyon</em> is always played with four competitors, but the computer can control any amount of them (even four). The amount of rounds to win for an overall win can be manually configured.",
