  "description": "As knight of the realm, King Littré the First entrust a mission to you to ensure that French is well written in all provinces of his kingdom. Indeed, a grammar book was written by enchanter Grévisse, but the machiavellian sorcerer Errare locked the enchanter in a maze, hid the grammar book in its treasure and cursed all the copyists, who make pages full of mistakes. Your mission is to rescue everyone, identify mistakes and destroy the wrong pages, save the copyists and find the 4 keys that will lead to treasure and grammar book.<br><br>Ingame, you must move your hero through the maze and enter the rooms that come to you to answer questions about French grammar or fight the minions of sorcerer Errare. Your moves are made between static displays in a third-person view or, more rarely, a first-person one. Each intersection results in a choice of a direction or action similarly to &quot;a thrilling fantasy adventure in which YOU are the hero&quot;. Puzzles are based on multiple choice questions. You will gain some magic items and letters, but errors will lead to loss of hit points, which will make you more vulnerable in future battles. Encounters with the monsters take place suddenly and automatically, and only the comparison between your health and the one of your opponents will determine the winner of the fight. If defeated, you will die and have to restart the game from the beginning. After defeating Errare, your only chance to open treasure and free the grammar book is to find the correct password, so be sure to collect enough magic letters to reconstruct the password before starting the final fight!<br><br>Le Labyrinthe d'Errare aims 11-14 year-old children and is part of a larger series of games &quot;Labyrithe&quot; by Dominique Grandpierre, on every possible subjects. Its strict equivalent for 8-10 year-old children is called &quot;Le Labyrithe d'Orthopus&quot;.",
