  "description": "<i>Rockfall 2 - The Perils of Spud</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> clone and sequel to <a id=\"d98e3c1fd0dde8899c0631592ff744455\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Rockfall\">Rockfall</a>. You control Spud and the aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds on every level before the time runs out. Before you start a new level you will see a map of the level and various bits of information about the level. As you dig and collect diamonds you have to be careful of boulders, because they will only stay still on flat surfaces and once they fall you cannot out run them. Monsters and pulsators will try to stop you in your quest and they have to be killed in order to complete the level. Monsters will follow Spud around the screen and can be killed using boulders. Pulsators always follows the walls and the will always turn left if they have to choose direction. To kill a pulsator you have to guide it into a trap where it will turn into a diamond. <br><br>In some levels you will encounter teleporters. They will teleport Spud to another position in the level, but they can only be used once. All teleporters must be used before a level can be completed.<br><br>A password system lets you start on any level you visited so far. Rockfall 2 also comes with a built in level editor (a included level can be edited once you have completed it and received it's editor code). Each set of levels have their own high score list which is saved to disc. 2 sets of levels are included with the game, representing a total of 90 levels. The default set is completely new, unlike the other set which is based on those levels which came with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rockfall-special-edition\">Rockfall Special Edition</a>.
