  "description": "Viewed isometrically, this role-playing game saw you leading a party of four intrepid souls on a mission to restore peace to the land. Sixteen levels awaited them, all filled with traps and monsters. Spells could be collected as the game went on, and multiple ones cast in quick succession. The characters could be split, and sent off on different routes and tasks to save time.<br><br>The game’s title was inspired by its innovative use of light, or rather of darkness. Nothing could be seen without the torches your characters had; these meant that vision faded outside their circular arc. You had to manoeuvre the torch around to reveal secret areas, and it could be used to ward off some monsters, although it alerted others to your presence.\n",
