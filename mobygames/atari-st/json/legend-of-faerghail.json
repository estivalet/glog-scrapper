  "description": "Something bad has happened to the race of elves. Without provocation, they attack innocent people and are preparing to conquer the peaceful city of Thyn. The Count of Thyn needs somebody to go to the city of Cyldane and ask the local Count to send reinforcements. This task is given to the protagonist of the game, who has to recruit other adventurers to help him in dangerous battles. Soon the heroes will discover a greater evil behind the sudden insanity that plagues the elves, and will have to find a way to defeat it...<br><br><i>Legend of Faerghail</i> is a role-playing game with an interface similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Bard%27s+Tale\"> The Bard's Tale series</a>. The player explores towns, wilderness, and complex dungeons of the game from first-person perspective, fighting enemies in turn-based combat. The combat system requires the player to pay attention to the position of the characters in battle. For example, a mage will lose concentration and fail at spellcasting if he stands too close to the enemy.",
