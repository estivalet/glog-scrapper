  "description": "<i>Slippery Sid</i> is a nine level snake game. In every level the player has to help Sid collect 30 pieces of green food before the time runs out so that he may advance to the next level. For every piece of food Sid eats he grows a bit. Sid also suffers from a skin decease so that he now and then sheds a bit of dead skin (colored red). If Sid touches one these pieces of dead skin he loses a life. A built in cheat mode allows the player to alter Sids size, speed, the number of lives and starting level.<br><br>The game was written in STOS.",
