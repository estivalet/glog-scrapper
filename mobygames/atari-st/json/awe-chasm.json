  "description": "In <i>The Awe-Chasm</i>, the player takes the role of Snatch and Crunch which visit the Awe-Chasm in search for treasure. And that is also the whole extend of the background story: the goal is simply to find all treasure and earn all 500 points.<br><br>In order to solve puzzles, the player writes sentences into the parser. The player can switch between the two characters which have different abilities (Crunch is a &quot;monolithic mutant&quot; and Snatch a &quot;pokey pervert&quot;) and can interact, e.g. Crunch can pick up Snatch. This is required to solve some puzzles. The game features sexual humour.",
