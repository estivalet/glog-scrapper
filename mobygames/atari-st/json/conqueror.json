  "description": "<i>Conqueror</i> is a polygonal isometric-view tank action/strategy game with an elaborate control system (emulating &quot;real&quot; tank controls on normal joysticks) and two-player possibilities by switching the controls to use one joystick each for gunner and driver.\nThe goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on.\nTo top things off, there is also a limited amount of resources allocated to the player that can be gained by destroying enemies; these resources can then be used to buy new tanks before the start of the next mission.",
