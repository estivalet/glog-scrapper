  "description": "<i>Crazy Cubes</i> is a labyrinth game for high resolution where you have to guide two or more balls to the exit.\nEvery level is made up of several different tiles; there are walls that are impassable, tiles that stops your ball and only allows it to leave the tile in a given direction, bombs, mirrors, tiles that gives bonus points and the lightning tile that can do several things (like make one ball disappear or create a bomb). You control the balls with the joystick. When you want to move the balls you have to press the fire button, else they wont move. Every level has a time limit and if you don't complete the level in that time it's game over.<br><br>At given points you will face qualifying games, that if successfully completed allows you to continue to play. You may choose between &quot;entering&quot; the arcade and play one of three qualifying games (Asteroids, Formula 1 or Lunar) or take a three question quiz with questions such as who was singer in X.",
