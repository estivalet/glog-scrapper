  "description": "<i>ABC Jumble</i> is a game in high resolution for kids where you have to order the letters in the alphabet. When you are done and all letters are in order you get to see how many moves you did it in. Help is given in two ways: by playing the alphabet song and lighting up the corresponding letter and by a help screen that shows the letters in alphabetical order.\n",
