  "description": "<i>Don't worry be happy</i> is a shareware conversion of the German board game <em>Mensch ärgere Dich nicht!</em> (which is very similar to the English board game <em>Ludo</em>, as both are variants of the Indian <em>Pachisi</em> game).<br><br>Two to four players race the board to finally enter their home with all four figures. Movement is done via a dice roll, with the difficulty you require a six to leave your starting area. If a figure enters a field with a figure of an opposite player on it, the player can throw this figure, basically sending it back to the starting point of the player.<br><br>The game features up to three AI players, but can also played with four humans.",
