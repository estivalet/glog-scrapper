  "description": "<i>Fast Lane!</i> is a racing game, simulating the C-1 championship. It has nine tracks, including Horama, Le Mans, Suzuka and Donnington. There is a practice mode in which you can get used to the gears, which can also be set to auto transmission. Many options on the car can be tweaked, for example the angle of the front and rear spoilers, the tires and more. A detailed damage model can be shown and also fuel settings can be changed (you can reduce the amount of fuel in the tank).<br><br>Before a race you have to qualify by getting a good time during three rounds on the empty racing track. Depending on the qualifying time you start in the field. The graphics are displayed with zooming sprites, and the track is not flat, but features some hills that limit the view of the further road. Despite the car options, this game is not a real simulation but plays like an arcade racer.\n",
