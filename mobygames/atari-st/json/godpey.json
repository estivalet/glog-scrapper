  "description": "<i>Godpey</i>, a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gunpey\">Gunpey</a>, is all about lines. On a playfield filled with squares, tiles with diagonal and angled lines pop up from below, and it is your job to make a connection from the left to the right by moving the tiles so that the lines with their different angles connect. Moving tiles is done by moving a cursor, two tiles high, which will swap out the two tiles it is covering.<br><br>The actual story of Godpey is about a poor monkey who has lost all his vegetables. After rejecting the idea of making vegetables out of Alan Titchmarsh, he comes to the conclusion that drawing lines will somehow take him to his veggies.<br><br><i>Godpey</i> features a lot of gameplay modes, unlocked by gathering experience points. While the most basic mode is just about simple connecting for as long as you can stand it, the next mode adds a stress elements since no tile must ever be pushed off the playfield. In other modes, you play against time for points, or are presented with screens already filled with tiles that you must arrange into one big branching line involving each and every tile. The final mode is the story mode, which tells the story of the monkey in pretty cut-scenes. As you level up, the monkey is adorned with a new vegetable-themed hat.<br><br><i>Godpey</i> can be played alone, against a friend or against the computer.",
