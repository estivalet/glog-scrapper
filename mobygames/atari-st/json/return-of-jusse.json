  "description": "<i>The Return of Jusse</i> is a game set on the planet Vainox where you have to rescue survivors from a disaster.<br><br>Jusse have returned to planet Vainox to warn the inhabitants of the city Zelus-5 about a virus cloud heading their way. At the same time he also tells them how to protect themselves from the lethal virus. Unfortunately only eight persons listened to Jusse and took shelter in protective cocoons. You now have to find and collect these 8 cocoons and return them to your mother ship before the time runs out. You can only carry one cocoon at a time so you have to move quickly to collect them all.<br><br>You control your lander type ship by firing its thrusters so that you avoid contact with both ground and other obstacles, you have infinite fuel so you don't have to worry about running out of it. Use the laser to destroy sentinels and steel doors and use the grab to collect the cocoons. If the ship comes in contact with anything else than the cocoons you it will lose shield energy; to recharge the shield you have to dock with the mother ship.",
