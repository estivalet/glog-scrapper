  "description": "<em>Mortar</em> is an <em>Artillery</em> variant and the authors name the inspiration in games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/ballerburg\">Ballerburg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/scorched-earth\">Scorched Earth</a>.<br><br>Two player are controlling an cannon at opposing ends of a level in an randomly created landscape with hills and valleys. The goal is to destroy the opponent player by hitting the cannon. Each turn each player has a single shot and can set the strength of the shot and the angle of the cannon. If the shot is hitting the landscape, if creates a crate, if it hits one of the cannons, it drains energy. If the energy of one player is reaching zero, the round is finished. Mind the wind, which affects all weapon types.<br><br>During the round extra weapons and upgrades can be bought: ammunition with double explosion size, shots bouncing twice before explode, ammunition which rolls on the ground and other types affecting the flying behavior. A shield is active on both cannons and, depending on the weapon type, the angle of maximum damage is different.",
