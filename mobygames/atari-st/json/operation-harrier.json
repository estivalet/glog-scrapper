  "description": "<i>Operation Harrier</i> is an action game starring Britain's famous VTOL aircraft. It uses an enhanced version of the <i>Rotoscape</i> system first used in Creative Materials' earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rotox\">Rotox</a>: the own plane is seen from the top and when steering left or right the polygonally rendered background rotates around it. A new addition is the ability to change altitude. <br><br>The game consists of several missions, each with a specific goal like destroying an enemy cruiser or power plant or defending an airfield from enemy fighters. Before a mission, the Harrier can be armed with a variety of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles as well as two types of bombs. Standard armament is a forward-firing cannon with unlimited ammunition. A radar screen and a map help finding the enemy during a mission. Fuel is limited, but in some missions in-air refueling is possible. While the Harrier can survive a few hits, it can also be repaired (and refueled) after mission's end. Sometimes it is also possible to make a mid-mission resupply landing at a friendly base.",
