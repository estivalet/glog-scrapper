  "description": "Your home solar system of 15 planets has been attacked by a horde of Super Dreadnoughts, from a race who wish to harvest your universe's minerals for their own use.<br><br>You must pilot your craft through some of the hardest levels ever created, shoot down enemy space craft and ground weapons, and avoid the many indestructible hazards.  When a sufficient number of enemies have been defeated the player can then land on the Dreadnought and proceed to destroy the ship's reactor.<br><br>The innovation is that you do not simply travel in a single direction, but instead move from left to right or right to left depending on where the current targets are, in a manner more similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Defender\">Defender</a> than most shoot 'em ups.",
