  "description": "<i>Skull-Diggery</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a>-clone for medium resolution. As in the original game you have to collect a certain number of gems in each level to complete it. As you dig your way to the gems you have to be careful so that you don't get crushed by a skull. In some levels there are monsters, if you hit a monster with a skull it will explode and destroy anything within 3x3 square, this can be used to open up walls to sealed gem rooms. Sometimes you have to convert skulls to gems to get enough of them to complete the level.",
