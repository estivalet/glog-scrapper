  "description": "<em>Stupid Balloon</em> is an arcade game inspired by the coin-op <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/crazy-balloon___\">Crazy Balloon</a> from 1980. You control a balloon moving through a underground maze, desired to collect all stars in a room. Accelerating the balloon gives it an impulse and it will not instantly stop, which makes navigation tricky. Any contact with the walls will blow your balloon and a life is lost. As if the navigation would not be difficult enough, there is also a strict time limit for collecting the stars. The player has three lives. If loosing a life, the collected stars are now respawned, but the time limit is not reset completely.<br><br>The game was created during a 24-hour game creation competition at the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Reservoid+Gods\">Reservoir God</a>'s Cwmvention party in 1998.",
