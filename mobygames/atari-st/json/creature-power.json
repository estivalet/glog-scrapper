  "description": "<em>Creature Power</em> is kind of a puzzle game. The player's job is to reach a jewel hidden deep in the sea by transforming into several animals.<br><br>But before that can be done, you have to qualify in a sub-game: the &quot;Creature Power Frog Race&quot;. There are always two frogs competing  and over three laps they randomly move forward (no user interaction is required or possible).<br><br>The winner of the race is allowed to enter the &quot;Creature Power&quot; part of the game. In a guessing game you are confronted with situation which you have to solve by transforming in a certain animal. In most cases, those picks end miserably (e.g. you pick the eel to swim, and get instantly eaten by a shark). For all the picks to finally reach the jewel you only have a limited amount of time. If an animal dies during your choices, you have to start again in the Frog Race.",
