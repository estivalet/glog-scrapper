  "description": "<em>Mafia 2: The Game</em> is the successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/mafia-the-game\">Mafia: The Game</a>. As in the original game, your goal is to become the local don in the criminal underground of a simulated city. In this trading simulation you can do some legal business, like trading houses, but you can also build drug labs into those houses, produce a lot of cocaine and hire some dealers to sell your stuff.<br><br>The second <em>Mafia</em> game overhauls the user interface completely and is adding some new features, but the major part of the game remains like in the former game. A central office allows you now manage your employees. It is also the place new messages arrive, like you lost money on horse bets. You now have four direct opponents and between each turn you get information about their actions. You can hire informants to get more detailed information. Income from drug production and your dealers work on spreading those is now more clear. ",
