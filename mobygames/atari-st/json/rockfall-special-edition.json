You control Spud and aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds on every level before the time runs out.

There can be up to 4 of each in a level. Both monsters and pulsators has to be disposed of in one way or another. Monsters walks randomly in the level while pulsators always follows the walls and the will always turn left if they have to choose direction. Monsters can be killed using boulders while you need to use traps to kill pulsators.
