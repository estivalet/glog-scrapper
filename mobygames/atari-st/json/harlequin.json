  "description": "Harlequin grew up living in Chimerica - paradise for any inquisitive child with its vast acres of surprise. When he left it to find a more challenging and mature world, it gradually withered away, and its many inhabiting creatures turned nasty. Harlequin must return to neutralise them.<br><br>He does this by firing hearts of love at them, as contact with any of them is fatal. The gameplay is platform-based, with lots of vertical ascents to be made, and features lots of bonuses and hidden sections.",
