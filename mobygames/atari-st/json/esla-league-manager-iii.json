  "description": "<em>ESLA League Manager III</em> is the final game in the series of German football managing games. For the first time in the series, the game is not only available in German, but also translated to English. Like in the predecessors, up to four players can manage a club in the first four leagues, participating in league and cup competitions (national and international).<br><br>The graphical interface is much more colorful and more detailed information about player and team performance are shown, and the options to tweak the gameplay allow a finer control like in the former two games. For example you can set specific starting settings for your team and conditions for winning and loosing the game, like disabling the sacking because of debts, as well as the strength of leagues. You can choose the nation you want to play the leagues in, which is modifying player generation. Like in <em>Spitzenreiter 2</em>, the clubs are fantasy ones, but now they are assigned to a city, so now Liverpool is playing against Manchester, even if the clubs are called &quot;Rebels Liverpool&quot; and &quot;Mjöllnir Manchester&quot;. For single matches, tactical formations can be set, you can set a motivation level for the game, bribe the referee or set an extra bonus for the players. Also, the training options are extended, you can either set the pre-season training schedule for six weeks and during the season the training for a single week. Games are still presented as series of the events like goals, but after the match a finer analyses of the game including individual ranks for each player, is shown. On the transfer market you can strengthen your team by buying new players or negotiate the contracts of the players of your squad.",
