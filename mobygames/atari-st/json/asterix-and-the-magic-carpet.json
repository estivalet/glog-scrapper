But during the travel he lost his voice. Now Asterix and Obelix have to find the cure for Cacofonix' voice and rescue Princess Orinjade, who will be sacrificed by evil Hoodunnit if it isn't raining.<br><br>During the game you watch the static cartoon scenes and choose the answers to progress in your travel. Sometimes you need an action, so it is action sequences in the game, for example, to defend the village from the robbers, etc.",
