  "description": "<i>Plumb Crazy</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Pipe+Dream\">Pipe Dream</a> clone written in STOS. <br><br>Construct a large enough network of pipes before the time runs out and the water starts to flow. The construction area consists of 9 x 6 tiles with one tile already occupied by the inflow pipe. At the bottom of the screen is the time indicator and once it is full the construction time is up and water starts to flow into the pipe network. At the top right corner of the screen is a number which shows how large the network needs to be to complete the level and at the lower right side of the screen the next four pipe segments are displayed. If the player don't manage to construct a network that's large enough it's game over. From level three special pipes starts to appear (such as one way pipes).",
