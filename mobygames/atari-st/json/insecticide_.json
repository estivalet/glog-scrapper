  "description": "<em>Insecticide</em> is a shooting game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/centipede_\">Centipede</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/robotron-2084\">Robotron</a>. During winter time, insects are bored and playing &quot;Insecticide&quot;, and the player has to compete in their competition. Playing a ladybird, you have to hunt ants, bugs and other insects. Your ladybird starts at the bottom of the screen and can move into four directions, and also shooting in the direction currently walking. The levels are single screens, and beside moving enemies, there are static obstacles of insects still in winter sleep.<br><br>The levels are single screens, with the enemies moving towards you. Shooting at static obstacles may reward bonus points or the &quot;Bouncer&quot;, a bullet moving constantly and bouncing of the walls, crushing any opponent in it's way. After each eight levels, a boss fight has to be done against a bigger bug. On contact with the enemies or getting hit by one of their shots, the ladybug looses some energy. On loosing a life, the game must be restarted from some levels earlier. On collecting enough points, a high-score table can be reached, which is persisted to disk.",
