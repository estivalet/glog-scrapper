  "description": "<i>Mc Coy</i> is a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dr-mario\">Dr. Mario</a>, without Mario and running in a GEM window. <br><br>The objective is the same as in the original – take the falling pills with two different colours, twist and arrange them until you form lines of four pills of the same colour. To complicate things, the playfield has got some viruses, which must be eliminated using pills of the same colour. Once all the viruses are eliminated, the level is clear.",
