  "description": "<i>Chessnut</i> is a chess game for 0 to 2 players. The game can be played at 9 different levels from 1 to 9. The number represents width of the search (but not the depth which is always 5) that the computer makes before each move. Moves are done by the player by entering the move in algebraic notation, for example: A2-A4. The game board can be seen both from an isometric point of view and from above and the game features several graphic options which makes the game a bit more colorful.",
