  "description": "<i>Seventh Heaven</i> is a text adventure created in STAC.\nYou play a man who four years ago was diagnosed with an terminal illness. The doctor told you that you had at most five years left to live. After two nervous breakdowns and a suicide attempt you got locked up in a secure psychiatric ward. During recreation periods in the garden you used to sleep on a bench and there you dreamt dreams, dreams that hinted of a promise. The dreams told you about the astral plane. <br><br>Every time you sleep on the bench you travel to the astral plane. The astral plane is divided into seven levels and at the start of the game you only have access to the first level. To gain access to a new level you have to complete a specific task. On the seventh level you'll find the cure for your illness.\n",
