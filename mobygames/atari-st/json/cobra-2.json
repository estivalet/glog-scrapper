  "description": "Dominique, that careless girl, has been kidnapped again, and naturally it is up to Cobra and his mechanical mate, Lady, to rescue her.<br><br>Cobra II plays almost exactly as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/thomson-to/cobra_\">the previous game</a>, only with new level layouts and slightly more rich gameplay. The isometric playfield is the same, and even the border decorations are the same. You control both Cobra and Lady, though optionally a second player may take control of Lady. You still shoot anything that moves, and have a stockpile of smart bombs to destroy anything that you failed to shoot. A star moves around the corners of the screen; follow it to find the exit to the next level. A new feature is that sessions can be saved and loaded at any point.",
