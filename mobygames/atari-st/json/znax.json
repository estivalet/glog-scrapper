  "description": "<em>Znax</em> is a puzzle game. On a 10x10 board there are stones in four different colors. The goal is to remove rectangular areas by marking four corners of the same color. It is not required that the area spanning under those points is of the same color, too. Once a rectangle is selected, the complete area is replaced with random stones. The bigger the rectangle, the more points you receive.<br><br>There are two playing modes giving you 2 or 5 minutes or playing time. Separate high-score tables are present for each of the modes.",
