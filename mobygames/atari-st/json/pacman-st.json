  "description": "<i>Pacman ST</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pacman\">Pacman</a> clone with two game modes and two speed settings. As in the original game the player must eat all of the small yellow dots to complete the current level. The player must avoid the ghosts that tries to catch Pacman, touching a ghost means losing a life. Eating the bigger yellow dots makes the ghosts edible for a short while. If the player eats an edible ghost extra points is awarded. Now and then bonus items will appear in the middle of the level, these awards the player with extra point if eaten. Playing in classic mode shows the game area with traditional graphics, in modern mode the level graphics have been overhauled. Setting the speed to hectic gives the player an extra challenge since everything moves faster in that mode. ",
