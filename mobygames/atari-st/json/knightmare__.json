  "description": "A team of adventurers seek out four magic objects in the dungeons of Dunshelm: The Shield of Justice, the Sword of Freedom, the Cup of Life and the Crown of Glory. Equipped with these, they hope to destroy the evil Lord Fear. Treguard, the dungeon master of the Knightmare castle, appears as an oracle to help in their quest.<br><br><i>Knightmare</i> is a role-playing game and the second videogame adaptation of the homonymous British television series. It is very similar to the games of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/captive-series\">Captive series</a>, as it was developed by the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,97124/\">author</a>. As in those games the interface is mouse-based, clearly inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dungeon-master\">Dungeon Master</a> one: the left mouse-button interacts with the environment, while the right button executes character actions. Movement can be controlled by left-clicking on the movement buttons on the screen or by using the keyboard. Once a weapon or an object is equipped, clicking on it brings up a menu with its actions. Knives, for example, have a menu with &quot;stab&quot;, &quot;swing&quot; and &quot;hack&quot;. A empty hand shows a menu with &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;kick&quot;. The wand shows a list of available spells.<br><br>The game allows saving at any moment, but only loads saved games through the start menu. This means that in order to load a saved game, the player has to reset the game or intentionally kill the party.",
