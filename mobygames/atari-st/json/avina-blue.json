  "description": "<i>Avina Blue</i> is a shoot'em-up written in 68000 assembler.<br><br>Many hundred years from the computer revolution of the late 1900's software companies operates from huge satellite moons and the human spirit is almost dead. The Ego Mind rules everything and it destroys and represses any threats.  A small band of programmers operating through the name of Budgie UK have found and reclaimed some long lost spirit of creativity and programming magic. But since the Ego Mind sees this as a threat it is developing a counter measure inside an orbiting software satellite known as Avina Blue. The game that the Ego Mind develops is so powerful it will turn mankind into a race of zombies. It is your job to pilot a small spaceship inside Avina Blue and destroy the threat to mankind.<br><br>This game is similar to Chris Skellern's earlier game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Runaway\">Runaway</a> in that you guide a space ship at high speed through narrow passages. Unlike his earlier game this one is side-scrolling, there is plenty of enemies and you can shoot them. You have 12 lives at the beginning.",
