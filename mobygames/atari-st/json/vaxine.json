  "description": "In this first person driver/shooter, the player must protect a body's base cells from attack by evil infecting cells.  The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection.  The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases.  You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them.  Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed.  The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition.  Run out of a color and the game is over.  The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.",
