  "description": "The exploration space vessel &quot;DARWIN 8&quot; is in troubles: it is invaded by alien robots, who killed the whole crew, leaving the player as last survivor to fight the intruders and clear the ship.<br><br>The player blasts his way through 40 levels shooting robots. But there is a problem: the robots are protected by &quot;positronic generators&quot;, which have to be destroyed before the moving robots are receiving damage from your weapon. With active generators, a hit with the weapon only stuns them for a very short time. In each level there is at least one of those generators, in others there are up to three. Clearing a level fast awards you with extra points depending on the time remaining, while running out of time is punished with a life loss.<br><br>The levels are presented as single screens, with deadly walls in them: touching a stone instantly kills the player, which is also happening on a single hit from any of the robots shots. The level maps are pre-defined and always the same, but on each level start or dying, the position of both the robots and generator are randomly chosen. After each seven levels, the player gains an extra life.<br><br>The game was published as cover disk for ST Format, but released into the public domain soon after. In 2010 an extended port with original graphics was released, named <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/robotz-dx\">Robotz DX</a>.",
