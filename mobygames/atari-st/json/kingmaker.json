  "description": "Based on Avalon Hill's board game of the same name, Kingmaker is a strategy game set during the War of the Roses period of medieval England. You can play either York, or Lancaster, and your goal is to get your choice for royal heir crowned king of England. You do this by granting titles to people favorable to your cause, and eliminating those who would oppose it. Kingmaker has a simplistic combat interface, rather concentrating on politics and dirty tricks as the strategies of choice.",
