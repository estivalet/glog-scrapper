These had previously been released for some but not all of these systems.<br><br><i>Silicon Dreams</i> can be played as three separate games, but to obtain the maximum number of points, you must complete them in order (carrying your score from one adventure to the next). <i>Snowball</i> has graphics for the first time, and the other two games have more graphics than before, and some longer text descriptions are added to all 3 games.<br><br><b>Snowball:</b> As Kim Kimberley, your mission is to safeguard the colonization ship Snowball 9 and its passengers. When you are awakened prematurely from hibernation, you know something's wrong!<br><br><b>Return to Eden:</b> Your objective is to get into the new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.<br><br><b>Worm in Paradise:</b> You have to find as much information about the city as possible, obtain money, and then become a member of the governing party of Eden.",
