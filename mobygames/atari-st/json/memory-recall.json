  "description": "<em>Memory recall</em> is a game to train your memory. There are twenty tiles on a board of size 4x5. Like in the board game <em>Memory</em> behind each tile/card an image is hidden. But unlike the board game, you do not have to find pairs, but got commands to find a certain image.<br><br>There are two phases in the game: first you can freely explore the images and memorize them. Then in the bonus phase you get an request like &quot;Find a tiger&quot; and you get a higher score for finding it quicker with fewer turns. There are five difficulty levels. In the higher levels, you have shorter time to explore the cards freely and in the lower difficulties you also get information if the tile you turned is in the same column and row like the requested one.<br><br>There are 20 digitized pictures in the game, and a high-score table for each of the difficulty levels.",
