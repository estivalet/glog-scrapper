  "description": "In <i>Mission Deadzone</i> the player controls a hovership and navigates caves in search of stranded scientists. The player starts with three ships and a full energy bar. The energy bar decreases over time and if the player is hit by fire. Energy platforms spread out through the caves can be used to fill up the energy bar. Here and there in the caves the player will be faced with passages blocked by energy beams. These beams can be switched off by firing at blue switches (these will then turned red). Firing at a switch will give the player 50 points, rescuing a scientist will give the player 100 points. At the end of each cave there is an end of level boss. Defeating this boss reveals a teleport that will take the player to the next cave.\n",
