  "description": "<i>Sky Fighter</i> is a vertically scrolling shooter without plot; the goal simply being to survive all levels and get a high score. The player controls a space ship which is attacked by various flying enemies and ground bases; he can defend himself either by using the standard attack or one of the limited bombs. <br><br>The ship can take up to nine hits (one life) and needs regular refueling by hitting an energy tank with a bomb, which are automatically refilled at the end of the level. A speciality is the memory test after every level: the player needs to remember which enemy typed were on the level's ground stations - the rewards for a correct guess are more bombs and a point bonus.",
