  "description": "The closest comparison to this action game would be <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Afterburner\">Afterburner</a>, a game which was overdue decent home computer re-creations. You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.",
