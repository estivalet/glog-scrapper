  "description": "<i>Millennium: Return to Earth</i> is the forerunner to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/deuteros-the-next-millennium\">Deuteros: The Next Millennium</a> and has a premise similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Sierra\">Sierra's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Outpost\">Outpost</a>. Set in the 22nd century, the Earth has been destroyed, and the player's mission is to re-establish human colonization of other worlds, beginning with just one outpost and a few hundred survivors on the moon. Success requires maintaining life support, mining and producing resources for more colonies, and defense against a powerful alien race bent on humanity's destruction.",
