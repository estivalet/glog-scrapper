  "description": "<i>Space Invaders</i> is an implementation of the classic arcade game. The game has two playing modes: Modern and Classic. Modern features better graphics and some extra features.<br><br>Move your base at the bottom of the screen and kill as many aliens as possible. Aliens will move across the screen in a formation of 10 x 5 and for each switch of direction the will close in a bit on the player. The more aliens the player kills the faster the remaining aliens will move. Now and then a mothership will appear at the top och the game area. Destroying it will give the player some extra points, in modern mode destroying a mother ship will on later levels reward the player with better defences and fast shooting missiles.<br><br>The game was written in assembler.",
