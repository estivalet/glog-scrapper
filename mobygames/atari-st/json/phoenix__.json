  "description": "In <i>Phoenix</i> the player has to re-open 15 hyperspace routes which where previously closed by the authorities. Unfortunately they used mines to prevent illegal movements...<br><br>The game is played in a first-person perspective with vector graphics. The space ship moves with a constant velocity and the player's job is shoot the mines on the way and to steer left and right so he avoids obstacles. But it is important to be careful: leaving the road causes the space ship to fall out of the hyperspace and lose a life. The game records the last flight which can be used for analyzing and memorizing purposes.",
