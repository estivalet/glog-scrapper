  "description": "Early (1983) TRS-80 BASIC text adventure game, the middle in a forgotten trilogy (sandwiched between &quot;<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/project-triad\">Project Triad</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Codename+Intrepid\">Codename Intrepid</a>&quot;), remembered for its no-holds-barred approach to math and logic concepts informing game settings and puzzles: in one section, sparking a genre cliche, one has to play a text adventure game <i>inside the text adventure game</i>; in another, one falls asleep and in a dream constructs a proof utilising physical representations of various components of symbolic logic; additional game areas are accessed by pushing and popping the stack, objects extruded from 2 to 3 dimensions by <i>_y_</i>ing them.<br><br>The supporting documentation understates when it claims <i>the scenario for the adventure is meant to be vague</i> -- searching for a 12-word code phrase (unlocked in chunks upon completion of certain puzzles) is just an excuse for sending an unwary player through an alien and abstract setting two words at a time (using VERB NOUN gameplay with a vocabulary of about 200).<br><br>Later (1988) versions of this game were ported in C to Solaris, Atari ST and MS-DOS environments; more recently, in December 2003, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Andrew+Plotkin\">Andrew Plotkin</a> ported it to the interactive fiction standard of machine-independent Z-code.",
