  "description": "Racer 2 is the successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Atari+ST\">Racer</a> released in 2013. Unsurprisingly, it is a car racing game. <br><br>There are three playing modes: Championship, Challenge and Arcade. While in the Arcade mode the player is just driving for fun, in the Challenge mode the player competes with 7 AI controlled drivers for the win. Finally the Championship is a ongoing competition over all tracks with the ultimate goal to win the competition.<br><br>Overall there are 24 tracks, with up- and downhill passages, with the later tracks have to be unlocked first on racing success in the competitions. The 39 different cars in the game are displayed as scaled sprites. Each track is featuring it's own music, while sampled sound effects are mixed in.<br><br>Three difficulty levels are supported. The modes differ in the amount of time available to finish and the speed of the AI cars. Gear change can be optionally set to manual control, the default is automatically gear switching.<br><br>There are random bonus items appearing on the road, which offer higher maximum speed, kick opponents from the street, flatten the tires of opponents, freeze the time, and even kicking other cars from the road on ramming them. For a more serious challenge, this bonus system can completely deactivated in the options.<br><br>Exclusively running on the Atari Falcon computer, the game runs in high color mode (65.000 colors). The roads are texture mapped, but this can be turned off in the options for faster gameplay.",
