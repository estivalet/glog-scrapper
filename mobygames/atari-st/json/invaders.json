A large group of aliens ordered in 5 rows with 9 columns moves back and forth on the screen and every time they change direction they descend a bit. The more of them you kill the faster the remaining ones will move. Kill every alien in the wave to continue to the next level. Now and then a flying saucer will travel across the screen; killing it will yield additional bonus points.",
