  "description": "<em>Clogged up</em> is a moving puzzle game. On a 6x6 board your goal is to reach the exit with your clog shoe. It can only left and right and the way is blocked by many different stones in different lengths (2-4). All those stones can only be moved in the direction of their orientation, so some can moved up and down, others left and right (in later levels there are blocks movable in all directions). You have to move the stones until the way is free for your clog to move to the exit.<br><br>There are six worlds with several levels to unlock, starting with a Dutch theme and an Atari theme in world two. Each level solved is saved so you do not have to play it again. There are no points, but &quot;loscores&quot;, which are the amount of moves required until the level is finished. Also, if you only use the minimum account of moves possible, the score is marked as &quot;perfect&quot;. For each level solved you get additional help calls, which can be used if you are stuck. In a two-player multi-player mode two identical boards are displayed beside each other and the players simultaneously try to make the position as difficult as possible. After a given time the boards are swapped and each player has to solve the position the other player set up. The faster player wins the round.<br><br>There are high-score tables (or &quot;loscore&quot; table in this game), which are saved to disk.",
