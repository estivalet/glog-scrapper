  "description": "<i>Ball Park</i> is a labyrinth game in which you guide a red ball through 30 levels. Every level is filled with things like bonuses, one-way paths, keys, enemies, teleports and black holes. Once you move the ball it wont stop until it reaches a square with green arrows. Trying to move through a one-way path the wrong way will make the ball bounce. Hitting a key\nwill change the direction of a one-way arrow. Every level has a time limit so you can't think for too long before you move. You start with 3 lives and now and then you gain an extra life. The game is written in STOS.\n",
