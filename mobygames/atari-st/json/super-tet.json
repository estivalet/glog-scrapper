  "description": "<em>Super Tet</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> conversion. It features both single and two-player game mode.<br><br>In single player mode, levels are not increased during play, but are clearly separated: on finishing a level by reaching a certain amount of points, the board is cleared completely and the game increases speed of the stones. Also, from level 3, there are random stones placed somewhere on the board. Two player games can be played in the &quot;Normal&quot; mode, which plays like the single player game, but with the screen divided in two play-fields. The second two player mode, &quot;Tetra Kill&quot; is nasty: if a player forces his stone to fall faster (by pressing the joystick button), this is also happening for the stone on the other players field.<br><br>A high-score table is present and can be saved.",
