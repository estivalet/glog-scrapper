  "description": "This action game is similar to Konami’s arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rushn-attack\">Green Beret</a>. It scrolls from left to right, and the levels include ladders and platforms. A constant stream of enemies face you, and can be dispatched with either your machine gun, or one of your limited (but replenishable) supply of grenades. <br><br>The Codemasters logo appears liberally in the game, representing a variety of bonus items. These include jeeps and tanks which give you much more protection, and smart bombs and rapid fire.\n",
