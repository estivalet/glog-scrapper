  "description": "<i>The Jungle Book</i> is an action game where the visuals resemble the 1967 Disney movie adaptation of the same name, in turn based on the book by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,566173/\">Rudyard Kipling</a>.<br><br>The player controls Mowgli in different fixed-screen scenes linked together. He needs to pick up objects and use them to attack animals. The game is presented as the screen of a movie theatre. Near the bottom of the screen the back of a row of spectators is visible. Based on the player's actions they will either be attentive or fall asleep, shown through their posture and z's appearing above their heads.",
