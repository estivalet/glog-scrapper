  "description": "This game is actually a compilation of smaller games belonging to different genres. Krusty the clown appears in the beginning of the game and presents a menu with five games to play (one of which is not available from the start): A jump-and-run game, where Bart must find an exit on a ship, while enemies fire at him and try to prevent him from reaching the exit; a card game, where you have five tries to find hidden cards on a board; a simple jigsaw puzzle; a series of trivia questions concerning the Simpsons; and finally, a platform-skateboard game (available only after you have completed the ship level). Needless to say all games are connected to the famous TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.",
