  "description": "In the first-person interactive text adventure <i>Wizards Tower</i>, the player plays a young magic user that seeks out the wizard Marek, in hope that he will teach the player more about magic. But as it turns out, the wizard has disappeared and his tower has become home to many evil creatures. <br><br>The local population tells the player that many have entered the tower in search of riches but few have returned. The player now stands in front of the tower with one thought in mind: to retrieve the great wizards spell books. <br><br>In the beginning, the only thing the player is carrying is a spell book and a dagger. How much the player can pick up is limited by the player's strength and the objects weight. When the player adventures in this game it is important to keep an eye on hit points and power. Once the hit points reaches zero it's game over, and if his power reaches zero, no spells can be cast.",
