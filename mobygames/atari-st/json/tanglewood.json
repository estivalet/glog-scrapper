  "description": "<i>Tanglewood</i> is set on the planet T'ng-y-wd where Uncle Arthur has set up his mining operations. But just as he gets successful, a company tries to sue him out - the court date is in ten days and he has to prove his ownership of the planet. Now the player has to go there to find the needed documents.<br><br>The goal of the game is to use five mobiles to find items and use them in the right spot. This is made more difficult by the time limit (indicated with the day-night rhythm) and the big free-roaming world. Every mobile has different abilities, e.g. repairing, and attributes which allow them to travel through places the others can't pass. The action comes into play because the player directly controls the mobiles and has to evade the defenses built up by the company. Initially only one mobile can protect itself; the other ones have to find certain crystals and learn how to use them.<br><br>The player can instantly switch between the mobiles. This is not only needed to solve puzzles, but also because all mobiles (including the opponent's) run out of energy when used. The only way to recharge is to spend time with another mobile - but the time does not stop for the unused mobiles, so it is advised to park them at a save location. Some parts of the game take place underground, e.g. in mines.",
