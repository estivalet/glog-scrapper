  "description": "<em>Filler</em> is a conversion of the browser game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gimme-friction-baby\">Gimme Friction Baby</a> to the Atari ST. On the ground there is a cannon with constantly rotating angle. On firing the cannon, a ball enters the field and bounces off any wall or circle in the level area. If the ball comes to rest, it gets a random size and number between 1 and 3 printed in it. Hitting a circle decreases it's number and removes it from the field if the number reaches zero. If the ball shot crosses the line above the cannon, the game end (which happens after is bounces off from circles in the level). With each shot and bounce you earn points.<br><br>The game runs in any resolution and there is a binary for Coldfire-based Atari machines added. The game is written in C and the source code is included.",
