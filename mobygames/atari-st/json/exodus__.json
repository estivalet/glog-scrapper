  "description": "<i>Exodus</i> is a shoot-em-up game where the player flies a spaceship over alien space fortresses. <br><br>The background story is that the evil Marque-Wans have enslaved the people of Earth within nearly impenetrable space fortresses that are located in the vicinity of the Marque-Wans home world. The player is the only free hyper-fighter pilot so it is up to the player to free the humans.<br><br>The aim of each level is do destroy all of the ground defenses. To stop the player from doing this they will fire back and wave after wave of flying enemies will also try to shoot down the player. On later levels homing missiles will also be used against the player. <br><br>The player starts out with five lives and when all is lost it's game over. Fuel is limited and when the tank is empty the player will crash and lose one life. The alien fortresses are built like toruses so the player will just go round and round and never reach an edge in any direction. A map on the right side of the screen helps the player to find the ground defenses.",
