  "description": "You are woken by the cold. The last thing you remember was the ground coming up to meet you. Wreckage of your plane lies strewn around the antarctic landscape. Things look desperate for you, but if you are lucky you can find shelter, perhaps in one of the cabins left behind by the Shackleton expedition.<br><br><i>Erebus</i>, named after the second largest volcano of the Southern-most continent, is a point-and-click adventure game. It starts in the wilderness of Antarctica and moves to the bustling metropolis of Paris and the scorching deserts of Egypt, and even the inside of a UFO. <br><br>The game is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dragon%27s+Lair\"> Dragon's Lair </a> in that you have to make rapid decisions, with wandering into a wrong location, or a slow choice potentially leading to instant death. You also have to worry about your body temperature. Some locations are too cold for comfort and others too hot. Wearing or not wearing items of clothes will affect how quickly your body temperature changes. If your temperature gets outside of a certain range, you will also die.<br><br>The aim is to successively learn the positions of all of the dead ends, and progress further and further through the game. Most of the time is spent navigating through mazes of obstacles to the next part of the adventure. There are several locations containing objects which may be picked up for later use.",
