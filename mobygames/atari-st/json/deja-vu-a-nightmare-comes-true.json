  "description": "<i>Déjà Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!!</i> is the first game made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=ICOM\">ICOM</a>, known for its adventure games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Shadowgate\">Shadowgate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/uninvited\">Uninvited</a>. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. <br><br>In <i>Deja Vu</i>, action takes place in Chicago in December 1941. Your character's name is Theodore &quot;Ace&quot; Harding - a retired boxer working as a private eye. He wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who he is or what he is doing there. To make matters worse, you as him soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegetable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.",
