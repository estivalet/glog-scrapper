  "description": "<i>H Mec 2</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=H+Mec\">H Mec</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> clone. After the first game our hero retired to France and thought that the adventures were over. But now the ghosts are back and they want to electrocute H Mec.<br><br>The aim of the game is to collect as many pills as possible and complete as many mazes as possible. Beware of the ghosts and traps. To earn lots of points you have to be fast, if you don't collect a pill within 5 seconds from the last one points will start getting deducted from your total score and if you are really slow you will lose a life. Walls can hide bonuses, such as extra time, level warp or an extra life.",
