  "description": "Astro Panic is a shoot'em up similar to Space Invaders except there are less enemies and they move around the screen individually.<br><br>On each level there are 6 space ships and the player must shoot them all. The enemy ships move around in straight lines and bounce on the edges of the screen, similar to the balls in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a>. The ships do not shoot back at the player, but when an enemy ship collides with the player's cannon at the bottom of the screen one life is lost. When all cannons are lost the game is over. After each level the same enemy 6 ships re-appear and the player has to shoot them all again, but each time the speed of the enemy ships increases.",
