  "description": "<i>Megamix 2 - Brainstorm</i> is a memory game where two players have to compete to match most tiles. The game area consist of 6x5 tiles. A timer to the right of the play area shows the players how much time there is left of the game. This game is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/megamix\">Megamix</a>. The scoring is a bit more complex than in the previous game: the score depends on the tiles that are matched. Tiles have roman numerals on them and the player receives the sum of the as points: matching 'IV' will give the player 8 points. There are also Three special pairs: &quot;*&quot; which will double the score for the player, &quot;:&quot; which will divide the other players score by 2 and &quot;SWAP&quot; which will swap the scores of both players.",
