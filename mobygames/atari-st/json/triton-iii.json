  "description": "The player and his small ship has to enter a huge alien spacecraft. No further details about the scenery or background story are given in the game or accompanied materials. Triton III is a shoot 'em up game released on a budget price, so maybe further details are not required.<br><br>The game scrolls vertically and on some parts parallax scrolling is used. The player's ship always omits two shots which are handed separately. There are obstacles on the ground which are killing the player's ship instantly on collision. Some of those can be shot, others must simply be avoided. The flying enemies, which drain energy on collision, are appearing in formations. Clearing a complete formation, and sometimes the bigger enemies also count as formation, an extra items appear. There are extras containing extra fuel, a shield, increased fire rate, a booster and a mine jammer.<br><br>The game features six levels, on death the player must restart on the level beginning.",
