  "description": "<i>Atomix</i> is a puzzle game. On each level, you are given a couple of atoms, and your task is to arrange them into a specific molecule.<br><br>You see all the atoms available for you to move in a top-down view. Down below on the left side is a small preview of what you must get. That picture represents a molecular structure that you must recreate by moving atoms horizontally and/or vertically. Once you move an atom, it won't stop unless it hits an obstacle, like a wall, or another atom, therefore you must use walls and other atoms creatively.<br><br>The game contains 30 levels, and you have a limited time for each level.",
