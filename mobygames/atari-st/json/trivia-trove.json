  "description": "<i>Triva Trove</i> is a quiz game that consists of four parts that has to be completed in order. The first level is a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe played on a 3x3 board where each square contains a category. Upon choosing a category a four alternative question is given and if the player picks the right answer he gets a cross on the board and gets to choose the next category. If he answers wrong the computer will instead put a nought in the square. The game is timed and the first two levels have to be completed in twenty seconds.<br><br>In the second level the board is made up of eight circles with four subjects flashing on and off in sequence. The player has to stop the flashing when the chosen subject is black and then answer a question. Each of the four subjects have to be selected in turn which gets increasingly more difficult. <br><br>The third level is completely different. Here the player has to click on one of several squares that constantly change colour. The colours correspond to the ones used in a row of numbers at the bottom of the screen. The aim is to choose a square that represents a high number as possible. <br><br>The fourth level is played on a grid where some squares conceal jumbled up letters of a capital city. At the start the answers will flash and the player has to remember where they are. The player then has to answer questions to be able to uncover the squares and after each question the opportunity to guess the capital is given. ",
