  "description": "In <i>Zombi</i> you control a team of four intrepid travelers, who have landed their helicopter on the roof of a shopping centre in the hope of finding fuel. The problem is that, with Hell full, Zombies are walking the earth, devouring humans as they please.<br><br><i>Zombi</i> is a point and click survival horror game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. <br><br>Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though.",
