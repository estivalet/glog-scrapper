  "description": "<em>Flood</em> is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of Quiffy, a strange amphibious creature, on his quest to stop the flooding of his underground world. The gameplay is familiar (it is a platformer afterall), but there are some novel ideas, such as Quiffy's ability to cling to walls and ceilings.<br><br>During his travel to the planet surface, Quiffy will meet three kinds of menace. The first is the monsters, of course, as in any platformer. The two others are a bit more original: as the game's title implies, water will progressively flood the levels, endagering Quiffy - which, by the way, isn't amphibious. There is also a ghost which happens to be the spirit of Quiffy's late aunt (!) and which will chase him by reproducing every move he made a dozen of seconds later.",
