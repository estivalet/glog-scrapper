  "description": "<i>Cave Runner II</i> is a platform game clearly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/lode-runner\">Lode Runner</a>.<br><br>In 130 levels, the player have to collect all bottles in a level before a specific time limit is reached. Lot's of enemies and traps make this a difficult task. Cannons are shooting at you, arrows are flying around, boulders dropping constantly and moving enemies have to be attracted to specific positions to pass. There are ladders and ropes to move around quickly, some bonus items giving temporary protection against certain threads (like boulders). Secret passages can be found and diamonds can be collected for additional points.<br><br>Each level is a single screen, there is no scrolling. As the game is only running in high resolution (and monochrome colour) and unsing small tiles for the elements, these  screens are packed with functional elements and therefore some strategic planning is required before starting to move.<br><br>The game comes with an editor allowing the player to change all the existing levels or creating new ones.\n",
