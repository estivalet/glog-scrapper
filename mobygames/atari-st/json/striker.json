  "description": "<i>Striker</i> is a football (soccer) game with a forced-perspective 3D view. The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. The standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a common strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.",
