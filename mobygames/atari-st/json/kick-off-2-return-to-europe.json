  "description": "Return to Europe is a data disk for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-2\">Kick Off 2</a> that allows the player to participate in three major European Competitions: the UEFA Cup, the Cup Winners Cup and the European Cup. This was topical in the UK, as English clubs had just been readmitted into Europe, having been banned for several years following the Heysel stadium disaster of 1985.<br><br>The competitions are at different skill levels. The European Cup is the toughest of the three competitions. Each competition contains 32 teams that can be edited. The player can also load teams from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Giants+of+Europe\">Giants of Europe</a> data disk as well as from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Player+Manager\">Player Manager</a>. Tactics can be loaded from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Winning+Tactics\">Winning Tactics</a> data disk. ",
