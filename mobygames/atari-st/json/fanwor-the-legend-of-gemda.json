  "description": "<em>Fanwor - The Legend of Gemda</em> is an action adventure game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/legend-of-zelda\">The Legend of Zelda</a>, but with slightly reduced complexity and the main focus on action and exploration.<br><br>Once there was peace in the land of Fanwor, as Princess Gemda ruled the land protected by the eight &quot;Gems of Power&quot;. Somehow, during her holidays, monsters stole those Gems and locked them in deep dungeons. Of course you, the player, has to recover all eight.<br><br>You do this by travelling through flip-screen landscapes filled with monsters. You can hit them with your sword, which kills most monsters instantly, but some of the stronger monsters take several hits before they vanish. The player starts with 20 health points and those can only be recovered by finding one of the eight gems or a (rare) fairy lake. Getting one of the gems does not only restores full health, but also increases the maximum health by 10.",
