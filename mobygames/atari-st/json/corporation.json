This game preceded <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Wolfenstein+3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a> by a number of years, and while the walls were not ray cast, but solid fill polygons, it was still one of the earliest simulations to tackle a human viewpoint with complete, 360 degree freedom of movement.",
