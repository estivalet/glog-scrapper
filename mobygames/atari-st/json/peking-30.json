  "description": "<i>Peking 3.0</i> is a thorough modernisation of <moby game=\"Peking 2.0\">version 2.0</a>, rewritten to take advantage of advances in hardware since 1993. It is now fully GEM compliant, and works on anything from a lowly Atari ST to a modern ST clone or in replacement operating systems.<br><br>The basic game is still the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Shanghai\">Shanghai</a>, where you eliminate pairs of tiles in a pyramid. While the old version had four different tilesets built in, version 3 keeps tiles as separate data files, which can be downloaded or created by the user. A set of traditional tiles in three different resolutions is part of the standard package, with more available at the game's homepage, including cards, flags, traffic signs, a Christmas theme as well as a high resolution mahjong tileset digitised from actual pieces.<br><br>Not only the tiles can be changed, but also the layout, which is stored as separate files. No longer is the game limited to the typical Shanghai pyramid. The backdrop colour can be altered, and there is a floating toolbar for retracting or suggesting moves. The two-player mode is still available, as are all the other features of version 2.0.",
