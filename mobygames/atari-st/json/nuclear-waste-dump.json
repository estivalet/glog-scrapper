  "description": "In <em>Nuclear Waste Dump</em> the player takes the role as garbage collector. As the title suggests, it's not about ordinary waste, but nuclear waste. The game is an extended remake of the type-in program <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Uncle+Henrys+Nuclear+Waste+Dump\">Uncle Henry's Nuclear Waste Dump</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,45045/\">James Hague</a> released in Antic magazine in 1986.<br><br>The game is a puzzle game in which the cans of waste are falling from the top of the screen to the bottom and stacking up if other barrels are already present in the same column. <em>Nuclear Waste Dump</em> is reversing the usual scheme of color-matching used in related puzzle games: the waste bins are marked with four different symbols and your goal is to <em>avoid</em> the placement of similar marked barrels next to each other. If two of them are placed next to each other, the waste explodes and the game is over. The same happens if a stacked column reaches the upper border. The waste bins can be moved left and right, and they automatically fall down after a certain amount of time. This time gets shorter with progress in the game.<br><br>There are some special stones appearing randomly: a bomb, destroying the stones around it, a freezing barrel will prevent surrounding bins from exploding even if they have the same symbol. Another special will destroy all stones in it's way falling down. A high-score list is kept in the game and saved on exit.",
