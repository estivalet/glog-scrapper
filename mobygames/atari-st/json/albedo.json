  "description": "Albedo is a planet, and on this planet a man called Dick is holding a tournament and for those who master all the levels, a secret will be shared.<br><br>The player's avatar has a nice spacesuit, as well as magnetic shoes. These are handy, as they allow the player to run not only on the floor, but also on the walls and the roof. An alternative to running is a jump, which let you drift (and turn) until you reach the other side of the screen. Your only gun is shooting some kind of laser, presented as a line, which is reflected from the walls.<br><br>There are four basic levels which has to be mastered, which means a given score has to be reached before the other levels open and finally Dick can be reached. The levels vary in the form of the walls, some are more circular, other more like a rectangle. The enemies are different in each level, and can attack with sheer size (Grok) or an amount of small enemies (Virus).<br><br>Four separate two-player levels can be chosen, which can be played as death-match. If no second player is around, the computer can control player two.",
