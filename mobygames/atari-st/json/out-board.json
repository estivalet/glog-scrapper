  "description": "You as speedboat racer enters the championship taking place along the waterways of six cities (Paris, Venice, Amsterdam, London, New York, and Sydney). Kissed by a lovely woman and wearing the helmet, you should win the race accelerating and avoiding other competitors to do not crash into them or the debris in the water. In each waterway you must complete six laps, and at each end of the course, there are buoys which you must approach slowly in order to turn around. The other competitors are ill-mannered, regularly get in your way and want to throw you off the speedboat, so you often has to teach them a lesson of courtesy.",
