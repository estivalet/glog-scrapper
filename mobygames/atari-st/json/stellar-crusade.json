  "description": "<em>Stellar Crusade</em> is a two player game of exploitation and conquest on an interstellar scale. Two rival factions, The League and The People's Holy Republic, compete over a span of decades for control of a small, but richly endowed, star cluster in a remote arm of the galaxy. <br><br>The league is always controlled by the human player while the PHR may be either human or computer controlled. Each game turn represents three months and is divided into three phases with the PHR going first in each of the first two phases. The economic phase is where you do all your economic planning, expansion of industrial facilities and production of ships and military units. In the movement phase you'll issue orders for any covert operations, move ships, passengers and cargo between systems. The resolution phase is simultaneous and executed entirely by the computer.<br><br>The game will automatically end after the number turns specified in the scenario you're playing or if certain scenario specific conditions are met.",
