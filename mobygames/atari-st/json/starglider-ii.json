  "description": "More space combat and strategy in this sequel, which challenges you to collect the elements to form a bomb to destroy a resistance force, before delivering them through heavy fighting. Each planet has its own characteristics, with differing inhabitants and features. <br><br>As well as flying through space, you must dart through tunnels under the planets, which restricted your movement range but are where most of the weapons are. As you go along you'll have to obtain objects from people, and trade them so as to be able to complete your main objectives.<br><br>The biggest advance from the original Starglider was seen as the polygon graphics, which are filled on 16-bit systems, and contain considerable detail.",
