  "description": "As the ruthless Slayer you have hordes of enemies to wipe out in this horizontally-scrolling shooter. The paths are narrow and treacherous in a similar way to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Scramble\">Scramble</a>, so shooting out the wall-mounted installations is important. There are plenty of bonus weapons and shields available however, and 5 lives in total. Each of the 3 levels ends with a boss to defeat.",
