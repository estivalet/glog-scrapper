  "description": "<i>Carrier Attack</i> is a BattleShip game for one player written in STOS. Both players have 10 ships: 2 carriers, 2 battleships and 6 destroyers. When starting a game you have to place all your ships on a board consisting of 20 x 7 squares; ships can be places horizontally or vertically but every ship needs to be surrounded by free squares. After placing the ships each player takes turn and tries to hit the other players ships. The first one to sink the opponents ships wins the game.<br><br>The game can be played at 10 different difficulty levels ranging from &quot;Seaman&quot; to &quot;Kamikaze attack&quot;. On the hardest level the computer does three attacks every turn while you only get to do one.",
