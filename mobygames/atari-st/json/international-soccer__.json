  "description": "<i>International Soccer</i> is a soccer game in which two teams play against each other. The match itself can be varied with many settings, e.g. difficulty level, weather, half-time length or time of day, but there are no additional playing modes like a league to be found. However, the basic tactical approach can be set before starting the match.<br><br>When not in ball possession, the active athlete can be switched by pressing a button and the opponent can be tackled. The strength of a kick depends on how long the fire button is pressed.",
