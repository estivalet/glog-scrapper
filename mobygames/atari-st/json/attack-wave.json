  "description": "Earth is under attack of aliens. Luckily a forgotten SDI satellite named &quot;Hercules&quot; is in the orbit and still functional. Badly, the automatic targeting system is broken, so manually control of the weapon is required -- and taken by the player. <br><br><em>Attack Wave</em> plays similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/missile-command_\">Missile Command</a>, without reaching it's tactical depth. Waves of alien spaceships approaching from the top of the screen. Left and right the satellites weapons are positioned. If any ship reaches the line below the weapon, it counts as hit. Too many hits will loose you the game. You also have to keep an eye on the energy level of the laser, as any shot requires some of it. Some aliens can even shot, draining further energy.<br><br>There are several options to adjust gameplay difficulty, like e.g. changing the speed of the alien vessels.",
