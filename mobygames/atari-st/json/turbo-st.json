  "description": "Turbo ST is a racing game, which does not rely on hundreds of racing tracks, but directly booting into a track editor. You can change the two predefined tracks or create new ones. These can be loaded and saved as normal files, so are exchangeable easily. The track elements contain 45- and 90-degree curves, vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines.<br><br>There are three themes to assign to the tracks, which alter the graphical representation in game: Rising Sun, High Noon and Alps. The graphic comes with occasionally zooming sprites beside the bitmap road, with the background picture scrolling left and right. There are no AI drivers, so playing the game alone you can only race against the high score.<br><br>Up to four players can race against the time in a hot-seat mode on the created or loaded tracks. You car have four gears, switching up and down easily with the joystick. The score is always starting at 9999 and counting downwards with time and you also receive a penalty on the score for crashes.",
