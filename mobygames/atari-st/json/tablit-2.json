  "description": "<i>Tablit 2</i> is a word puzzle game where the player/players has to form as long words as possible and every new word must start as the last word ended. For example if player one entered end player two may start the next word with &quot;end&quot;, &quot;nd&quot; or &quot;d&quot;. The more letters that are kept from the previous players word the more bonus points are awarded. After a player has entered a word it is checked against a wordlist (if the players has choose to use one) and if it isn't in the wordlist the player/players may choose if the word should be accepted or rejected. If no wordlist is used the player/players always has to make that choice. If no letters are placed on the board during a turn that player may then swap one or more letters. The game ends either when all the letters have been used up or when the time limit is reached. The game comes with a wordlist of 10000 words.<br><br>Game statistics may be exported from the game to a file or to a printer.",
