  "description": "<em>Formel 1 - Manager</em> is a sporting simulation in German language. The player takes the role of a team manager and has to set up a competing team with a limited budget. You can hire two drivers, buy tires and engines, and compete in races, which are shown as text results. Each type of car part is available in three different models, with different costs and performance. Between the races random events occur, which are sometimes positive, like you get a new sponsor which grants you money, or very negative, like you just bought the most expensive engine and it broke during the training. If you cannot afford participating in a race, because you do not have the required parts for two cars, your drivers are not starting and you do not get any positive effects. After the season you get an overall report and can decide to play again.<br><br>The game is written in GFA Basic and only runnable on monochrome monitors.",
