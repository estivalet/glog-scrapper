Nothing has changed substantially: the gameplay and the graphics are identical to Phantasie. The adventuring party travels from town to town using a overview map of the countryside. There are many dungeons to explore and many different monsters to battle.<br><br>Again the Dark Lord Nikademus is the players' evil opponent, having fashioned an evil orb and cast a curse on the beautiful island of Ferronrah, enslaving its people. The players' mission is to find and destroy the evil orb.",
