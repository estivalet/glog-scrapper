  "description": "One of the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/speedball\">Speedball</a> clones takes the basic court layout of basketball as its inspiration. There are 5 players on each team, on a small court with 2 and 3 point shooting areas. The difference is that physical contact of a fairly violent nature is allowed, and the court is littered with mines and bombs to wound the players. Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.",
