  "description": "<i>Fraction Goblins</i> is an educational text adventure for the Amiga and Atari ST. The objective of the game is to retrieve your art supplies - pencils, crayons and so on - that have been stolen by a group of mischievous goblins, and left scattered across the network of caves that the goblins live in. When you have found some of these items and you are carrying them back to the art room where they will be safe, a goblin may suddenly jump out at you and give you a fraction-based math problem. If you do not answer the question correctly, the goblin will steal something you are carrying and take it away to some other location.",
