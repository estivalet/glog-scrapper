  "description": "<i>Railway Motion</i> is a sliding puzzle in high resolution for one or two player. <br><br>The aim of the game is to make a clear path for a train through each level, you do this by moving around tiles so that you get a connected route from start to finish. You can only move tiles that have an empty square as a neighbour, tiles marked block can't be moved at all. The game comes with 13 levels, all in the size of 10 x 7 tiles. <br><br>You start the game with 250 points and a bonus of 250. The score and bonus will decrease over time and when a level is complete the bonus will be added to the score and the new values are transferred to the next level. When the bonus reaches 0 it will go back to 250 at the next level and start to decrease again.",
