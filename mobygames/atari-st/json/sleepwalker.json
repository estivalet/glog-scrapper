Ralph must bridge gaps, beat up baddies, stop Lee falling into water, inflate his own body and float above obstacles, and generally be a selfless version of man's best friend.<br><br>Between each of the major levels, there is a dream sequence where Ralph can collect various tokens and trigger what he &quot;really&quot; thinks should happen to Lee.<br><br>There are six huge parallax scrolling main levels and five bonus levels. There are several full motion video sequences setting the story.<br><br>There is also a special Amiga 1200 version which has enhanced full motion video and in game graphics.",
