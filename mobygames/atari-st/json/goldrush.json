Your first mission is to recover the PosiGold stolen from the Galactic Government on the planet Supre-60. The PosiGold is located on a spaceship where every deck is guarded by a single class II droid. You carry a 4D plastic carrier bag to carry the recovered PosiGold in plus thousands of bombs.<br><br>Bombs only works on the floor and not on ladders, glass or the guard. After a while the ships computer will restore the damaged floor without any regard for what's in its place. Once a level has been cleared of stolen PosiGold the level exit will be revealed. Droids can be heat seeking or motion seeking (players choice).",
