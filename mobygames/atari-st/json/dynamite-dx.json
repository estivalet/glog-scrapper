  "description": "Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/renegade\">Renegade</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Double+Dragon\">the Double Dragon series</a> are famous examples.<br><br>Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin (and his red buddy Pin), and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Achacha's clutches.",
