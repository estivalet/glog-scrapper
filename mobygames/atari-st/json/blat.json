  "description": "<i>Blat</i> is a one player freeware block game that resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Columns\">Columns</a>. As in Columns blocks in groups of three falls from the top of the screen and you have to arrange them into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 gives more points. Created sequences does not disappear all at once; if you manage to create more than one the game starts with eliminating the sequence that starts highest up to the left and moving from left to right. so if you have a horizontal sequence and a diagonal sequence booth starting at the same square you will only get points for the horizontal one and if you create a diagonal sequence and a vertical one you will only get points for the diagonal one. <br><br>To make the game more interesting there are plenty of special blocks such as dynamites, flames, clocks, hammers, and so on. Different levels have different sets of blocks, from the standard square ones to pieces that looks like they are from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pipe-dream\">Pipedream/Pipe Mania</a>. If the situation looks grim you could always use the smart bomb to ease things up.",
