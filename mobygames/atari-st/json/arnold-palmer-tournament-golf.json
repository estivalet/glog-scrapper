  "description": "Select your level of play, and then head for the pro shop to choose between Black Carbon, Glass Fiber, and Ceramic Clubs.<br><br>Tee off by yourself or play 18 holes with a friend. Besides the One and Two Player modes there's also a practice mode, match play (head to head), and a full-blown international tournament, where you'll stroke it out against 15 competitors.<br><br>Tournament play lasts 12 rounds, 18 holes of golf each. Most rounds are standard &quot;stroke&quot; play but the seventh and eighth rounds are &quot;match&quot; games. Things really get serious when match game ends in a tie, and players move into a sudden death play-off.<br><br>During the tournament players earn higher skill levels, more knowledgeable caddies, and more power. You'll earn a password at the end of each round of the tournament.<br><br>The game let's you play on three different courses; Japan, the United States, and Great Britain. ",
