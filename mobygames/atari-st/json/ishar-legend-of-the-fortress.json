  "description": "<i>Ishar: Legend of the Fortress</i> is the sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/crystals-of-arborea\">Crystals of Arborea</a>. Morgoth and Morgula, the black god and his witch wife who were defeated in the previous game, had a child, Krogh. Their evil progeny is based in the fortress Ishar, which means &quot;unknown&quot; in the elven tongue, and has plans to reduce to population of Kendoria to slavery.<br><br>The player takes the role of a traveler who, with the aid of up to five companions, battles through the fortress to defeat Krogh and stop the spread of the powers of chaos. Unlike its predecessor, <i>Ishar</i> is viewed entirely from first-person perspective, and its combat is real-time rather than turn-based.",
