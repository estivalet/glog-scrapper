  "description": "<i>Verthor</i> is a board game. Two players are competing on a board with numbers. Those numbers can either be positive (red color) or negative (blue color) or neutral (the zero). Each time a number is selected, it is added to the score, so with negative numbers, the score can also decrease.<br><br>The trick with the game is that one player can only move the cursor vertically (in the board column) and the other can only move it horizontally (in the board rows). If a stone is chosen and the according row/column is empty, a random new stone appears. This lead to games in which the score first raises for both players, as mostly positive numbers are picked and at the end of the level the score is decreasing, as mostly negative numbers are left on the board. A strict time limit on moves makes this a game for quick thinkers.<br><br>The game features five levels with different background pictures and some special stones like random numbers in later levels.",
