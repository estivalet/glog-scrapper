  "description": "<i>Elemental</i> is set on the planet of the same name. The player takes the role of a two-year old Roundline, basically a living ball, who has to pass the great ordeal. <br><br>Every of the 32 levels plays out on a non-scrolling field where the player has to evade two enemies and touch certain tiles. This causes objects to appear which can be picked up and dropped at another place. If an enemy touches an object, it transforms into a pill which also has to be picked up and dropped elsewhere. There are save tiles where the enemies can't touch the player.",
