You have to construct a bridge between your two sides (red player has to construct the bridge between the top and bottom of the screen and yellow player between the left and right side of the screen). Each player has 20 bridge pieces to play with. The game area has 60 squares in it; 30 red and 30 yellow. The players build their bridges between these squares. Once a bridge piece has been placed it can not be removed and the other player can not pass it.",
