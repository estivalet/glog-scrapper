  "description": "This top-down soccer game has a similar long-range look to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sensible+Soccer\">Sensible Soccer</a>. The ball runs close to the player, but some fine control is required. Passing involves pushing the controller in the pass direction while hitting fire. <br><br>The English Premiership teams of the time are included, with 22 man squads and 8 formation options. You can play individual matches or league or cup tournaments. Match lengths can be set between 2 and 20 minutes, with 3 levels of wind, 3 levels of referee toughness, and 5 pitch styles. Replays can be viewed in 3 speeds, and stored for later viewing.",
