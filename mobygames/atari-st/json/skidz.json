  "description": "In <i>Skidz</i>, the player moves through the five levels with the goal to collect and dispose of all litter lying around. To be more exact, 75% of the litter has to be collected and put into dust bags on the way to get access to the next level. However, not all litter is in easy to reach positions and has to be collected with tricky jumps. The controls work in a way that the player builds up the speed by pressing a button or pulling the joystick in a direction. If high speed is reached, another press of the button results in a jump. <br><br>The protagonist has a certain amount of health which decreases when he rams against the environment or citizens (some of them actively try to hurt the protagonist), drives over broken bottles or misses a jump. Power ups include health refreshments, bonus time for the time limit and coins which are used to buy useful equipment between levels. Bonus points can be earned by performing stunts while jumping, but failing results in a crash. The player chooses between a skateboard or a bike, but this makes no significant difference in gameplay.<br><br>Additionally to the regular playing mode, there is also a race to participate in. It involves one opponent and various obstacles which need to be jumped over",
