Your subconscious has created a moon infested with evil beings, and a Pegasus ground-skimmer with which to destroy them.<br><br>The chances are that you played <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tau+Ceti\">Tau Ceti</a> shortly before bedtime, as <i>Phantasm</i> has much in common with that game's action elements. Armed with lasers and homing missiles, you must take down the aliens before the shoot you.",
