  "description": "<i>Space Racer</i> is an action racing game with a sci-fi theme. The player controls a futuristic hoverbike, competing against computer-controlled vehicles of a similar kind. The races take place in outer space-themed environments, resembling surfaces of alien planets. The player should try to avoid collision with the other bikes to get to the finish line first; a more violent way of solving the same problem involves shooting at the opponents. The altitude of the hoverbike depends on its speed - the faster it goes, the farther away from the ground it is, and vice versa.",
