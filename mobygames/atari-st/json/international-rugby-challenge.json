  "description": "The follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rugby-the-world-cup\">Rugby: The World Cup</a>. The game features more options than before, with an icon-driven menu system including different control choices and match lengths.<br><br>Controls are similar to the original game, but tackling is now harder and requires more precise player placement, and rucks and mauls are implemented. As before, the scrums involve joystick-waggling, and are crucial to advancing the ball. Conversions are taken from a separate 3D view.",
