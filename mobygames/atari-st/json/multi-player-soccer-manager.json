  "description": "<i>Multi-Player Soccer Manager</i> is a football/soccer management game that allows up to four players to play at the same time.  The game has four divisions from Division 1 to Division 4 with 16 teams in each division.  Each team is assembled with a squad of up to 16 players.  You begin as manager of a Division 4 team which is randomly selected for you when you start the game. <br><br>Each season has a 30-game league schedule where you must finish in the top two to gain promotion to the next division. In higher leagues, the bottom two teams are relegated to the lower division.  If you finish in the bottom of Division 4 you win the “league joker” trophy.  If your team performs well you may get offered a job at a higher level team during the season. Teams also compete in League Cup and F.A. Cup matches as well where teams of all divisions take part and can play against each other.<br><br>Other features in the game include buying and selling players in the transfer market, arranging training for your players and increasing your ground's capacity and safety. If you run out of money, you will be sacked and offered the job of the bottom team of Division 4. If you choose decline the job, the game will end.  The same occurs if you choose to resign at any time.",
