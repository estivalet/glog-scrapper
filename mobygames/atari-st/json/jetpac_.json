  "description": "First assemble your rocket by collecting the three rocket pieces with your jetpack, then fill it with fuel by collecting fuel drums with your jetpack and finally blast off with your rocket to the next level. After the first level the rocket is already in working condition so all the player has to do is to fill it up with fuel. While picking up pieces of the rocket and fuel drums the player has to defend him-/her-self against an onslaught of countless aliens coming from the left and right. Now and then bonus items will drop down from above and they will give the player extra ammo, extra point and such things. The game features 50 one-screen levels and was coded in 68000 assembler.",
