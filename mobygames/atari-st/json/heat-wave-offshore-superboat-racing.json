  "description": "<i>Heat Wave: Offshore Superboat Racing</i> is a racing game in which the player uses a power boat to race against four AI opponents. There are various aspects to keep track of during a race, like avoiding overheating the motors or a steady adjustment of the trim. During the race it may be needed to stop and conduct repairs on the ship due to contact with the opponents or the environment. However, it is important that the player took repair parts and fuel (which can be chosen after the qualifying race) with them. There are six courses and an editor to create more.",
