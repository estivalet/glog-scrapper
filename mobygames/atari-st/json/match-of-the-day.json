  "description": "There was a massive wave of football management games in 1992, and this was Zeppelin's contender. It was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.",
