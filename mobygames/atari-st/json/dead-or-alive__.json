  "description": "<i>Dead or Alive...?</i> is a text adventure created using STAC. It's a rainy day and you are on your way home. You decide to take a short cut and end up in a  dead end. You see a shop you've never seen before and enter it out of curiosity. The owner offers you a strange crystal that somehow renders you unconscious. The next thing you know  you wake up in the street outside the shop, but the shop is gone and so are your memory of where you live. You do remember where your local pub is and decide to pay it a visit only to discover that the place has been boarded up and is soon to be destroyed. That comes as a chock to you and renders you unconscious once again, this time the man from the shop appears and say the word &quot;midnight&quot; before he disappears in a puff of smoke. Your mission is now to find out what is going on and what have happened to you.<br><br>Although this game was created using STAC there is no graphics that illustrates the different locations you visit.",
