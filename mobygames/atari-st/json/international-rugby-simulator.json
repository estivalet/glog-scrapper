  "description": "Seven-a-side rugby union is brought to life in this budget game.  The action is viewed from the side, although kicks to the posts are played from a behind-the-posts perspective. Scrums and line-outs are incorporated for as realistic a game as possible given the player restriction. A tournament can be played with up to 8 players, with as many computer teams as required to fill the gaps.<br><br>In the ST version the tactical side of the game is very complex - seventeen different formations are on offer. Other gameplay variables can be set - player stamina (lower values forcing you to play a more conservative game), how long a player takes to recover from a tackle, and the standard strengths of passes and kicks, pus some very complicated mathematical coefficients. The ability to rename teams, change kits and alter the match lengths seem banal by comparison.",
