Now a chance for freedom has arrived! The aim of the game is to escape hell. You have to move from room to room until you reach the exit. In every room there is four candles of different colors which you have to collect in a certain order. When you have collected all four candles you are allowed to pick up the key which allows you to progress to the next room. The order in which the candles has to be collected varies between rooms.
