  "description": "<i>Elite TNK</i> is a rewrite in C of the original assembler source code for the original BBC <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Elite\">Elite</a>. As such, it has the same basic gameplay, input method and look, but is portable both to systems which have never had an Elite version of their own and those which can't run their Elite version on modern hardware.<br><br>As in the original, you start out with a plain Cobra spaceship and 100 credits and it is up to you what to do; shop around, engage in piracy or fulfill missions. Or you could just enjoy the view.<br><br>The graphics run in a higher resolution than the original BBC version, and the wireframe graphics can be swapped for filled polygons and even more advanced 3D effects depending on platform and version. Input devices not thought of when Elite was first written, such as mice, can also be used.<br><br>In 2002, distribution of all versions of Elite TNK was shut down, along with further development, at the request of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1003/\">David Braben</a>.",
