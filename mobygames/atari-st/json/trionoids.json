  "description": "<i>Trionoids</i> is a falling blocks puzzle game that is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Columns\">Columns</a>. Groups of three vertically aligned blocks fall from the top of the screen and the player has to guide them to the bottom. The aim is to match three or more blocks of the same colour which can be done vertically, horizontally and diagonally. As matches are made the blocks disappear and others fall down which can lead to chain reactions. While the blocks are falling the player can move them left and right, switch their order and speed up their descent. The goal of the game is simply to get the best score but as time progresses the speed increases. The game ends when blocks reach the top of the screen.",
