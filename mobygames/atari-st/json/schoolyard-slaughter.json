  "description": "Schoolyard Slaughter is a simple game (albeit an offensive one) wherein players earn points for shooting school children in the head for sport.<br><br>The gameplay echoes that of the standard point-and-click shooters that were commonly being produced at the time, and features crudely drawn children darting across a fixed backdrop at varying speeds. One hundred points are awarded for each successful headshot, along with a brief animation of the unfortunate victim collapsing in a pool of his or her blood.\nThe player receives extra ammo for every thousand points, and the game ends when the player runs out of bullets. After the game, players can qualify to enter their name into the &quot;Sportsman Journal&quot; (a high score list) if their body count is impressive enough.",
