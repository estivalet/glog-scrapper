  "description": "A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must defuse it. \nReaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally defuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases, furniture can be used to your advantage. \nThe whole game is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Impossible+Mission\">Impossible Mission</a>, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.\n",
