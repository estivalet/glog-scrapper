  "description": "The trolls are posing a threat to humanity, and it's your job to sort them out in this traditional-style platform game, which features over 200 screens. You have a gun and bolts of energy available to protect you. The graphics have detailed sprites but very plain backdrops, in an attempt to create a mood. Unusually a construction kit is included, allowing you to design your own levels down to the last detail. Another novelty is the option of mouse control on 16-bit systems, a seemingly impractical option for a platform game.",
