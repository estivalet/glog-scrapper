  "description": "This is a driving simulation is which you get to drive all the stages in the Lombard RAC rally. The game includes day and night stages, along with different weather conditions such as fog and snow. There is also a workshop option where you can repair and tweak your car to get a bit of extra speed. The game's main innovation is that the screen display is from behind the front seats - you can see the driver adjusting the steering wheel and gearstick, and the co-driver holds a map which changes colour as the track is covered.",
