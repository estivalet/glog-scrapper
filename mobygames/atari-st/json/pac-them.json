  "description": "<em>Pac Them</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/pac-man\">clone</a> running on the Atari Falcon.<br><br>It does feature four ghosts with slightly different behaviour, power-pills to take revenge and eat the ghosts for a short time, and a lot of pills to eat to clear the level. There are 20 different level maps which are not taken from the original, but created for this game. An addition to the classic game is the adding of teleporter fields: touching one of this elements, you are instantly ported to the other teleporter, which can be handy to trick the ghosts. Fruits, which are rewarding some extra points are randomly spawning at certain positions in the level. They award 1000 points, which is equal to the amount of points capturing all four ghosts with a power-pill. A high-score table is available and saved to disk. During the game, no music is played, but there are sampled effects.",
