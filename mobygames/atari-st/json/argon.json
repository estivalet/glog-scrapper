  "description": "<em>Argon</em> is a room-based shooter which plays like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cybernoid-the-fighting-machine\">Cybernoid</a>. A spaceship has to be manoeuvred through a maze of single screens, which are flipped on reaching any border with a connection to another room. The ship can only shoot horizontally, but can turn inside the level so shot left and right. Moving enemies can be shot and transform into coins to collect. Rooms are guarded by either moving enemies on fixed flying paths and turrets, which fire in random patterns. Contact with any wall or obstacle in a level is, like being hit by any shot, an instant death. Occasionally there are shops in the levels which offer e.g. a bigger shot, missiles or a shield in exchange for the collected money.<br><br>The ultimate goal of the game is to collect six green magic balls and find the exit of the maze, which is guarded by an end-of-level boss. There is no high-score table, but exploration progress is shown on Game Over.",
