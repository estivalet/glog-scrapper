  "description": "Taking off from where <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=MiG-29+Fulcrum\">MiG-29 Fulcrum</a> left off, Simis created a new simulator based around the top-modern MiG-29M. The M model has been equipped with modernised avionics, a fly-by-wire system and stronger engines.<br><br>As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.",
