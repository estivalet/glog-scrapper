  "description": "<i>Overlord</i> is a board game created using Talespin.<br><br>The overlord is an evil being who has been challenged by the timelords. They try to construct magical pyramids that will focus their energies so that they can beat the overlord. You are one of the timelords and you must construct the three levels that a pyramid contains. You must then also be powerful enough to warp to the top of the pyramid so that you may become the new overlord. <br><br>The board is divided into 8 squares (planes) and in the middle there is a void where the pyramid will be constructed. You start the game on square 4 with 0 energy, if you don't move to the next square on your turn you will gain one energy unit. Movement around the board is clock-wise and if you complete a lap you will gain maximum power which is 5. As your pyramid grows you will attract attention from the overlord and he might send his evil insectoids after you. An insectoid will survive for one lap an if it during that lap ends up on the same square as you you die and it's game over.<br><br>Up to four players (one for each element) compete to become the new overlord.",
