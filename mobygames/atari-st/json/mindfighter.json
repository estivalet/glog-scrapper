  "description": "The computer game of an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,237647/\">Anna Popkess</a> book (which was originally bundled with the game) uses an interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN for short. It’s set in a post-apocalyptic world of guards desperately attempting to retain order over mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive use of the death penalty. <br><br>Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state.<br><br>Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.\n",
