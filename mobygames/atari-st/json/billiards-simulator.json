  "description": "<i>Billiards Simulator</i> is a carom billiards game which is played with three balls and on a table without pockets. In the first phase of the shot, the cue is aligned to the ball. Here the player can either use the full 3D perspective or a top-down view. After that, the used cue (there are three), the spin and the strength of the shot is chosen by aligning diagrams and sliders. Then the shot is performed and points assigned. Additionally the player can set certain parameters to change the game experience, e.g. ball weight, friction or rebound.",
