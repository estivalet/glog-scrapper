  "name": "The Ultimate Arena",
  "shortName": "ultimate-arena",
  "description": "The story of the game is inspired by popular games of the same time, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/speedball\">Speedball</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/smash-tv\">Smash T.V.</a>: In the not-too-distant future, the most popular television show lets contestants battle it out in an all-out fighting match called the Ultimate Arena.<br><br>What this turns out to be is a man-versus-man fighting game with digitised graphics, which was à la mode in American coin-ops at the time, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pit-fighter\">Pit-Fighter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>, complete with sprays of blood for every hit. On the Atari, the sprites aren't quite as large as in arcade games, though.<br><br>At the start of a one-player game, two characters are available to play with: Terry from France and Sandy from London. All seven characters are available to choose from in two-player mode.<br><br>Each player has the usual assortment of 18 jumps, kicks and punches, most of which are easily executed with a normal Atari joystick, as well as a few special moves. Some carry weapons, while some can fire energy bolts. Instead of the common best-out-of-three system, sudden death is enforced, so a opponent must be beaten on the first attempt. If you do so, another stands in line. Being pushed into a corner is also more dangerous than other similar games, since the ringside is electrified. Stay close to the centre of the arena, or you will be burnt to a crisp.<br><br>Released at the far end of the Atari's commercial life, Ultimate Arena is notable for being one of few STE-only games, which makes the digitised sounds and graphics more natural than had it been a normal ST game.",
