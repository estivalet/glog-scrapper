Various enemies hinder progress and can be killed using an upgradable weapons system based on bouncing balls and a flamethrower. Extras and 'diamonds' can be collected from shooting or otherwise destroying rocks and walls. There are two playing modes available, one player or two players.<br><br>Extra lives will be earned depending on the number of diamonds collected. Warp Zones and hidden entrances allow access to secret zones in the levels. Each world ends with a boss monster. ",
