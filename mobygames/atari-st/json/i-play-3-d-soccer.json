  "description": "<i>I Play 3D Soccer</i> is one of the earliest 3D football games. You take control of a single player, viewing the action from right behind his perspective. Signalling for your team-mates to pass you the ball is a key gameplay element - don't expect to just watch your team win with no contribution from you. When you gain possession (or press the button while not in possession) your player automatically turns to face the goal.<br><br>Only single matches are on offer. There are ten skill levels; match lengths and team kits can also be modified. Two-player matches are split-screen. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=5+018247+512465\">Sensible Soccer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kick-off-2\">Kick Off 2</a>, the offside rule is featured.",
