The board computer tells the protagonist that is was build for one reason alone: blowing up the dictator's base.<br><br><i>MacWars</i> is a an action game with vector graphics and many similarities to the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars\">Star Wars</a> arcade game. The focus lies on flying through linear levels and shooting the dicator's minions with the standard laser and various rockets. The game is divided into various levels with different objectives, e.g. fueling the space ship, getting to the base, destroying radar towers around the base and flying into the base reactor room to blow it up (and flee in time). An options menu gives various opportunities to change the game rules and difficulty.",
