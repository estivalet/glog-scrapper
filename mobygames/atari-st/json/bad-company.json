  "description": "The plot of &quot;Bad Company&quot; is quickly told: Earth is dying and mankind needs new worlds to colonize, the Nu-Worlds. You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.<br>\n<br>\n&quot;Bad Company&quot; is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-harrier\">Space Harrier games</a>.<br>\nBefore you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including &quot;level bosses&quot;.You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.<br>\n<br>\nThe game extends over four levels (the four Nu-Worlds).",
