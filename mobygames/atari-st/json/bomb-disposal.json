  "description": "<i>Bomb Disposal</i> is a puzzle game written in GFA Basic 3. The aim of the game is to disarm a bomb. You have 20 diodes which you must place in their sockets in correct order. Every diode has a number that you must match to a hidden number by placing it in the correct socket, two indicators (seq and pos) lets you know if you got the sequence and position right. Once a diode has been placed it can not be removed so a misplaced diode means that the player has to start all over again.",
