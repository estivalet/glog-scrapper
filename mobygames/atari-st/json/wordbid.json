  "description": "<i>Wordbid</i> is a one player word guessing game. At the beginning of each round you get to know how many letters the current word has and how many vowels there are in the word. You start the game with $200 in cash and for every wrong guess you lose $20 and for every right guess you earn $10. If you think you can guess the whole word press enter and type it. If you guessed right next round starts. The game is over when you run out of cash.",
