  "description": "<i>Bombs Away</i> is a freeware <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bomberman\">Bomberman</a> clone written in GFA Basic 3.5 with the Sprite Works Development Kit.<br><br>The aim of the game is to find the exit which is hidden behind one of the brick walls. Brick walls can be destroyed by placing a bomb right next to them. There is something hidden behind each wall, but not everything is worth collecting. Things you may find includes extra bombs, power increase, score bonuses and a mystery pick up. The game consists of ten levels and every level must be completed under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. <br><br>At the first level there is one enemy and as you progress the number of enemies increases, they don't lay bombs but they kill on contact. The more walls you destroy and enemies you kill the more points you get, if you leave a level without killing all enemies or destroying all the walls a large number of points will be deducted from your score. Last but not least: you only have one life.",
