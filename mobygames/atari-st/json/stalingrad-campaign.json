  "description": "<i>The Stalingrad Campaign</i> is a 1 - 2 player war game based upon the Nazi invasion of the USSR during World War II.<br><br>Designed for 1 - 2 players, each player controls the major land forces of either Nazi or Soviet forces. A computer opponent is available for 1-player games. The viewpoint is of the general staff, and every turn the player is given objectives from either Moscow or Berlin to take control of a specific location on the map, while also being given forbidden locations.  The player is ultimately judged by how well they meet the demands of headquarters, and how each country fares against historical standards. The game is text-only, and came with a board and physical pieces to allow the player to keep track of the location of theirs and enemy units.<br><br>Each turn encompasses 1 week, and there are four separate scenario choices.  During each turn, the player can review reports from the front lines, as well as reports from individual units and headquarters.  During this phase, the player can also issue orders for their troops, including setting movement objectives and posture for their units.  They can also assign supply priorities, location of air corps, and can move their different headquarters to enable better communication.<br><br>After setting orders, the computer distributes supplies and automatically calculates movement and combat results of the individual units, and the player receives results of battle action.  Fog of war is a constant through battle, and the player can lose track of their own or enemy units if their communication is cut off, and the player never receives entirely accurate reports of enemy location and movements.  \n",
