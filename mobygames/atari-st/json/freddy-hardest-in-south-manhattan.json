  "description": "In the future NYC has become inhospitable and depraved, with thugs lining every street waiting to pounce on ordinary civilians. Thankfully Freddy Hardest is on hand to face up to the baseball bats and knives, in a side-scrolling beat 'em up game.<br><br>As with any <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Dinamic%27\">Dinamic</a> title, the difficulty level is set high. A few kicks and punches are available to you, and you have one life with energy which depletes as you get hit, but can be recharged by finding a safe space to stand still.",
