  "description": "<i>Minos</i> is a first person labyrinth game with 40 levels. The aim of each level is to first find a key and then the exit door. At the start of the game you can choose which level you want to play. At the start of every level you have one torch. You have to find the exit before the torch goes out or else it's game over. On later levels you can find extra torches lying on the floor in the labyrinth and you can carry up to three extra torches, four if you don't have the key.",
