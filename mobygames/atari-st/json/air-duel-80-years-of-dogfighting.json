  "shortName": "air-duel-80-years-of-dogfighting",
  "description": "As the name suggests, this flight simulation gives you a chance to fly most of the famous fighter models from World War 1 to the present day. You can fly the Sopwith Camel, the Spitfire, the F-4 Phantom, the Harrier Jump Jet, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Fokker DR1, and the MiG-23, each with realistic and functional cockpit features.  The game offers 6 historical missions, a duel mode and a &quot;What If?&quot; air duel. In the latter, you can apply weapons from different time periods to aircraft, and try to shoot down a modern plane using an older one.",
