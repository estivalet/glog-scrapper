  "description": "<i>Robert in the Fire Factory</i> is a remake of the Atari XL game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/mr-robot-and-his-robot-factory\">Mr. Robot and His Robot Factory</a>. The player has to walk over all platforms in a level to complete it. Flames, bombs and other obstacles are in the way. When collecting a blue-flashing power-up the player gets a temporary shield that enables him to destroy the enemies. Transporters and other fixed constructions, as well as taking falling damage when jumping to a platform from slightly too high, makes this a challenge.<br><br>An editor is included with the program (the build-in levels are not editable).",
