  "description": "<i>Wizard Warz</i> is an overhead view action game with very light role-playing elements. The player starts off as an apprentice wizard whose goal is to defeat seven master wizards and become the chief wizard himself. To accomplish that he must return six treasures to their rightful owners and find more powerful spells. <br><br>The wizard starts with four minor spells of the player's choice, and can acquire new ones during the course of the game. The gameplay focuses on exploring wilderness areas and fighting monsters. Enemies have their own strengths and weaknesses to the wizard's offensive magical barrage, so choosing the right spell against the right foe is usually the key to success. The wizard can also summon a familiar to help him on his mission. For example, having a crow will extend the player's viewing distance.",
