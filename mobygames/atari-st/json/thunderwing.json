  "description": "The player controls Thunderwing, an „Urban Air Fighter“, which is stolen to help the rebel forces against some suppressor.<br><br>The game is a vertical scrolling shooter. The ship is equipped with lasers and can activate the disruptor, a force field around the ship, destroying everything near. There are differently colored enemy formations, which give different rewards on complete destruction: a red formation rewards an update to the basic laser cannon, destroying two blue and two red formation is rewarded with an extra live. Some ground enemies leave a reload to the limited disruptor. There are end-of-level bosses to defeat.\n",
