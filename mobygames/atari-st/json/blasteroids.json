  "description": "As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a> gameplay. That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. <br><br>In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp’s control.\nEach level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.",
