  "description": "The Alpha 2 research colony on Xelos has been invaded by aliens, wiping out the crew and laying 167 of their eggs, all waiting to hatch into a lethal alien infestation. Superhero Kal Solar is the only one who can prevent a catastrophe, and that's where you come in.<br><br>The game is viewed in 3D from Solar's perspective, with a full HUD built into his helmet showing direction, health and supplies. Other HUDs also allow you to check whether the current air is breathable (you have limited oxygen), as well as one built into your Jetpack.<br><br>There are two movement modes, one of which allows you to pan the view and the other allows you to shoot. Objects have to be picked up and used, computers operated, and an infra-red kit located and used. To win the game you will have to destroy all the eggs, and then shut the compound down and escape in time.",
