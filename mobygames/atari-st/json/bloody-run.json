  "description": "Bloody Run is a competitive racing game heavily inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/trailblazer\">Trailblazer</a>.<br><br>Two players are controlling balls, which are automatically rolling over a lane consisting of blocks of different color. Depending of the color, there are different effects on the speed or control. While white and blue fields are nothing special, green ones are slowing your ball, yellow ones are accelerating it. A red field throws your ball in the air, allowing it to cross gaps in the road. Violet fields inverse the control (pushing the joystick to the left moves your ball to the right and vice versa). The „road“ is not the full six fields wide, as holes make it smaller or require it to jump.<br><br>Each player has a limited amount of jumps, which can be triggered without a jump field and those jumps are badly required at certain level spots. Falling of the costs some time until your ball is placed back on the road and in full speed. If the end of the level is not reached in a given time limit time, the game is over.<br><br>The game is always starting in two-player mode with vertically splitted screen, but progress of both players is independent, so a single player can continue the race if the second player is out, which is basically a single-player mode. High-scores are saved to disk.",
