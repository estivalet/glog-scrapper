  "description": "A simple variation of the classic game of  Mahjongg (also known as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Shanghai\">Shanghai</a>). Each of the 40 levels consist of rows and piles of tiles, patterned with symbols such as butterflies and masks. Pair them up within the time limit to move on a level. The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.",
