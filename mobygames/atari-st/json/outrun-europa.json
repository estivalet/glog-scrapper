  "description": "The third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/outrun\">OutRun</a> series, which revolutionised the third-person perspective style of racing games. The levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike other titles in the series, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the routes are dogged with other vehicles to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music.",
