  "description": "In <i>Boxy - Gambler</i> the player has to navigate his way from the lower left of the game screen to the upper right without stepping on a mine. The game area consists of 22x15 tiles all grey at the beginning (except the lower left tile, where the player stands and the upper right tile which is the goal. The player has no indication of which tiles that are safe to tread on and which are hiding mines. The number of mines increases with the level. Stepping on a mine results in a lost life, when all three lives are lost it's game over. For each completed level the player is awarded 10 points.",
