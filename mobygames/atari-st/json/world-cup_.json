  "description": "<i>World Cup</i> is a football management game. The player can choose to manage the team for England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales and the goal of the game is to make the chosen team win the world cup. Team morale plays an important part: winning a game will rise the morale and losing a game will lower it, if it reaches zero the player will be fired and that means game over. Every month the things to be done on certain days can be found in the diary. Every month usually starts with squad selection, except those in which there are a friendly game in then the player first have to choose which country to play against. There is a scout function that gives the player some info about other teams. When the days actions are done the player must press the &quot;Next day&quot;-button to advance the game.\n",
