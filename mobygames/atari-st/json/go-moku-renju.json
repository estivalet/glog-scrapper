  "description": "The Go-Moku (or also called Gomoku) board game is played on a 15x15 board with each player is allowed to place one stone at a time. The goal is to get a row of five stones in any direction (even diagonal). As it is proven that the starting player always can win if playing correctly, the Renju variant with slightly modified starting rules applies to prevent the advantage of the first player.<br><br>The game features both variants, it can even alter the board size (9x9, 11x11, 13x13 and 15x15). It comes with an AI that can be adjusted in playing levels (from 1 to 9). Also, help can be shown and there is an undo function for any turns.\n",
