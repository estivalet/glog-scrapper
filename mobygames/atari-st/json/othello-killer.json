  "description": "<i>Othello Killer</i> is, despite it's name, an ordinary Othello/Reversi implementation.<br><br>It features the usual board size and rules. Two players can play in hot-seat or a single player can play against the AI, which can be chosen from four difficulty levels.There is also a demo mode in which the computer plays against itself. A nice addition is that all fields with valid moves are marked. The player can get hints from the AI on demand, take back moves and also loading and saving of a game is available.",
