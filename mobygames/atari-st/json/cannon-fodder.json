  "description": "Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=5016597004326\">Lemmings</a> crossed with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=5012189081553\">Commando</a> crossed with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=5013715077965\">Dune 2</a>. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once). <br><br>Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.",
