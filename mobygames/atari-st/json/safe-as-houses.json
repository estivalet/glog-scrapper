  "description": "<i>Safe as Houses</i> is a version of the classic monopoly board game for one to eighth players written in GFA Basic. Just like in the original game you buy streets, build houses and try to drive your opponents to bankruptcy. The name of the streets can be British, Irish or American. On each turn the player(s) is presented with a menu with 7 choices: Build, Mortgage, Unmortgage, Trade, Information, Resign and Roll the dice. Classic monopoly rules apply such as you have to buy a free property when you land on it (if you can't afford it it will be auctioned out) and if you roll doubles three times in a row you have to go to jail (without passing go).",
