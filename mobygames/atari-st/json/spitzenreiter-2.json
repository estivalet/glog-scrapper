  "description": "<em>Spitzenreiter 2</em> is an enhanced successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/spitzenreiter\">Spitzenreiter</a>. In this football manager up to four players compete in league and cup competitions.<br><br>Gameplay is extended from the original version: training days can be assigned on a six week scheme for improving your squad. The financial possibilities are more flexible as in the predecessor, as more options are available: you can set ticket prices, chose sponsors and you can even invest some money in buying the press.<br><br>In contrast to the real club and player names featured in the older game, in <em>Spitzenreiter 2</em> both clubs and players are named with fantasy names, which can be edited. Major changes are made on the user interface, which is now featuring more icons and colors. Games can be saved. All texts are in German.",
