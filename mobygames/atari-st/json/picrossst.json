  "description": "<i>PicrossST</i> is a nonogramme puzzle game for the Atari ST, similar to Nintendo's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marios-picross\">Picross</a> series.<br><br>The player is presented with a grid, surrounded by numbers on the top and left sides. These numbers represent the number of squares on that row or column that shall be filled. On a 15x15 grid, a number fifteen means that the entire row or column should form a straight line across the grid, whereas the numbers ”10, 3” on the left mean that that row should have one line of 10 filled squares and another shorter line of 3 squares. These lines must have at least one blank square to separate them. Using deduction, it is possible to fill in all the right squares, thereby forming a simple picture.<br><br>The implementation in <i>PicrossST</i> starts out with the program choosing to reveal a row and column at random to help the player out. After that, he is on his own. Using the mouse, squares can either be coloured or marked as presumably empty, a bit like <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/minesweeper\">Minesweeper</a></i>. Marking a blank square as empty is punished with a time deduction, which means that you can trade time for hints.<br><br>Two players may play at once, but in a cooperative manner. The game also comes with a grids editor for constructing puzzles of your own.",
