  "description": "<i>Botics</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pong\">Pong</a> variant set in the future. It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.<br><br>Variations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode. ",
