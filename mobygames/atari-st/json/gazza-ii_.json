  "description": "This edition of the second game licensed around England footballer Paul Gascoigne combines arcade action and management. A four-division Super League of top European clubs is featured, with the potential for multiple managers to play. You can buy, scout for and sell players, and set up individual tactical systems.<br><br>The in-game action has a side-scrolling view and close ball control. The game is tolerant of tough tackles, as these are usually successful and rarely result in a foul. You can swerve, chip and head the ball in any direction.",
