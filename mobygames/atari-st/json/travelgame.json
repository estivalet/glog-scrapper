  "description": "The goal of <i>Travelgame</i> is to visit all of the 36 cities that are listed within the game. <br><br>First the player chooses a continent and then a home base. After that it is time to travel. The main game screen shows the current continent and a menu with 8 buttons: Home base, photo, money, time, game progress, Airport, travel and hotel. To finance the trip the player must take and sell photos. On the photo screen the player are presented with eight pictures (divided between two screens) and must click on the one that best resembles the place where the player currently is. If the player chooses to stay at a hotel he or she might meet a person that is willing to pay good for the right photos. Traveling is done by clicking on any of the available cities on the map screen. Visited cities will have a red outline around their names. \n",
