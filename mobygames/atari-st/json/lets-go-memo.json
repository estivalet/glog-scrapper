  "description": "<i>Let's Go Memo!</i> is a memory game written in GFA BASIC 3.5. The game can be played by one or two players and is controlled by the mouse. Let's Go Memo comes with four different sets of cards (Alphabet, Couleur, Kanji and standard) but since the card-files are in PI1-format you can easily create your own set of cards (there is even a template-file included so that you get the right size for the cards). The game area consists of 6 x 10 memory cards.",
