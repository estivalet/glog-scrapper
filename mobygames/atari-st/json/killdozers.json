The blue bullets attacks the armour of the tanks, the green the shield and the red the life. When you reduce armour, shield or life points from your opponent, you increase your own. This opens up new strategic possibilities like for example, eating the shield of an opponent with green bullets to better kill it with the red ones.The opponents are able to fight together using a number of strategies.",
