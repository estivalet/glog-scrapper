  "description": "<i>Mr Dice</i> is a puzzle game written in STOS. You control Mr Dice at the bottom of the screen and you have to arrange dice in the right combination to make them disappear and get points. By removing dice in specific order you can create combos which gives you extra points. You may choose freely how many eyes it should be on the die you are about to use. As the game progresses the dice will move downwards and when they reach the bottom of the screen it's game over.",
