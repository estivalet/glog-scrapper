  "description": "<i>Outlands</i> is a rather straightforward vertical shoot 'em up. It does not feature any elaborated background story. The basic statement in the manual just claims: &quot;Kill everything&quot;.<br><br>The game can be played with two players simultaneously. Several extra weapons can be gathered on shooting enemy ships: shields, extra lives, double fire which double your shooting power, weapons that fire to the side and many more.\n",
