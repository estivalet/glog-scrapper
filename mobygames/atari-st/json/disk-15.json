  "description": "<i>Disk 15</i> is a compilation of 15 games on a single disk. Most games are board-game conversions, but also some arcade games and a drawing program are included in the collection.\n<ul>\n<li>3D Noughts &amp; Crosses</li>\n<li>Sliding Blocks</li>\n<li>Solitaire</li>\n<li>49er</li>\n<li>Hangman</li>\n<li>MasterMind</li>\n<li>Othello</li>\n<li>Draughts</li>\n<li>Astro Dodge</li>\n<li>STDoodler (drawing program)</li>\n<li>Heli Bomber</li>\n<li>Sub Hunter</li>\n<li>Rally Driver</li>\n<li>Balloon Crazy</li>\n<li>Diamante Sid</li>\n</ul>\nControl is very different through the games: some board games are controlled by the mouse, others by positional arguments typed on the keyboard, while the arcade games are controlled by keyboard only (no joystick), but all with different key mappings, which cannot be changed. Most games can only be left by resetting the computer. None of the games feature sound effects or music, only the keyboard ping of the operating system is present.",
