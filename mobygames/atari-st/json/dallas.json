  "description": "<i>Dallas</i> is a game for 2 to 6 players where you try to lead the most profitable oil company. Every player starts with $300,000 in cash. The first task is to buy an oil field (there are 12 in the game) and then some drilling equipment. When you find oil you have to buy a tank car firm and some tank car's. After each players turn he/she gets to decide the amount of oil to sell this week, the maximum value is decided by how much oil and how many tank cars the player have. The richest player after 52 weeks (a year) wins. If the competitors are doing too well one can always try to sabotage his/her operation.",
