  "description": "<em>Premium Mah Jongg</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Card+%2f+Tile+game+-+Shanghai+%2f+Solitaire+mahjongg\">Shanghai</a> implementation. It features the &quot;Turtle&quot; layout for stones and the standard 144 stone set.<br><br>There are two game modes. In &quot;Solitaire&quot; mode, you simply can play without any time pressure while in &quot;Tournament&quot; mode you have, with increasing difficulty, between 12 and 4 minutes to clear the board. If you get any advice from the program to show possible moves, the high score is frozen at this time. If there are no more possible moves left, the game is instantly ended. You can repeat the last move. The high-score table is saved to disk.<br><br>The game is running on all GEM machines, with tile sets in monochrome and 16-colors. Especially the monochrome high-res resolution of the Atari TT is supported.",
