  "description": "Superbike Challenge brings 1000cc motorbikes to life for a one or two player race. Unusually, the screen is split horizontally, with your action only ever using half of the screen. You can play a full season of races, or run at one of the 12 tracks as a stand-alone race (including Assen, Mugello, the old Hockenheim and Spa). A manual gearbox option and 3 skill levels ensure that you can't master the game immediately. Full information on your speed and revs, the race order and course layout are on screen at all times.<br><br>Superbike Challenge is an updated version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=grand-prix-500-cc\">Grand Prix 500 cc</a>, with a better menu and title screen and some different in-game graphics.",
