  "description": "<i>ST Keno</i> is a keno simulation in low or high resolution for one player. You may select 1 to 15 out of 80 numbers and hope that yours will be selected when the computer chooses the 20 winning ones. You start with $1000 in cash and may bet between $1 and so much money you have each game. Depending on how many numbers you have selected the number of needed correct one varies from 1 to 7. Selecting more numbers gives you chance to win more money. Once you win you may choose to try to double the money won; you have to guess if the number the computer selects will be odd or even.",
