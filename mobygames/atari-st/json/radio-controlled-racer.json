  "description": "Although purporting to feature radio controlled cars, this is essentially a standard <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a> style racing game, which one or two players can join in. It's viewed from above, with the races lasting for 4 laps of close-quarters racing between 4 cars, with the computer providing the extras.There are 8 basic circuit layouts, featuring bridges, tight short-cuts, chicanes and hairpins.There are also arrow-shaped patches of ice which can cause the car to get away from you.The race ends when the leader finishes, with the other cars frozen on the spot and given their final positions based on where they are in that millisecond",
