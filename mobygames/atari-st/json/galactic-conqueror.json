  "description": "As rebel forces close in on the space station Gallion, you launch strikes against enemy-controlled planets in the most sophisticated techno-toy available to mankind, the space fighter Thunder Cloud II. <br><br>The game is a blend of action sequences in an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Afterburner\">Afterburner</a>-esque pseudo-3D view. These sequences vary between ground combat, aerial combat and space combat, with different motion physics and enemy craft. There is also a strategic battle choices on a galactic map invaded in real-time.<br><br>The PC version uses speaker tweaks to recreate the game's tune on theoretically-inferior hardware.",
