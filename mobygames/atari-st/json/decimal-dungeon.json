  "description": "<i>Decimal Dungeon</i> is a educational math game for one or two players.<br><br>Designed to teach students about decimals and fractions, the player must help navigate a man through a haunted dungeon. Numerous stalagmites block the player's path, but if the player correctly answers a math question, the stalagmites will temporarily lower to the ground allowing the player to pass.  If the player answers incorrectly, they are dumped through a trap door by a bat. The goal is to reach the top of the levels by continuously answering questions correctly. It contains three levels of difficulty, and a variety of different math problems including converting fractions, decimals, and percentages, as well as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions.",
