  "description": "Sissy and Sassy have lost their playing card deck. On a journey through <em>Heartland</em> they try to get all the lost cards. In this platform game, the goal is to find the lost cards, hidden in a huge area scrolling in all eight directions. Some cards can be found directly on platforms, other are hidden behind one of the nine magic doors, which are also acting as teleporters to other locations of the game map. The player can jump and should avoid spikes on the ground as they drain energy. Energy can be refilled by some of the bottles lying around (not all regain energy). If energy dropped to zero, the game ends. Beside finding all the cards, there are also 273 gold coins spread over the complete map, which can be searched and collected for points.<br><br>There are no enemies or moving obstacles in the levels, so exploration of the levels can be done without fear (except the spikes). The player can change between Sissy and Sassy during the game, as well as saving and loading games. A high-score table can be reached and is saved on disk. On STE machines, a sample is playing in a loop.",
