  "description": "<i>Verminator</i> is a platformer in which the player takes the control of Jake, an exterminator. The basic idea is that he walks and jumps through the game world and kills all vermin he meets. A radar routes him to the infested areas and teleports help to shorten the way. Every week, indicated by a time limit, he receives money for every killed vermin and the game can be saved. Said money can be reinvested in shops to buy useful items like weapons, extra lives or a permission to use the teleports. If money runs out, he can lend it at a bank in return to heavy interests. An alternative way to gain money is gambling in the casino.",
