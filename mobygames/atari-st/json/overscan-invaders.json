  "description": "<i>Overscan Invaders</i> is a Space Invaders clone that relies on the overscan technique giving the player 32 colors on the screen at the same time (instead of 16) and at a higher resolution than the standard one. <br><br>Gameplay is straight forward: a large group of aliens moves from side to side on the screen and you have to destroy them all before they reach the bottom of the screen. For every alien you destroy the rest will move a bit faster. Now and then a flying saucer will move across the top of the screen, shooting it will give you bonus points. You have to watch out for the aliens lasers, you have three shield blocks that will protect you but they wont last forever.",
