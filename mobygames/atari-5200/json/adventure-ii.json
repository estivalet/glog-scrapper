  "description": "This homebrew Atari 5200 cartridge is a direct, yet unofficial sequel to the Atari 2600 action role-playing classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/adventure\">Adventure</a>. The player controls an unnamed knight on a quest to return the stolen chalice to the Seashore Kingdom's Castle. Like the original, <i>Adventure II</i> is played from top-down perspective, with player roaming the large game world.. The player character can carry one item at a time which are used to solve puzzles.\nWhile the main player graphic remains a square, the world of <i>Adventure II</i> is far larger and more robust than the original. The game's 32k cartridge features 4 distinct kingdoms, complete with unique inhabitants, items and secrets.",
