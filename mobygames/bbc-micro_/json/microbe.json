  "description": "<i>Microbe</i> is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where Earth once again is being threatened by an alien attack. What's different this time however is that the battle takes place inside the alien. After all attempts with conventional weapons have failed a micro organism is entering the alien's bloodstream in an attempt to kill it from within. <br><br>The player takes control of the microbe (which looks more like some sort of insect) and shoots at the various cells, antibodies, aminos and spores inside the alien. The microbe can be moved left and right but also up and down. Each level has its own enemies with its own appearance and movement pattern. In addition to blasting away at the enemies the player also has to watch out for the projectiles that they drop. The player has three lives and when they are used up the game is over.",
