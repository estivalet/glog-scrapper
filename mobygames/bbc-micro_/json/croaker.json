  "description": "<i>Croaker</i> is a classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/frogger\">Frogger</a> clone. The objective is to get frogs across the motorway and the polluted river to a safe lair by dodging between the traffic and leaping from logs to turtles without falling in. A level is completed by filling five lairs at the top of the screen, resulting in a more difficult level including new and faster obstacles. Every upward jump gives 10 points, every frog in a safe zone gives 100 points. If the bonus counter reaches zero, the player loses a life.",
