  "description": "<i>Mr. Ee!</i> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mr-do\">Mr. Do!</a> The gameplay is very much the same and features a wizard that has to make tunnels through the earth in an attempt to collect all the cherries. At the same time he has to watch out for the chasing bad guys called umphs who will kill him upon contact. The umphs can be killed by either throwing a crystal ball which bounces around the tunnels until it hits something or by making apples fall down onto them. Only one crystal ball can be used at a time and thereafter the player has to wait for another one to appear.<br><br>Umphs that get stuck turns into diggers which can digs its own tunnels through the earth. There are also letter monsters who appear after every 5000 points and each has a letter spelling the word extra. When all five has been killed an extra life is given. Once all umphs have left their base in the centre some food will appear. If it is picked up all enemies will halt in their tracks and instead the maras will appear from the letter monster. The maras eat apples that block their path and when killed they turn into apples. When the letter monster or all the maras have been killed the regular enemies come to live again. A level is completed by either killing all the umphs or by eating all the cherries. ",
