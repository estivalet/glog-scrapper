  "description": "<i>Clockwise</i> is an educational game that allows children to practice telling time. The aim of the game is to repair a damaged time travel ship. The player is stranded at the beginning of Earth time and has to return to the present. The ship has twenty holes that have to be fixed and each has a time exercise that has to be completed. After a hole is repaired the ship will move a little forward through time. The scene outside is described and the player has to figure out the time to continue. Each of the twenty exercises is its own puzzle and include setting and telling time, arranging days and months and using a calendar. There is also a sliding block puzzle and a word square puzzle. ",
