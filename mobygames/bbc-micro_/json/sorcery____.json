  "description": "No relation to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/sorcery\">the more well-known arcade adventure</a>, <i>Sorcery</i> for the BBC is an arcade platformer in the same vein as <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a></i>. You, in the shape of a hooded swordsman, must climb four floors of platforms to reach an evil magician who has taken your wife captive. While there are only four stairs to scale, it is a difficult task because of the ghosts, fire-breathing birds, arrows and flying magical balls. You must alternate between using your sword or jumping across them, or fooling the ghosts by going to a lower platform, then up again.<br><br>One peculiarity about <i>Sorcery</i> is that if you are hit, you don't immediately lose your life. Instead, you are transformed into a frog, sitting at the bottom of the screen, and your wife is given the opportunity to climb down to the bottom to free you from the spell.",
