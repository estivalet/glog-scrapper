  "description": "<i>Yie Ar Kung-Fu 2: The Emperor Yie-Gah</i> is a sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/yie-ar-kung-fu_\">MSX / Famicom (NES) version</a> of <i>Yie Ar Kung-Fu</i>, rather than the versions directly based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cpc/yie-ar-kung-fu\">arcade release</a>. The game follows the quest of Lee Young, the main character from the previous game, to become a kung-fu master. This involves fighting with a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Lee Young has a wide range of attack moves he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well equipped with unique weapons and attacks.",
