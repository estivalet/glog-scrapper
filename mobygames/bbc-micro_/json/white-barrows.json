  "description": "This is a text based game that has elements from a multiple genres dungeon crawl, puzzle, logic challenge, and even resource management.\nThe back story is about a bad wizard who's stolen a magic chalice and you play the plucky adventurer who has to get it back. The bad guy is hiding in the ancient burial grounds, or barrows.\nThe game is based on a map of the barrows in which there are 40 or so rooms. You are dropped randomly into a room. In other rooms are gnomes, trolls, dragons etc and in one room is the wizard.\nThe game is played by moving from room to room exploring. \nYou may view connecting rooms. \nYou may raise a magic wall in an adjacent room. \nHowever you have only 400 magic points and viewing or raising a wall costs points so it's important to find the wizard before points run out.\nThe game is a text game. There is only one graphic which is the map that shows how the rooms are connected.<br><br>\n",
