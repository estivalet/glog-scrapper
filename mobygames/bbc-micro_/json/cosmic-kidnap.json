  "description": "<i>Cosmic Kidnap</i> is a variant of the arcade shoot 'em up <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/cosmic-guerilla\">Cosmic Guerilla</a>. The objective of the game is to prevent aliens from freeing three captives from a prison. As the aliens appear from the sides the player has to shoot them down before they start tearing down the prison. If they manage to reach a prisoner they attempt to take it away and if they succeed the player loses one life. Once all the attackers have been killed the game moves on to the next level. For the third level a bug creature will appear. It is smart enough to follow the player and drop bombs and only a hit on its outer extremities will kill it. The game ends when the player has lost all three lives.",
