  "description": "<i>Words, Words, Words</i> is an educational game for practising reading and spelling. When starting out the player selects which of the game's eight scenes to begin with. Once moving to the chosen scene the player is shown objects and has to type the correct words. Once an object has been correctly spelled it takes its place in the scene. If all objects in a scene are spelled correctly the scene will come to life through animations. Each scene (except for the castle) ends with the player getting to select the next scene to move to. If an answer is wrong the player gets another chance to get it right, if still wrong the word is spelled out and the game moves on.",
