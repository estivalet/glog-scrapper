  "description": "<i>Alien Swirl</i> is a fixed screen shoot 'em up in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/moon-cresta\">Moon Cresta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Phoenix\">Phoenix</a>. The player controls his ship down the base line and has to shoot at the aliens swirling around above him. There are a number of aliens for each stage and the player has to shoot them all down to move on to the next stage. The first wave has only three aliens but as the player progresses through the waves the number of aliens increases. There is also a mother ship similarly to the one in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> that occasionally moves across the screen. After every four waves there is a refuelling stage where the player has to dock his ship with a tanker. This works similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lunar+Lander\">Lunar Lander</a>. Bonus points are awarded depending on how well this is done and at every 10000 points the player earns a bonus life.",
