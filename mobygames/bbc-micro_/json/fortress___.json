  "description": "<i>Fortress</i> is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=SEGA\">SEGA's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zaxxon\">Zaxxon</a>, copying many elements of the original game. Using a scrolling isometric perspective, players need to guide a space ship through a course. It is filled with enemies such as stationary turrets, space ships and rockets launching from the ground. There are also many obstacles that need to be avoided. Instead of merely shooting anything that moves the player also needs to shoot fuel barrels to combat the dwindling fuel supply. The ship is also able to move up and down into the air. That way many hazards can be avoided, but it consumes a lot of fuel. Flying higher is often needed to move over walls and pass through narrow gates. When the game is completed it immediately restarts. The player has three lives.",
