  "description": "<i>Castle of Riddles</i> is a single player text adventure. <br><br>The player takes the role of a lone adventurer sitting on a bench in an inn. Business isn't what it used to be and getting a steady job is looking like a viable option when a job offer appears. The offer comes from a tall wizard with silver hair whose castle has been taken over by a warlock. The wizard wants the warlock removing and the safe return of his ring of power. Any treasure found along the way can be kept. Naturally you're interested and as soon as those words leave your lips the wizard casts a spell that has you flying through the air towards his castle. <br><br>This is a text adventure. The game will only accept commands that are in upper case. It understands commands such as NORTH and NORTHEAST and will also accept N &amp; NE as abbreviations. The game documentation does not give a complete list of the available commands, part of the game is trying different one and two word commands to see what works.<br><br>Points are scored for locating treasure and depositing it in a safe. The maximum score is 250 points with anything over 200 being considered an expert score.",
