  "description": "<i>Number Balance</i> is an educational math game. It consists of two programs: one with addition and subtraction, the other with multiplication and division. The game is built around a balance scale where one arm has the equation and the other has the outcome. One number is unknown and it's the player's task to enter it. If successful the scale will be balanced. The game is designed for school use and starts with a part where the teacher can customize the program. This include the layout of the equation, which operators to include, the number of highest bond and how much time each pupil should get.",
