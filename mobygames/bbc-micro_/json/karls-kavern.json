  "description": "Karl has inherited a disused treasure mine from an uncle. However as he enter the mine everything goes wrong and a rock fall causes the entrance to be blocked with no other exit in sight. He soon finds that collecting all the boxes in a cavern automatically transports him to the next one. Now it's up to the player to help him do this by guiding him through all the game's thirty caverns.<br><br><i>Karls Kavern</i> is a platformer in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Manic+Miner\">Manic Miner</a>. It consists of thirty single screen levels where the objective in each is to simply collect all the boxes that lies scattered around. To make it the player has to jump between platforms (including moving ones) and avoid getting touched by any of the dangers that exist in the underground. Any contact will lead to a loss of life and so will a long fall. Part of the levels are also collapsing platforms and conveyor belts. The player has five lives and when they are all used up the game ends.<br><br>In addition to playing all the levels in sequence there is also a practice mode that allows the player to try out all the levels except the last one.
