  "description": "In <i>Diamond Mine II</i> the player must collect diamonds from underground shafts using a vacuum cleaner.<br><br>\nA shaft, or level, consists of corridors and alleyways that fills the screen through which the player must manoeuvre their vacuum hose. All gems collected are sucked to the top of the mine for storage. \nThe harvesting task is made more difficult by the monsters who inhabit the mine. They will appear and will attack the vacuum hose. Any contact they make with the hose will cost a life. The player can suck the monsters up with the hose by attacking them from the side. This scores bonus point but does not kill the monsters who will re-appear.\nLives can also be lost if the player tries to cross the path of the hose or goes back on themselves.<br><br>A level is completed when all the diamonds have been collected.<br><br>There are twenty shafts / levels to the game and each is progressively harder - after level ten the shaft becomes invisible!\n",
