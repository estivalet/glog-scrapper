  "description": "<i>Scavenger Hunt</i> is a 1 - 4 player educational game involving movement and directions.<br><br>The goal of each player is to find 5 items hidden within a rural farm setting.  For example, if the player is tasked with finding sand, they must look along the small beach on the map.  Players take turns moving about the farm by selecting from 8 directions, and the distance they wish to travel from 1 - 40.  The goal of each player is to optimize their route, so that they can collect the 5 items before their opponents do.  Fences and bridges complicate travel.  The player can only collect an item when they stand directly atop an appropriate location. <br><br>",
