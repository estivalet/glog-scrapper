  "description": "<i>Crazy Painter</i> is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Amidar\">Amidar</a>. It initially had the same name, but was renamed to avoid legal difficulties before its release by Superior. The player controls a creature and needs to paint levels divided into rectangles of various sizes. They are painted by moving over the bordering edges, colouring them. When a rectangle is traced entirely, it is filled with a colour. Meanwhile enemies that roam the edges need to be avoided. There is also a limited amount of jumps used to get out of tricky situations. The character has a number of lives and the game keeps tracks of the score.",
