  "description": "<i>Apple Pie</i> is a single screen action game where the player controls a tank and has to kill invading aliens. The setting is an American village which is being attacked by waves of aliens who attempt to steal the stars of the national flag. The player's task is to stop them by shooting them before they reach the bottom of the screen where the flag is located. The game is played in a grid-like maze which is viewed from a top down perspective. The tank can be moved forward and turn left and right but only at junctions between buildings. The player has three lives but loses one when colliding with an alien or getting shot. A life is also lost when driving over the flag or letting the aliens get away with all the stars.",
