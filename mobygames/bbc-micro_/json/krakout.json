  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a>-style <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a> clone, which unlike most other similar games has the bat on the side of the screen (there is a left/right option) instead of at the bottom.  There are 100 screens to be conquered.<br><br>There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life).  Extra lives are also awarded when the player scores 10,000 points.<br><br>The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!",
