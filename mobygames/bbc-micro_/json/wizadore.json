  "description": "Long ago, the normally peaceful land of Wizadore was invaded by the evil dragon Smaun. The arch mage of the land constructed a magical sword to help defeat the foul wyrm, but during the attempt the sword was smashed and broken into three pieces. Now, decades later, the mage's grandson sets out to roam the land, find the three pieces of the sword, and put it together again to finally defeat the beast.<br><br>The player controls the young mage on his quest in this side-scrolling platformer. The pieces of the sword are scattered all over Wizadore, which consists of a large number of screens, set over different levels connected by stairs. Hindering the mage's exploration of the surroundings (involving ladder-climbing and gap-jumping) are guards, armed with axes or bows and arrows; some of them even ride flying creatures. At the beginning, the mage is helpless, but on the way he can pick up magical scrolls which allow him to cast spells (like lightning or fire) to crush the opposition.",
