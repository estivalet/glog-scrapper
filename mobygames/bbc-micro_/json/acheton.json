  "description": "<i>Acheton</i> is a home computer conversion of the mainframe adventure of the same name. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zork\">Zork</a> (which was released on the VAX mainframe not long before <i>Acheton's</i> original appearance), it is a fantasy treasure hunt set in a claustrophobic dungeon. It boasts over 400 rooms and 200 objects, thereby making it much bigger than <i>Zork</i>.  <br><br>As with many games of this kind the most time is spent by exploring the environment and solving item-based puzzles. Everything is described solely with plain text and the player interacts with the game by typing in phrases which describe his desired action, e.g. &quot;take bottle&quot;. It also features a help function with graded hints.",
