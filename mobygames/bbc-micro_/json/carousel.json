  "description": "<i>Carousel</i> is a clone of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/carnival\">Carnival</a> which is a fixed screen shoot 'em up with a amusement park theme. The player controls a gun down the bottom of the screen and has to shoot the targets that move back and forth above him in three rows. The player has a limited amount of bullets and when out of them the game ends. The targets are made up of three different animals: ducks, rabbits and owls as well as letters of the word BONUS. Hitting the letters in the correct order and a bonus score is given for each. Ducks are special as they might swoop down towards the player and the player has to shoot them before they land or else he will lose bullets.<br><br>In addition to the targets there is also a rotating wheel at the top of the screen and all of its spokes has to be shot to complete a level. Once everything on the screen has been shot the player moves on to a bonus round featuring a polar bear. It will move across the screen and the player has to shoot it as many times as possible. For every hit the bear reverses his direction and increases his speed until it escapes and the player moves on to the next level. ",
