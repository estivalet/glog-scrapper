  "description": "<i>Meteor Mission</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/lunar-rescue___\">Lunar Rescue</a> variant. The player controls an emergency space capsule which has be to be used to rescue six astronauts stranded on an alien planet. The player starts in a mothership at the top of the screen from which he has to descend down to the surface where the astronauts are waiting. But to succeed he has to navigate his way through a field of meteors and land on one of two platforms at the surface. The player can control the capsule left and right and use thrust to slow down the speed. In addition to the meteors there is also an alien pursuit ship that launches missiles at the player. Once an astronaut has entered the capsule it's time to go back up. Unlike the original arcade game it's the same field of meteors that the player has to move through. The player can now use a gun to shoot at the meteors. When all six astronauts have been rescued the player gets a bonus and moves on to the next level. ",
