  "description": "<i>L: A Mathemagical Adventure</i> is an educational text adventure game that contains mathematical and logical puzzles. The game begins with the player character finding himself outside an old palace. A man dressed as an abbot appears and enters the palace. If the player follows him he will ask for help in finding a girl called Runia who has been captured by the palace's Grey Dogos.<br><br>From there on the player navigates the palace in search for the missing girl by entering the typical text adventure commands: north, south, up, down etc to move between rooms and verb/noun combinations to interact with the environment. At times Drogo robot guards will appear and to get pass them the player has to enter the correct number, which is the square root of the number that is written on their chests. Other puzzles involve turning on spotlights in the correct colours by pulling accompanying switches, filing a key to fit four different key holes and planting nine trees so that there are ten rows with three trees in each row.",
