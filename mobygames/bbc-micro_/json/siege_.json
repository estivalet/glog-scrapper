  "description": "<i>Siege</i> is a simple arcade game where the player is defending a medieval castle. You stand at the top of the castle wall and have to throw stones at the attackers who are climbing up the wall. Often you will be able to take down multiple enemies as one falling man catches another. As time goes by the enemies will move faster and faster. When the enemy reaches the top of the wall the game is over. The more attackers you knock off the higher score you'll get.",
