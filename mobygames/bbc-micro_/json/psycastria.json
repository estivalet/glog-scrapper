  "description": "The Psycastrians have attacked. Using their mind control abilities, they have taken over many world leaders, causing untold war and devastation. Now it is up to you to strike back. Take your fighter across 16 bases, on land, on sea, on the moon, and in space.<br><br><i>Psycastria</i> is a top-down horizontal scrolling shooter. Go across each base, destroy the 10 energy pods that power the Psycastrian war machine while avoiding buildings and engaging alien spacecraft, then go to the next base. Unusually for a shooter, you can turn around at any time to go after any missed targets. Between bases, there is a bonus level that tests your timing at destroying aliens.",
