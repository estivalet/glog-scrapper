  "description": "Four men are stranded on the side of an erupting volcano and it's up to the player to rescue them with his emergency helicopter. <i>Volcano</i> consists of a single side view screen where the crater is located in the middle, the helicopter's landing platform on the right and the men to be rescued on the left. What the player has to do is fly over the volcano, pick up the men one at a time and return them to the platform. This is not an easy task since a large amount of boulder are hurled from the crater and these have to be either shot or avoided. Touching a boulder or crashing into the ground will lead to the helicopter being destroyed and the player loses one life. As if this isn't enough the player has to work quickly since molten lava is pouring from the mouth of the volcano down towards the stranded men. If a man dies he will turn into a ghost which will go after the player. Ghosts have to be avoided since they are indestructible. The player has three helicopters and gets an extra one after 5,000 points scored. ",
