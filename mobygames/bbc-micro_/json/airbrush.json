  "description": "<i>Airbrush</i> is a single screen action game where the player is in control of a paintbrush which is moved around the screen in an attempt to colour as much of it as possible. About a third of the screen has to be painted to advance to the next level. Paint is limited however and therefore the player has to pick up the paint pots that are scattered around the screen. It is also necessary to avoid the obstacles that stand in the way. There are two different obstacles, guards and radioactive bins, but they differ only in appearance. The player starts with three lives and loses one when running out of paint or when running into one of the obstacles or the surrounding walls. The ZX Spectrum version also features a thief that appear on level 2. It will attempt to steal paint pots and wipe out paint but the player can stop it by firing at it. ",
