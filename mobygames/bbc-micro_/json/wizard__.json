  "description": "<i>The Wizard</i> is an action game where the player takes control of said wizard. It all happens by a sea where five princesses are located on five islands while the wizard stands on a cliff on the left side of the screen. Now the wizard's job is to protect the princesses from demons that appear in the sky and descends towards the sea. To shoot down the demons the wizard uses his wand. The controls are simple with two buttons used to rotate the wand while another is used for shooting. The magic is limited though and once used up there is no way to take down the attackers. After all demons have been killed the player earns bonus points depending on how many of the princesses remain standing. A new and tougher wave of demons will then appear.",
