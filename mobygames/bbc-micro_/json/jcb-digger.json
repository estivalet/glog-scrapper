  "description": "<i>JCB Digger</i> is a game where the player is in control of a JCB 3CX Excavator Loader. It is played from a top down perspective and scrolls in four directions with the player being able to drive the vehicle freely around the islands where it is set. On the islands there are meanies, blob-like creatures that the player has to put to sleep. There are two ways to do so. The first way involve digging holes with the backhoe and as the meanies walk into the hole the player quickly has to fill them again with the shovel. The other way to get rid of one is to use the shovel to push it into a salt water sea. If the player is not careful the meanies might capture the JCB and drive away with it which leads to a life being lost.<br><br>Putting eight meanies to sleep leads to a new set appearing. The new ones are of a different colour and are able to pass over landscape that the previous colour could not. In addition to capturing the meanies the player can earn points by shovelling away the landscape. There are three different types of landscape that can be shovelled: undergrowth, marsh and stony ground. When all of the landscape has been cleared from the island the player gets to move on to the another island. There are two islands and the starting one is randomly selected. ",
