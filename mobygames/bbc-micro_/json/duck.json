  "description": "<i>Duck</i> is a fixed screen shoot 'em up influenced by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Arcade\">Space Invaders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Arcade\">Galaxians</a>.<br>\nInstead of alien invaders and rocket ships we have farmer Tubby and the ducks that try to hit him on the head. Occasionally a swan flies over at the top of the screen that can be hit for a bonus.<br>\nBy the second level the ducks start to lay eggs that if get to the ground will hatch new ducks that take flight and bounce around the screen.",
