The doctor is a humanoid alien who travels through space and time on the TARDIS, which appears on the outside as a blue 1950s British police box.  You must create a time key and take it to the centre of the universe to create &quot;the second age of time&quot;. This has to be done within a time limit of an hour through four different sections which are variations on popular early video games.  <ul><li><i>The Labyrinth of Death</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> clone where you must collect three pieces of the time key while avoiding enemies - the evil weevils of Ourouborous Vl.</li><br>\n<li><i>The Prison</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Frogger\">Frogger</a>-like game where you must get from the bottom to the top of the screen while avoiding various enemies or jump on objects to cross water.</li><br>\n<li><i>The Terrordactyls</i> is similar to the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Phoenix\">Phoenix</a> where you are a space ship at bottom of screen shooting at winged enemies above.
