  "description": "<i>Q-Master</i> is an eight ball pool game for one or two players. The game is played from a top down perspective and uses keyboard controls. Taking a shot is done in two steps. In the first one the player sets the direction by moving a cross hair around the table while in the second the spin is set by moving a cross hair over the ball. The player can also increase and decrease the power and cue angle. When done pressing return takes the shot. When setting up a game it's possible to choose the level of the AI and the number of frames to be played.<br><br>In addition to the main eight ball mode there are three other game variations available. The practice session is a free mode without any rules where the player can rack balls and are able to pick up any ball at any time. The high speed attempt mode is a timed game where the player has to pot all balls on the table as quickly as possible to get a high score. Finally, in the high break attempt mode the player has to pot as many balls in a row as possible. ",
