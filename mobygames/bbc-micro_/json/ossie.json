  "description": "<i>Ossie</i> is a single screen action game where the player is in control of an osprey. The osprey has five chicks located in a nest at the top of a tree located on the left side of the screen and the player's task is to feed them with fish to prevent them from starving. At the bottom of the screen is a river where fish swim in lines from left to right. Fish are caught by positioning the osprey at the right height and pressing the fire button to make it dive. The height decides which row of fish can be reached. Once a fish has been caught it has to be flown and dropped into the nest. The time is limited and if the fish is not delivered within twenty seconds a chick will die. Additionally there is a poacher that occasionally climbs the tree in an attempt to steal a chick. When it happens the osprey has to fly into it to make it fall down or a life will be lost.",
