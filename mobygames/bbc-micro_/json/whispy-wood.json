  "description": "<i>Whispy Wood</i> is an educational text adventure game where the player takes the role of a caterpillar exploring a forest. The program is in two parts. Part 1 is purely explorative with the player moving from screen to screen by entering directions of movement. Each screen has text describing the surroundings as well as some graphics. Part 2 is called The Test of Fellowship and adds various dangers with multiple ways for the caterpillar to get killed (e.g. getting eaten by a predator or drowning in a pond). Interacting with the game is done with the following commands: climb, dig, still, wriggle, eat, sniff, listen, hide, bristle, scream as well as directional commands (N, S, E, W).",
