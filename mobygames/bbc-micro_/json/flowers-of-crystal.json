  "description": "<i>Flowers of Crystal</i> is an educational game from the author of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Granny%27s+Garden\">Granny's Garden</a>. The game was designed to provide for creative activities in the classroom and is built around puzzle-solving. It consists of three parts: an introductory story and an adventure in two parts. A password from the first part is required to start the second. The introductory story is also included recorded on an audio tape as well as printed in a booklet.<br><br>The game takes place on the planet Crystal which once had vast expanses of colourful flowers that are now thought to be extinct. The player is a visitor from Earth who explores the planet in an attempt to find the last remaining flower. In the first part, the player has to find four objects (special water, gold pot, fertiliser and soil). The gameplay involves travelling between seven locations (centre, city, factory, forest, lake, desert and mountains) and choosing which items to carry. The game starts out at the centre where the player chooses four items from three different menus. Items are needed when visiting some of the locations or give some protection when encountering hazards or some of the world's hostile creatures. The second part involves finding six parts of a flower dream to recreate a complete flower picture and then go to a castle. To progress it is necessary to obtain spells and use them at the right location.",
