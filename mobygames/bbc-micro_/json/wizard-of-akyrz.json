  "description": "<i>The Wizard of Akyrz</i> is the eighth game in the <i>Mysterious Adventures</i> series. The player begins in the royal palace, where the king asks him to save his daughter from an evil wizard. If the player should succeed, his reward will be priceless.<br><br>Most instructions are either 90-degree compass moves, or verb-noun commands such as &quot;get painting&quot;, &quot;fit chain&quot; or &quot;climb tree&quot;. On the player's journey he will discover treasures, which must be stored in a special room, reached via a spell. <br><br>The game engine has been redone to allow complete sentences, instead of the two-word <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Scott+Adams\">Scott Adams</a> parser that was used previously.",
