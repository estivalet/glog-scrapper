  "description": "In this text adventure, you play the role of Erik the Viking.  Upon returning home, you find your farm abandoned; your family has been kidnapped.  You gather the things you need for a journey, and go rescue them.<br><br>This game combines text adventure with graphics.  The graphics illustrate the places you go, and are drawn on the screen as you watch.  The display doesn't load a photo.  Rather, a pen races around the screen, drawing the pictures in.  While the picture is being drawn, the screen flickers.<br><br>Although the pictures slow the game down a bit, they are done in a style reminiscent of Viking-age farms. In one scene, you are placed in the center of a longhouse, and they show the depression in the floor, just as can be seen in books.<br><br>",
