  "description": "<i>Sphere of Destiny</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Trailblazer\">Trailblazer</a> variant. The game takes place on a series of freeways located in outer space which the player has to race a sphere across. On each level a finish point has to be reached before time runs out. The player can move the sphere left and right, increase and decrease the speed and bounce it. The routes are made up of tiles of different colors that affect the sphere in various ways. Blue and yellow tiles can be moved across without problems while black ones have to be avoided since touching them leads to time being lost. Red tiles lead to a slow down, green to a speed boost while magenta bounces the sphere. There are also white tiles that give bonuses and cyan tiles that reverse both the speed and the steering controls.",
