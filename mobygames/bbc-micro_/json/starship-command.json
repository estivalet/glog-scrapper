  "description": "<i>Starship Command</i> is a shooter where the player commands a starship and has to fend off small and large enemies. The larger ships have cloaking devices. To destroy the enemies you can shoot at them or ram them.\nThe starship is locked in the middle of the playarea, while the world rotates and moves around it. The starship shots have a limited range. The starship also has shields and a long range scanner, but only one of them can be active at a time.<br><br>Using any starship functions drain its energy bar. The bar automatically fills up, but fastest when standing still and not using the shield.<br><br>A special feature of your starship is the escape capsule. Should you be able to push the eject button before your ship gets destroyed and survive, the authorities will judge your performance and might give you another change at attacking the enemy. Or you might get retired - depending on your performance aka score.\n",
