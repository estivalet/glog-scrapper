  "description": "This is adventure #2 in Scott Adam's text adventure series.  In this adventure, you shuffle between three locales: an unremarkable (at first) London flat and two islands littered with dangerous critters and people.  The goal of the game is to find the two pirate treasures on the treasure island. You move about and use objects by typing one or two word commands such as NORTH, INVENTORY, or GET SNEAKERS.  You only have to type the first 3 letters of a command or object for the parser to recognize it.",
