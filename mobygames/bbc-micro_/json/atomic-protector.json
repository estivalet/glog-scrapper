  "description": "<i>Atomic Protector</i> is a fast-paced arcade title, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> but in reverse. The player (a robot in charge of a uranium deposit invaded by aliens) this time has to protect already laid down dots on the map instead of picking them up. The enemies are of two kinds: One will run around the map, picking up all the dots. If all dots are taken, the game is over. If there are remaining dots when the time is out, the level is completed and the game progresses to a faster, more difficult level. In order to protect the dots, the player may bump into this enemy, sending it the other way, or he may set up a portable wall to seal off the enemy's path. The other kind is radioactive, and a staggering warning tone sounds as it enters the maze. It must be caught before it contaminates you. Each new level is faster, and more challenges are added.",
