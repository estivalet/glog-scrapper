  "description": "<i>Android Attack</i> is an action game set in a maze where the player is pursued by attacking androids. These can be shot and will require one or several hits to kill. It is also possible to drop land mines and these can then be detonated when enemies pass them by. The player has an energy level that decreases with time. When it runs low the movement slows down and mines cannot be used. To increase the energy the player can eat dots that some enemies leave behind in the maze. Most enemies follow the corridors of the maze but there is also a yellow smiley that can move through walls.",
