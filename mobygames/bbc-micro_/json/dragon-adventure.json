  "description": "<i>Dragon Adventure</i> is a text adventure in a fantasy setting. It's up to the player to rid the land of a dragon. There are two ways to go about it: killing it with an enchanted sword, or using a magic pipe to remove its bewitchment. The eventual goal is to find the dragon's hidden hoard of treasure.<br><br>The game plays like a typical early treasure finding text adventure. The player moves from location to location by typing the direction of a compass and can find and interact with items which are used to solve puzzles.<br><br>Later releases of the game come with graphics.",
