  "description": "This BBC Micro version of <i>Revs</i> is the initial release of this Formula Three racing game. It only contains the Silverstone track. Players can do practice rounds on the track or participate in a championship, preceded by qualifying laps to determine the starting position. There are three difficulty levels to choose from and in the pits the front and rear wing settings can be changed.<br><br>Controlling the car is more complex than contemporary titles, with different keys for the gears, one for the gas and additional one to accelerate. It is also a pure simulation, much in the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,6244/\">Geoff Crammond's</a> later <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=MicroProse%2fCrammond+Grand+Prix+series\">Grand Prix series</a>; every contact with another car or missing a corner almost immediately leads to a crash.",
