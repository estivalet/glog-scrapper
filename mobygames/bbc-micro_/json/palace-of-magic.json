  "description": "<i>Palace of Magic</i> is an arcade game in which you have been imprisoned in an old palace of the wizard Caldeti, who has also reduced you to about half your usual height. You have to escape. To do this you have to find keys, to pass through doorways, and other objects which are needed to get past obstacles. To maintain your energy, which is diminished in various ways as you play, you need to collect top hats.",
