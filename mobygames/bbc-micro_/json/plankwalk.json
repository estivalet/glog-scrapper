  "description": "<i>Plankwalk</i> is a platform game where the player controls Scaffolding Sid whose planks goes berserk and start moving around. The planks move upwards and the aim of the game is simply to stay alive as long as possible by jumping between the plants and staying on the screen. Being carried to the top, running off the sides and falling to the bottom of the screen leads to a life being lost. Controls are limited to moving left and right, jumping and accelerating. Some monsters will appear and have to be avoided but can be killed by being ran into at high speed. Points can be earned by landing on blocks that the player falls through and by eating cherries. Some special planks exist such as the fake planks which disappear and sloping planks which slope either left or right.",
