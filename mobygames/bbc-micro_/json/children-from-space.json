  "description": "<i>Children From Space</i> is an educational game that teaches English spelling and grammar. It tells the story of two alien children who goes to earth to take a look around the planet and write a report to their captain. Unfortunately they are not very good at English and therefore need the player's assistance. The game has four episodes which teach a different aspect of the language. They are all played the same: an erroneous sentence is shown and the player has to type it in the correct way.<br><br>The first episode is the shops where spelling mistakes have to be corrected. The second episode is at a school where the tense of the sentences has to be changed. The third episode is at the seaside where sentences are jumbled up and the words has to be rearranged in the correct order. Finally there is the countryside where the most likely of two words has to selected and used in the sentence.",
