  "description": "<i>Painter</i> is a variation of the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Amidar\">Amidar</a> originally created for the arcades in 1981. <i>Painter</i>'s gameplay is very similar to <i>Amidar</i>'s bonus stages where the traditional boxes in the screen have points associated with. It can also be compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/potty-painter-in-the-jungle\">Potty Painter in the Jungle</a> which was one of the first <i>Amidar</i> variations for ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.<br><br><i>Painter</i>'s main goal is to fill all the boxes in each frame in a certain period of time by completing the pathways (lines) around them. This must be done before the &quot;Bonus&quot; value reaches zero. To complicate things the &quot;Painter&quot; has to avoid any collision with the &quot;Chasers&quot;, some entities present in the game that will try to intercept him and destroy his work. The &quot;Painter&quot; will be forced to restart the phase all over again and one of his lives will be lost in the process.<br><br>To defend himself during his gameplay and specially from the incredible speed the &quot;Chasers&quot; might get at the last skill factors of the game, the player has in his power a special tool: a gap creator. This weapon will create a temporary gap in the pathway lines preventing the &quot;Chasers&quot; from colliding with him. It can only be used three times at a time before any temporary gap is removed.<br><br>The limit of <i>Painter</i>'s skill factor is 6. &quot;Chasers&quot; intelligence and speed will increase proportionally to the skill factor and dramatically at this point of the gaming. Prepare yourself to be ambushed.\n",
