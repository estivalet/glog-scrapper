  "description": "The player takes the role of a researcher aboard the RV Kraken, a research vessel in search of a giant squid. The player performs many real-world marine research tasks, such as using a probe to measure water temperature and salinity and using a submersible to photograph sea life. It was primarily distributed to schools in order to teach players about Australian sea life, scientific research, and basic math skills. The various versions of this game were commonly played by Australian schoolchildren much like Odell Lake was in North America.",
