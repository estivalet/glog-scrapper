  "description": "<i>Danger UXB</i> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/check-man\">Check Man</a>. The player moves over a grid of squares and has to reach bombs before their counters reach zero and then explode. Each square can be moved over only once and thereafter it disappears. It is however possible to slide rows left and right and new squares will then appear. In addition to the bombs there are flags that can be collected and lethal skulls which have to be avoided. <br><br>There are three difficulty levels. On the second level the bombs have shorter countdowns and on the third level the stamping boots from the arcade game appear. These wander around the grid and will kill the player upon contact.",
