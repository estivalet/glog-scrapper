  "description": "<i>Protector</i> is an action game played from a top down perspective that can only be controlled with joystick. In the middle of the screen lies a number of pods and it's the player's objective to protect these from thieves that try to nick them. To stop a thief the player simply rams them by moving his ship over them. Double points are awarded if the thieves are killed after they have picked up pods and are leaving the screen. In addition to the thieves there are other things to watch out for. There are monsters that kills the player upon contact and there are UFOs that drop mines that also can kill the player. The UFOs themselves can however be taken out in the same way as the thieves. Once all thieves have been killed the game moves on to the next level which features more enemies. The player has three lives and when they are gone or all pods have been stolen the game is over. ",
