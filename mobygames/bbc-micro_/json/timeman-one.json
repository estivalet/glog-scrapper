  "description": "<i>Timeman One</i> is an educational game aimed at helping children tell the time.<br><br>The game screen consists of a clock to the right of which is a little man on a ladder. The game asks a series of questions which either require the player to state what time the clock is displaying or to move the hands of the clock to a specific time. If the player answers correctly the game displays a smiley face and the little man moves two steps up the ladder. If the answer is incorrect the little man moves down one step and the game displays a sad face but gives the player another chance at the question. If the second answer is incorrect the game shows the player the correctly answer before offering a new question. Each session is played until the little man reaches the top of the ladder when the game plays some happy music and the little man plants a flag and dances.<br><br>There are six games, <ul>\n<li>Three 'Telling the Time' games;<ul>\n<li>The Hours game in which the game sets the time at something o'clock and the player must respond to the question 'What time is it? __ o'clock' by entering the correct number\n<li>The Minutes game in which the game shows a clock with the minute hand only and the numbers 5 - 60 on the outside.
