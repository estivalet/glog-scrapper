  "description": "<i>Quiz Quest</i> is a trivia game with questions in five categories: pop, sport, general knowledge (easy and hard) and TV. In each category there are about 200 questions but included is also a program that allows the player to create new questions.<br><br>The game concept is based on the game Quiz Cards by Waddington Games. The player has to answer correctly a sequence of eight questions. For each question there are three alternatives to choose from. After all eight questions have been answered the player is given a report on the number of errors made and will then return to the first incorrectly answered question from where a new sequence begins. The game goes on until all the original eight questions have been answered correctly. The aim is to do so in the shortest possible time. ",
