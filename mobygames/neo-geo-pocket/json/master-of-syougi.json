  "description": "Syougi (usually transliterated as <i>sh?gi</i>) is &quot;Japanese chess&quot; - a turn-based board game (the board has 9x9 squares) very similar to normal chess, but all pieces are different. There we have: \n-1 king\n-1 rook\n-1 bishop\n-2 gold generals\n-2 silver generals\n-2 knights\n-2 lances\n-9 pawns.\nEach unit has own move and all units are weaker than chess counterparts (for example Knight/Horse can't go backward), but all figures can be promoted and gain new moves. The player must defeat the enemy's king. <i>Master of Syougi</i> is an electronic version of this classic board game, where players can choose fight characters to fight and change several rules.",
