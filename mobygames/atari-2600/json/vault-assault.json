You must push your joystick in the desired direction and press the button to fire. Ships will appear on the left side, right side, top or bottom of the screen. You must shoot them soon. If you wait, they will become mines launched at you that can lose you a life if they reach you. The higher the level, the quicker the mines are launched and the faster they move.",
