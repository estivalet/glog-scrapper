  "description": "Defend the earth from an alien mother ship with a sinister plot to cover the surface of the planet with ice.  Your weapon, a super heated laser able to melt the ice as it falls from the sky above.  Dodge snowballs by jumping over them as you blast the ice blocks.  If you get hit by a growing snowball, you'll have to sit it out for a little bit to gather your wits, while ice blocks continue to cover the landscape. In two-player games, which ever player is not the human will control the alien ship, dropping the ice.",
