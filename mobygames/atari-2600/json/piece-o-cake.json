  "description": "In <i>Piece o' Cake</i> you are a chef, and your goal is to successfully build cakes! <br><br>At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. <br><br>After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want, it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. <br><br>Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.",
