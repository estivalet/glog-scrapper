  "description": "<i>Surround</i> is an arcade action game for two players. Each player controls a constantly moving wall; the goal is to trap and force the opponent to crash into a wall. The player earns a point each time the opponent crashes. The first player to reach ten points wins. In addition to this mode, a video graffiti mode is also included which allows players to draw on the screen. Several game variations are included which optionally allow diagonal movement, allowing players to wrap around the screen and control the game speed.",
