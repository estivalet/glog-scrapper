So Atari went and altered <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/space-invaders________\">Space Invaders</a>. In this hack, the first five aliens are replaced by the letters P-E-P-S-I. The space ship that moves across the top has also been redesigned as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Pepsi\">Pepsi</a> red-white-and-blue circle logo. You have unlimited lives but only a three minute time limit to play. After the time runs out the game will flash with the words &quot;Coke wins&quot; at the top.",
