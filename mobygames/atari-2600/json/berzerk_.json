  "description": "This release of <i>Berzerk</i> is an alteration of the official <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Berzerk\">Atari 2600 version</a>. Some minor tweaks were done like altering the color and graphics to more closely resemble the arcade version but most notable was that the arcade game voices were added in, saying things like &quot;Intruder alert! Intruder alert!&quot; and &quot;Chicken, fight like a robot!&quot;.<br><br>The game play is the same. Eliminate robots on the screen. Do not touch them or the walls or you die. Do not let them shoot you. Do not linger in a maze or Evil Otto will come after you and he cannot be stopped so you would have to run.",
