  "description": "The object of <i>Actionauts</i> is to program your robot to perform a series of commands. Use the joystick to set the commands to make the robot walk through a path. On the Commodore 64, you can alter the grid to change the path, the programming is mainly done on the same page and you can select from four robot designs. On the Atari 2600, you select from preset mazes, the programming is on a second screen and you are trying to reach the 'cheese' goal.",
