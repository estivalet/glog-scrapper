  "description": "In this game, you are Bopper.<br><br>The object is to stun then capture Beanies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects.<br><br>If an unstunned Beany touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down.<br><br>You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beanies in a row without losing a Bopper.<br><br>There are two game options, one where the Beanies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.",
