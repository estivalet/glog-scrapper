  "description": "<i>Basic Math</i> is a math game for children.<br><br>Each game gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, then inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1-4 allow the player to select one of the numbers the player will be working with, while 5-8 give random questions.   <br><br>Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.",
