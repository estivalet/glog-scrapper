Years of constant assault\nfrom the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless.<br><br>Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy\nfreighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a\nfriendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with\nenough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet.</i><br><br>You are Earth's only hope.<br><br>Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.",
