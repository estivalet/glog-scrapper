  "description": "You want to steal your dream car. But first you must get those other clunkers out of the way.<br><br><i>Jammed</i> is a shifting-pieces puzzle similar to the board game Rush Hour where you are trying to move the white rectangles out of the way so the yellow car has a clear path to the exit. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white or yellow car and if it changes from a pink circle with a minus sign to a blue circle with an arrow, you can press the button to move the car. Try to free the yellow car in the fewest moves.",
