  "description": "A 4k game (three more than its predecessor!), Hunchy 2 boasts more bells and whistles (admittedly more bells than whistles) than the game it is nominally a successor to, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2005-minigame-multicart\">the Atari 2600's Hunchy</a>, and though superficially drawing thematic inspiration from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hunchback-ii-quasimodos-revenge\">Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge</a>, its basic gameplay has been more directly derived from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/chuckie-egg\">Chuckie Egg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/miner-2049er\">Miner 2049er</a>.<br><br>The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels \nof platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather bells while avoiding guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from the sides.",
