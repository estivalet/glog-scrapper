  "description": "This is regulation basketball with some exceptions. There are no three-point shots, no foul-line shots, no time outs, no penalties, no shot clock and neither the player nor the ball can go out of bounds.<br><br>You control two players in tandem. You pass balls between each other by pressing the button and pushing the joystick towards the other player. You shoot the same way but by pressing the joystick towards the basket. To steal the ball, just touch the opposing player who has the ball. Simply try to get more baskets than your opponents before the time runs out. Each game is divided into four quarters. After all four quarters are done, the game is over.",
