  "description": "Santa's reindeer have gotten lost and he must find them. The problem is that while he was an accomplished athlete at one time, 1943 state champion in 400m, in fact, and claims to be in perfect shape today, that shape is a sphere. He's not as young as he once was and doesn't have the stamina he once had.<br><br>You must get through four levels, each faster and trickier than the last. You must leap obstacles in levels in the North Pole, frozen tundra, the suburbs and the city. You must also gather items to keep up your energy. Some obstacles, such as elves, will help you and some, such as lightning in the city, will hinder you.",
