  "description": "It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the Trash Race.<br><br>Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his own grouchy way).<br><br>Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must select the one that corresponds to the number of items.<br><br>Both games one and two are one player only.<br><br>In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three races in game three, five in game four.<br><br>In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed.<br><br>Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points.<br><br>The trash items are:<br>\nbones<br>\nhangers<br>\ncoffee mugs<br>\ntoothbrush (presumably used)<br>\nold tin can<br>\nold televisions<br>\nold ten-gallon hats<br>\nold telephones<br>\nold tennis shoes<br>\nold dress shoes<br>\njunk mail<br>\nscissors<br>\nold toy boats<br>\nhammers<br>\nbeach balls<br><br>For ages three to seven.",
