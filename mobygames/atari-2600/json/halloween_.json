Players must guide the children to safe rooms while avoiding Michael Myers and his knife.<br><br>The house is large and full of dangerous blackouts and dead-ends within its sixteen rooms.  However, Laurie is not completely defenseless.  There is a knife that can be found to protect herself once the familiar theme music begins to play and killer remains in pursuit.  <br><br>Players will advance to the next level by either stabbing Michael Myers twice, or rescuing five of the children.",
