  "description": "<i>NASL Soccer</i> is an action soccer game for two players. The game follows typical soccer rules; attempt to score more goals than your opponent in the two 45 minute periods (this is in simulated time). You control one player on your team at a time while the computer takes control of the rest. The game allows you to dribble and pass, and features throw ins, corner kicks, goal kicks, and in the event of a tie the game goes in to overtime! Several skill levels are available which control the speed of the game. ",
