  "description": "<i>X-Man</i> is an adult arcade game that has nothing to do with the similarly-named <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=x-men\">Marvel comics franchise</a>. The player controls the titular X-Man, whose mind is focused on sex to the point of ignoring all danger. His objective is to make his way through a random maze, avoiding either crabs, scissors, or teeth, to get to the woman behind the door in the middle of the maze. The player has 90 seconds to get there.<br><br>Once the intrepid hero reaches his &quot;goal&quot;, the player enters a so-called &quot;Sexy Surprise&quot; mode, which is a simple sex simulation mini-game that lasts until the woman reaches orgasm. Clearly contradictory to most comparable real-life situations, the player has only 30 seconds to satisfy her;  then it is off to the next maze.<br><br>The player receives points equivalent to the amount of time remaining after X-man reaches the maze center. Points are also awarded for each increment of the sexual excitement meter. ",
