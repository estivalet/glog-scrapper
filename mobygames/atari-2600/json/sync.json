  "description": "<i>Sync</i> is a collection of rhythm and puzzle games.<br><br><b>Mantra</b>:<br>\nThe screen will show various symbols. Move the joystick to match the sequence until the sequence completes and you receive points.<br><br><b>Jitter</b>:<br>\nMuch like <i>Mantra</i>, you must match the sequence but now, each time you match a symbol, your control moves, automatically, to the next in the sequence.<br><br><b>Flow</b>:<br>\nYou have to place bars around those placed by the CPU. As soon as a counter completes a given number, every CPU cell whose number of bars corresponds to the sum of adjacent bars placed by the player is removed, and points are scored.<br><br><b>Four</b>:<br>\n<i>Four</i> has four mini-games. In <i>Gate</i>, you have to match symbols place by the CPU on a vertically scrolling column. In <i>Here</i>, you clear a cell whenever an arrow in inside each cell. Also in <i>Four</i> are <i>Jitter 1K</i> and <i>Flow 1K</i>, scaled down versions of their 4K cousins.",
