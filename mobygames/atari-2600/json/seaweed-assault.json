  "description": "<i>Seaweed Assault</i> is an underwater game where players use a semi-organic submarine to fight off overactive seaweed. Players can shoot bits of seaweed as they appear or let them build up for more points. The more bits of seaweed shot with one torpedo, the more each bit of seaweed is worth. Players have to decide whether they want to keep their sector clear or if they want to risk everything for more points.<br><br>Players must also avoid creatures called Wrothopods that swim down to feed and mature seaweed tentacles that reach up from the depths. A homing health canister is dropped each time players shoot 100 bits of seaweed. Corroded homing health canisters can sometimes be found trapped within the bits of seaweed. When a corroded homing health canister is released, players have a couple of seconds to recover it before its sensors activate and it tries to ram them.<br><br>The game has a pause feature and a setting for left-handed players who like to rotate the joystick clockwise (putting the fire button in the top right corner).\n ",
