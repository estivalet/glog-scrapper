  "description": "<i>Grand Prix</i> is a singleplayer action racing game. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack which scrolls horizontally. The goal is to reach the finish line in the shortest possible time on one of the four different tracks included. Of course, there will be obstacles on the tracks which will slow the player's car down if they're not careful. Numerous other cars will often get in the way, oil slicks will cause the player's car to temporarily lose control, and on the more difficulty tracks, narrow bridges will cause the player's car to come to a complete stop if they miss the path.
