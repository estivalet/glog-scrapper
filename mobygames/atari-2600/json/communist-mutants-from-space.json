  "description": "<i>Communist Mutants From Space</i> is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>. Your goal is to defend your home planet from the various mutant warriors which are attacking. You control an anti-mutant cannon on the bottom of the screen, and need to shoot as many of the mutants at the top as you can. At the very top of the screen a Mother Creature will be creating mutant eggs that fall into the formation. The eggs will slowly hatch into various creatures which fly down and try to bomb or crash into your cannon. If you destroy the Mother Creature as well as all of the mutants on the screen, you will move on to the next, more difficult level. Several game options are included which allow you to enable or disable a shield, guided fire, a time warp to temporarily slow down the game, and penetrating fire allowing you to take out several mutants with one shot.",
