  "description": "In <i>Skeet Shoot</i>, your goal is to earn as many points as you can by shooting clay pigeons. When you press the joystick button, your player will appear on the screen in one of several locations, and a clay pigeon will fire from the center. You need to shoot the clay pigeon before it disappears off the screen to earn a point. The game can be played by one or two players, and numerous game variations are included which control the level of difficulty, speed, and whether a player appears in a fixed or random location on the screen.",
