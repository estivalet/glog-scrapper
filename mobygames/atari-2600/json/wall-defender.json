You can only shoot in the direction on the wall side you are on.<br><br>The game ends when:<br>\n1. You are on a wall section or connecting bridge when it collapses, causing you to float away.<br>\n2. Your score reaches 999,999 points.<br><br>The aliens pictured at the bottom of the screen indicate what level you are on.
