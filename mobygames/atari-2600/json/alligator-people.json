  "description": "This game is based on a 1959 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Fox+Video+Games%2c+Inc%2e\">20th Century Fox</a> horror/sci-fi movie of the same name. You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.<br><br>You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.<br><br>Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.",
