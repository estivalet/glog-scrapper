  "description": "You are at the carnival, and are going to take a chance at the shooting gallery! Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various targets before you run out of bullets. In addition to the assorted targets that float by, there are boxes which can be shot to earn additional bullets. You also need to be careful of the ducks! From time to time, a duck will fly down and eat some of your bullets if you don't shoot it first. You move on to the next round of gameplay when the rack has been cleared of all the targets, and the game ends when you use up all of your bullets.",
