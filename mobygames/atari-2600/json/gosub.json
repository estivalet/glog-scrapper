  "description": "You are a submarine driver in search of sunken treasure off the coast of Cape Chammawingiwakauguflidplitargoknotz. Your job: Get the treasure chests and be rich! But there are dangers: it seems the treasures are well protected by walls and a pesky octopus. Go luck and be careful, Captain.<br><br>You pilot your sub through a maze, avoiding touching the deadly walls. Your goal is to reach the treasure chest at the end of the maze. Don't let the octopus completely cover your sub or you will die. Be aware that the octopus will slow you down so be prepared for a burst of speed once you are past.<br><br>The two player game, dubbed GoSub 500 by the creators, is a counter-clockwise race around an oval track. First to cross the finish line wins.",
