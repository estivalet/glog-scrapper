  "description": "The player is a treasure hunter exploring a maze. But the walls are shifting. The player might be trapped until they shift again. This would not be a problem except there is a wolf roaming the maze, trying to eat them.<br><br>There are twenty mazes (levels) to this game. In each maze, the player must collect ten treasures. Every few seconds, the walls shift, possibly trapping the treasure hunter until the walls shift again. The wolf, however, is not affected by the shifting walls. The player has a weapon to defend themself, along with their wits. In each maze, the player receives three decoys that they can place where ever the like. The wolf will always attack the decoys before resuming his hunt for the actual treasure hunter.<br><br>Can the treasure hunter collect the treasure or will the wolf huff and puff and snuff out his candle?",
