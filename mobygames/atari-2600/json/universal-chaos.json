  "description": "Take control of a tank in enemy territory.  As you navigate the columns and rows, you'll need to avoid crashing into enemy tanks while you blow them to smithereens.  Catch the bonus while on your hunt for some added points and a brief reprieve from the fast paced action.  The more tanks you take out, the more furious the enemy will be after you.  There are four difficulty levels and the option to have two players play competitively, each taking their turn.",
