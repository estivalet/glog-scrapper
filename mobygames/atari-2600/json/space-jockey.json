  "description": "<i>Space Jockey</i> is a side scrolling shooter for one player. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by having the player's attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, and weather balloons will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy the player's saucer.  There are even some trees and houses on the ground that can be shot for extra points. The player needs to make sure they avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of the player's three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of the player's saucer.",
