  "description": "In <i>Challenge</i>, players take control of a duck. The duck can only move vertically until it reaches the top or bottom of a column, then it can move left to get to the next column. The columns are intersected by rows. These rows contain creatures that continually go back and forth. Players have to go up and down between these columns while dodging the patrolling creatures. Successfully navigating all the columns in the six minute time limit completes a stage. Completing a stage earns an extra life on top of the six lives the player starts the game with and brings the player to the next stage which has increased difficulty due to more creatures being added.",
