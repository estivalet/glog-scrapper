  "description": "A downtown skyscraper has caught fire, numerous people are trapped, and you need to come to the rescue! Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations and difficulty levels are available.",
