  "description": "Hunt &amp; Score is similar to the game Memory. The player is presented with a numbered grid; behind each grid section is a picture. On each turn, the player chooses two grid sections in an attempt to find two matching pictures. Points are earned for finding matching pictures, and the player with the most points at the end wins. Several game options include a 16 or 30 square game grid, the ability to handicap one of the players, and the ability to enable or disable wild cards.",
