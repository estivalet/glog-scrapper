  "description": "This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in <a href=\"https://atariage.com/manual_page.html?SystemID=2600&SoftwareLabelID=1002&maxPages=16&currentPage=0\">this manual</a>.<br><br>Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:<br>\nAll pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.<br>\nNo piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.<br>\nA roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.<br>\nAfter moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.<br>\nIf, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.<br><br><b>Difficulty switches</b><br>\nRight:<br>\nA=computer rolls dice for you<br>\nB=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers<br>\nLeft:<br>\nA=computer sets up the board for you<br>\nB=you can set the pieces where you want them.<br><br><b>Game variations</b><br>\nGames 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player<br>\nGames 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player<br><br>Games one through four are backgammon<br>\nGames five through eight are acey deucey<br><br>Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.",
