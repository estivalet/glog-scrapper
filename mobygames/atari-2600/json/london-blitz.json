  "description": "During WWII, German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact, yet some would sit inactive for hours, days, or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a lance corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is the player's job to defuse these bombs.<br><br>First, the player will need to check the London map to see where the bombs are then start defusing them:\n<ul> \n<li>On the C64, the player may use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, the player may change it again and keep trying. <br><br><li>On the Atari 2600, the player may slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle controls the middle switch, and the bottom controls the right switch. The player may set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, which slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb; on blue bombs, the player cannot control the switches. They just randomly change and the player pushes right and hoping to disarm it in time.\n</ul>\nAt the start of the game, the player may select which rank to start at, from lance corporal to second lieutenant on the C64 or from lance corporal to first lieutenant on the Atari 2600. Every time the player disarms a bomb, the player move up levels within a rank. Move up eight levels and gain a promotion. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, the player is demoted a level in the rank. The possible ranks are (from lowest to highest): lance corporal, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant, warrant officer, lieutenant, first lieutenant, and captain.<br><br>The player loses the game if demoted below lance corporal or a bomb explodes while the player is near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen. The player wins if promoted to captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.",
