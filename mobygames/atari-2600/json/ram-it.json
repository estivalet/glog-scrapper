  "description": "The player takes on the role of the Ramroid, which is on a track in the center of the screen. The Ramroid can fire to the left and right. On both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. The player must shoot these bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets the player larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.<br><br>A round ends when one of the following occurs:<ol>\n<li>The player cleared all the colored bars from the screen.</li>\n<li>The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero.</li>\n<li>The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and the player cleared the rods where they still can.</li></ol>\nAfter three rounds, the game is over.",
