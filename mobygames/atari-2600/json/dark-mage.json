  "description": "Who knew? You thought you could play cards better than that when drunk. But now you've done it. You lost King Roland the Insane's black rose in a card game with the Dark Mage so you've been banished. The only way you can go home again is to find and return that black rose.<br><br>Use a joystick to take items, talk to characters and go places to find the king's rose.\nInspired by text-based games like those released by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Infocom\">Infocom</a>, you do not type here. Instead, you move the joystick to change the selection at the bottom of the screen then press the button to select.",
