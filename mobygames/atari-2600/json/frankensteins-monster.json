  "description": "In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation.<br><br>Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.<br><br>You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.<br><br>You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points.<br><br><b>Game variations</b><br>\nThe only variation is one or two players<br><br><b>Difficulty switches</b><br>\nLeft for player one, right for player two<br>\nSet to A for a five minute timer. Set to B for an eight-and-a-half minute timer.<br><br><b>Scoring</b><br>\nYou start with five hundred points.<br>\nIf you touch a ghost, tarantula or spider, you lose 20 points<br>\nIf you touch a bat, you lose 10 points<br>\nIf you fall through a trapdoor, you lose 100 points<br>\nIf you fall in the pool of acid, you lose 200 points as well as one life<br>\nEach stone you place gets you 500 points<br>\nIf you place all four stones, you get a 100 point bonus for each unit of time saved.",
