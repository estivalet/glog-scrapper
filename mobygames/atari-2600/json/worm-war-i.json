  "description": "Giant worms attack the city of Teriyaki, and it's the player's job to protect it. The player commands a tank at the bottom of the screen. The tank can move left or right while constantly moving forward. The player can control the forward speed by pushing up or down on the joystick.<br><br>As worms move back and forth, the player must shoot them so they don't touch the tank. Blocks on the tank's path must be destroyed as well. On the contrary, fuel pagodas should be spares, as they provide fuel to the tank. The tank can go to the far left or right of the screen and not get touched by a worm, but it is unable to shoot them when it is there, either.<br><br>In the two-player game, players can select between a co-operative and a competitive mode. In co-op mode, players share points and fuel: when one tank refuels, it refuels both. In competitive mode, each player has a separate score and fuel count, and the two players compete in shooting at enemies and getting to the fuel pagodas.",
