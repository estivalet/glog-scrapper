  "description": "In <i>Candy Catcher</i>, you must catch the falling pieces of candy in your Jack-o-Lantern bucket. Every piece you catch gains you 10 points. But, beware, as there is a robot that will traverse across the bottom of the screen. If he catches you, the game is over. Fortunately, you can jump onto him for 15 points. If the candy hits the ground, you lose a point, if it hits you, you lose 5 points and if the robots catches the candy, you lose 10 points.",
