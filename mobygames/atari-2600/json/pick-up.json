  "description": "OK, here's the deal. If you want that lover of your dreams to get off their pedestal and go out with you, you need to present them with the right gifts. Then you can head over to the Love Nest Hotel to really score!<br><br>You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose all your chances and the game is over. If you collect all the items needed, head over to the pedestal then head off the screen to the right. Head to the door of the hotel and the hotel sign will say how many times you have scored. Now head left to start the next level.",
