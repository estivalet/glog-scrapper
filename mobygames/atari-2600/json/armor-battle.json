  "description": "Armor Ambush (aka <i>Armor Battle</i>) is a two player game, where each player is in command of two tanks (one at a time), and they must try to destroy each other.<br><br>The battlefields constantly change, so no battle is ever the same.  Tanks move at average speed on grass, fast on roads, slow through trees, and slowest through water.<br><br>Tanks will explode after three direct hits.  The Harder game mode adds ricochet shots.",
