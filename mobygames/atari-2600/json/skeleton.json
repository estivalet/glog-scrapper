  "description": "<i>You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the \nmaze.  To your horror, you discover the source of the footsteps \nis a Skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly.  Acting quickly, \nyou blast it with your Undead Disintegrator and the Skeleton \nvanishes in a flash of colour.  But as you reload your UD, you \nhear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter or the \nhunted in this nightmare?</i><br><br>This game was inspired by the TRS-80 CoCo game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantom-slayer\">The Phantom Slayer</a>. In this title, you move through a maze, searching for skeletons. Find them before they find you. Once you encounter a skeleton, press a button to disintegrate it. There are ten skeletons per maze and eight mazes in total.",
