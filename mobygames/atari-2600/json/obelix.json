  "description": "A classic Asterix &amp; Obelix game where you simultaneously play as (both) Asterix and Obelix maintaining their favorite Gaulish sport of thumping the living daylights out of Roman soldiers.<br><br>The objective of the game is to help Asterix &quot;stun&quot; Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.<br><br>If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn &quot;red&quot; and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the &quot;red&quot; Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.<br><br>There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.",
