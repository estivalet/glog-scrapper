  "description": "In <i>Outlaw</i> the player controls a gunslinger in the Old West. It features both one and two player games. In the one player version, the goal is to shoot a moving target as many times as possible in 99 seconds. In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions.<br><br>In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for the player to hide from opponents shots. The player also has the choice of unlimited fire or only a six shooter. If the player chooses the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. Lastly, there is the getaway option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.",
