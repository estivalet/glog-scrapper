And I'm one tough cookie!</i><br><br>You, the Gingerbread Man, begin in an oven, where you must escape before being burned alive. Once you leave the oven, you must collect all the balloons in the dining room so you can float up through the chimney. Now that you on the roof, you must build a bridge to the nearby tree while fighting off cats and birds that think you look good enough to eat and are going to try. After you get to the tree, you must fight through the forest to reach a cave. Life just isn't easy. After you reach the cave, you must face your most fearsome enemy yet. If you defeat it, you are recaptured and returned to the over only it is now hotter.",
