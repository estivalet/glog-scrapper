  "description": "Chopper Command is a side scrolling shooter. As the pilot of a helicopter gunship, your mission is to protect the convoy of trucks which is travelling at the bottom of the screen. Each wave consists of numerous enemy choppers and jets which are trying to destroy you and the convoy. When all enemies in the current wave are destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult wave. To help out, a long range scanner is located at the bottom of the screen which can locate trucks in the convoy as well as enemy aircraft. Good luck, the ground troops are counting on you!<br><br>The game can be played by one or two players at either Cadet Level or Commander Level difficulty settings.  You start the game with 3 lives and can gain extra ones every 10,000 points, up to a maximum of 6 lives.",
