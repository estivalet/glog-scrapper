  "description": "Based on the unreleased Desert Bus mini game of Penn and Teller's Smoke and Mirrors, Desert Bus 2600 is a driving simulator where you drive a bus from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada.  Once in Las Vegas, you turn around and head back to Tucson.  Along the way you encounter the same cactus over and over again while the sun sets and a moon rises.<br><br>The bus cannot go more than 42 miles per hour and will occasionally drive into the sand and stall unless the driver constantly adjusts the steering.  An odometer shows the distance traveled and a helpful road sign indicates arrival at your destination.  Upon completing the journey to Las Vegas and back, you are presented with your final score.<br><br>A joystick controller is used to move the bus forward and to steer from left to right.  The action button honks the horn which has no effect on gameplay.",
