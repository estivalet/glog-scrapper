  "description": "In <i>L.E.M.</i> you are cast in the role of a Lunar Excursion Module commander about to land your craft on the Moon. Your objective is to safely land the L.E.M on the designated landing location without crashing the craft into the Moon’s surface or any asteroids that might be passing through the area. Landing the L.E.M. safely will initiate a new mission to land the craft at a new landing location. You get three crafts for each game and a bonus life is awarded after three and eight safe landings. Points are scored by landing the L.E.M. with as much fuel remaining on your fuel gauge as possible.",
