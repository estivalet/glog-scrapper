  "description": "This is a racquetball-like game that is best described as a 3D variation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/breakout_\">Breakout</a>.<br><br>You are at the end on a rectangular room. On the other end is a wall made of bricks or blocks. The ball travels down to the wall and knocks out a brick. It then returns to your end where you must use a squarish paddle to send the ball back to the wall. If the ball gets past the paddle, you lose a ball.<br><br>In the computer version, you must knock out all the bricks of the wall to advance. Each level has more bricks per wall. You begin with 5 balls.\nIn the console version, you must knock out 57 of the 72 bricks to advance. Each level has 72 bricks but the number of balls will lower in later levels. Level 1 starts with 99 balls.",
