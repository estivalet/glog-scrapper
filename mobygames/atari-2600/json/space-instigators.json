  "description": "This is an unauthorized conversion of the 1978 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Taito+Corporation\">Taito</a> coin-op game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/space-invaders________\">Space Invaders</a> for the Atari 2600. Unlike the authorized <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Midway+Games+West%2c+Inc%2e\">Atari</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/space-invaders________\">Space Invaders</a>, this version has all nine rows of invaders without flicker, rather than just six. Also, the sounds are closer to the arcade game. Gameplay is the same - shoot the rows of invaders and avoid their bullets, using your bases as shields and taking out the enemy mothership when it appears.",
