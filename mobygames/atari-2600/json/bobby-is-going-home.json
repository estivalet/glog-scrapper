  "description": "Players control Bobby as he tries to make his way home. Bobby has to jump over various obstacles laying in his path such as rocks, ponds, fountains, and broken bridges and also has to be careful not to collide with several animals that can get in his way such as hawks, chickens, butterflies, and bats. The game consists of seven screens of these obstacles with the eighth screen being obstacle free as it just involves simply walking Bobby forward into his house. Bobby starts with five lives on his journey home. He also starts with 3,000 points and will gain a 1,000 more for each screen he clears or for each time he loses a life. The score will constantly decrease so its ideal for the player to reach Bobby's house as fast as possible so they can rack up a high score.",
