  "description": "A solar storm has caused your space craft to crash. Unable to contact your base, you scout the area. There are apes everywhere. They are armed and hunting any humans they find. You must make your way to the last human stronghold without getting killed or captured and enslaved.<br><br>You begin in a forest and must make your way through it and over the river. Next you enter the village. You must make your way through and enter the desert. Through all this, you must shoot or avoid chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. Chimpanzees are harmless but orangutans can capture you and place you in a cage in the village and gorillas can capture you and/or shoot you. If you are captured, you must press your button to escape then head south to the desert. After the desert, you enter the poison caves. There are no apes here but you will lose a life point every second you are within. These caves are a maze you must get through but be advised that not all exits lead to the human stronghold. Some exits come out in the forest or desert. Once you reach the human stronghold, you will get a splash screen then your total points then you restart in the forest at a harder level.",
