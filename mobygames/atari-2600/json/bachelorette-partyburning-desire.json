You are hanging, naked, from a helicopter and must put the fires out by, it appears, spitting on them. You then lower your erected penis to the woman who holds on to it with her mouth while you fly her to safety. You must do this all while avoiding the rocks thrown at you. If you get hit by a rock or take to long and your girl gets roasted, you lose a life.",
