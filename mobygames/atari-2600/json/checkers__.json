  "description": "<i>Checkers</i> is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the same rules. <br><br>The object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponent's piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponent's piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes 'kinged' allowing movement both forwards and backwards. <br><br>The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.",
