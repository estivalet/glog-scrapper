  "description": "<i>Bermuda Triangle</i> is a side scrolling action game for one or two players. You are the pilot of a mini-sub exploring the waters in the Bermuda Triangle. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by collecting treasures and destroying the various enemies you'll encounter. Your mini-sub is equipped with a tractor beam which can be used to collect treasures found along the bottom of the ocean; when you successfully retrieve a treasure, you will then need to carry it safely up to the research vessel on the surface. Your mini-sub is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the many dangers you'll encounter, including giant squids, man-eating sharks, mines, bombs, enemy ships, and more. The game ends when all of your mini-subs have been destroyed, and there are multiple skill levels available.",
