  "description": "In Plaque Attack, your goal is to protect a mouthful of teeth from a variety of incoming foods! You control a tube of fluoride toothpaste, and you need to shoot the attacking foods before they can decay the teeth located at the top and bottom of the screen. Hamburgers, hot dogs, gum drops, strawberries, donuts, ice cream cones and more will all appear from the sides of the screen and make their way towards the teeth. If a food item reaches a tooth and is allowed to remain there for too long, the tooth will decay and disappear. The game ends when all of the teeth have decayed and disappeared. ",
