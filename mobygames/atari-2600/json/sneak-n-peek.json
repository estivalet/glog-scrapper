  "description": "<i>Sneak 'n Peek</i> is a computerized version of the game hide and seek. The game is played by two players (or one player against the computer); one player will close his eyes while the other player hides somewhere. After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.",
