  "description": "The player controls a space ship which travels through the galaxy. Unfortunately, there are asteroids and aliens which threaten the player's life...<br><br><i>Missile War</i> is a shooter and the only goal is surviving long enough in order to achieve a high-score. The player can move the space ship freely horizontally and vertically and shoot at the straight moving obstacles which enter the screen from the right side. Points are earned when obstacles are shot down and lost when they exit the left side of the screen. There are three obstacle types: asteroids, asteroids which divide into two smaller asteroids when shot and fast space ships. It is important to shoot down the enemy ships: if they are able to exit the screen, the player loses a life instead of just points. Because there are no enemy projectiles, the only other way to die is touching an obstacle. The background is plain-coloured.",
