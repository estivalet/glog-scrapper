  "description": "Mama Mia! That's a  lots a pasta!<br><br>Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table.<br><br>You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.<br><br>To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is <i>arrivederci una vita</i> (goodbye one life).<br><br>To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.<br>\n1=31<br>\n2=32<br>\n3=35<br>\n4=37<br>\n5=40<br>\n6=42<br>\n7=45<br>\n8=47<br>\n9=49<br><br>The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.<br>\nYou get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.",
