  "description": "<i>Birthday Mania</i> is a simple overhead shooter. Waves of candles come down from the top of the screen. Using the dial on a paddle controller, players move their character left and right and use the fire button to shoot them. Each wave features a set number of candles, and there are pauses between waves.<br><br><i>Birthday Mania</i>'s gimmick was its customizability. Players could order the game as a gift for another person; the developer would customize the title screen with the recipient's name and manufacture a custom copy for them. The manual and label also featured room for the recipient's name to be handwritten.",
