  "description": "Princess Rescue is a homebrew game for the Atari 2600 in 32K. It is essentially a re-imagining of the game Super Mario Bros as it could have looked on the Atari 2600 with what at the time would have been a very expensive cartridge. There are a full 16 levels and it plays very similar to the original Super Mario Bros on NES.",
