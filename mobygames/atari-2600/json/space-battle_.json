  "description": "<i>The intergalactic treaty of 2345 has been broken by a race known as the G'ohrn. You are on patrol in the Gamma Sector of the Dyni'bian Cluster when you receive a distress call from Earth outpost #4. Your mission is to defend the remote Earth outpost. </i><br><br>First you must guide your ship to a landing on the outpost's defense platform while avoiding an enemy sentry. After you have landed, you must fight off a wave of enemies. Be alert to your fuel level because if you run out, you will die. When you kill the enemies, some will drop fuel that you can get to replenish your supply. After you have destroyed the wave of ships, you must face two morphing Kh'rylian Destroyers. These do not drop fuel and take several hits to kill. After they are dead, the next wave begins.<br><br>Some variations to this game are:<ul>\n<li>The standard default play</li>\n<li>Laser fire that moves left or right after it is fired when your ship moves</li>\n<li>No shields</li>\n<li>Enemies that disappear and reappear</li></ul>",
