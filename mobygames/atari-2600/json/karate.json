  "description": "<i>Karate</i> is a fighting game for two players or one player against the computer. Your goal is to earn a black belt by winning a series of fights. By moving the joystick in various directions and pushing the button, you can use a variety of kicks and punches which are each worth varying amounts of points if successful. Each fight lasts for two minutes, and at the end of that time the points earned will be added up to determine who the winner is. There are two difficulty levels available.",
