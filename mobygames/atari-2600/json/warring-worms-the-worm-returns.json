  "description": "This is the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/warring-worms\">Warring Worms</a> with several improvements. <br><br>These include:<ul>\n<li><i>Tank Mode:</i> in this mode, you do not leave a trail behind you when you move.</li><br>\n<li><i>Solid Arena Mode:</i> the obstacles in the arena cannot be destroyed by your cannon, only worm trails or heads.</li><br>\n<li><i>Unbreakable Mode:</i> your cannon only hurts the opponent's head. Nothing else is affected by it.</li><br>\n<li><i>First To:</i> this allows you to set the ending score so game length will be manageable.</li><br>\n<li><i>Sudden Death Mode:</i> in this mode, if any player gets two points ahead of the other, they win.</li><br>\n<li><i>Select Game/Random Game:</i> selecting Random game changes most game options randomly before each round.</li></ul>",
