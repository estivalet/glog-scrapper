  "description": "<i>VGEvo Gorf</i> is a graphic hack of the Atari 2600 release of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/gorf\">Gorf</a>. Some of the enemy sprites have been altered to look like the graphics from the http://www.vgevo.com web site, others are Evil Otto-looking smileys. The game play is otherwise unchanged from the original <i>Gorf</i>.<br><br>As this is a commemorative edition celebrating Todd Rogers' world record high score on Gorf, the mother ship has the initials T. R. on it. The cartridge label is also signed by Todd Rogers.",
