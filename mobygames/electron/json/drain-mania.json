  "description": "<i>Drain Mania</i> is a variant of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mario-bros\">Mario Bros.</a> arcade game. The player takes control of a man called Theodore who is running around a system of sewers in an attempt to get out. The game contains a number of fixed screen platform levels where beasts named Inky, Pinky and Dinky appear from drainage pipes. To kill these the player first has to jump up and headbutt the floor tile they are moving over to knock them out and then reach and kick them while they are still toppled over. If the player takes too long time the beast will get back up and become more ferocious.<br><br>Each beast has a different strength, like Dinky who needs to be hit thrice before toppling over. At times water and fire balls appear from the pipes that have to be avoided. In addition to knocking the beasts, the player can earn points by collecting coins. Additionally there is a zap block that can be used to take out all enemies, but only three times, and there is an option to become invisible for a short time on each screen.",
