  "description": "<i>Hyper Viper</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Snake+variants\">Snake</a> game. The player controlled snake has to eat all the mushrooms that are found around the screen. As more mushrooms are eaten the snake grows longer. The screen is also full of rocks and these need to be avoided. Colliding with a rock, the walls or the snake's body leads to a lost life. Some mushrooms are flashing which means that they are about to be transformed into a rock. After eating a flashing mushroom the snake is able to eat one rock. Once all mushrooms have been eaten the player moves on to the next level. Later levels have more advanced layout with more walls to collide with. There are five levels in total.",
