  "description": "<i>Bird Strike</i> can be described as a 'Musical Shoot 'em up' where the objective is to finish a tune, by filling up a sheet of music on the top of the screen. Planes swoop down from the sky to drop bombs on your gun emplacement, while you return fire. Planes can be destroyed by a direct  fuselage hit, while the only way to finish a level is to hit the wings of the plane releasing a pigeon flying across the screen that has to be shot to obtain a note for the tune. Once a tune is completed, another, more difficult level starts.",
