  "description": "<i>Crazy Tracer</i> is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Amidar\">Amidar</a>. The player controls a paint brush and needs to paint levels divided into rectangles of various sizes. They are painted by moving over the bordering edges, colouring them. When a rectangle is traced entirely, it is filled with a colour. Meanwhile enemies that roam the edges need to be avoided. Sometimes fruit appears in the middle of a rectangle for a short moment. When the rectangle is painted while the fruit is still inside, additional points are earned. The character has a number of lives and the game keeps tracks of the score.",
