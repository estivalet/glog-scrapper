  "description": "This was the first in Lothlorien's Warmaster series of Strategy wargames and re-creates the epic battle in 1815 when Napoleon met his final defeat at the hands of a combined British, Dutch and Prussian army at Waterloo.<br><br>In the game, you command Napoleon's forces against the combined Anglo-Dutch army of Wellington (controlled by the computer). The computer also controls the Prussian forces, which arrive at a later phase of the game. Your objective is to rout the Anglo-Dutch army at Waterloo, while leaving enough men to deal with the Prussian threat coming from Ligny. <br><br>Infantry and cavalry units are available for both sides (no artillery), each with varying degrees of strength and morale. Terrain effects play an important role in the effectiveness of units - the Anglo-Dutch forces, for example, occupy ridges and farmhouses which increase their defensive capabilities.",
