  "description": "<i>Felicity Farm Girl</i> is an educational game that teaches basic mathematics for young children. It's similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pirate-pedro\">Pirate Pedro</a> from the same author but deals with division instead of addition and subtraction. The player has to answer ten division problems given by Daniel Duck. The task is to help Felicity share out bags of oats to her hungry horses. For each question the player enters how many bags each horse should get and if there is a remainder that too needs to be entered. If answering wrong an animation will show Felicity give out the correct amount of oats to the horses.",
