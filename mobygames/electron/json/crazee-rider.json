  "description": "<i>Crazee Rider</i> is the spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Superior+Software\">Superior Software's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bbc-micro_/overdrive_\">Overdrive</a>. Originally envisioned as a car racing game it was turned into a motorcycle racer during development. Players need to race opponents over different tracks, starting out at the 60th position. To progress the player has to end in the top six of the pack in a single lap. Compared to <i>Overdrive</i> there are more opportunities to avoid opponents and tracks also have bends. Two keys are used to speed up or down and two others to steer. For bonus points it is possible to bump into the sides of other opponents. This does not slow them down, it only provides points. Driving straight into them from the back slows down the player's motorcycle significantly. This also happens when the curb is hit while taking corners at a high speed. A mini-map of the track is shown near the top of the screen, along with the score. The current position and the speed is shown at the bottom.<br><br>The BBC Micro release contains a standard and an enhanced version. The enhanced version uses different colours, has more variety in the clothing of opponents, and contains a music track.",
