  "description": "<i>Goal!</i> is a simple football game with a perspective similar to Commodore's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=International+Soccer\">International Soccer</a> although without scrolling. It only features single matches between two unnamed teams, one with red kits, the other in white. The game is for a single player only and the only option before starting out is the division of the computer controlled team: division 1 or 2? Division 2 is the beginner's level with the difficulty at a minimum throughout the game. When choosing Division 1 the computer will play at various levels of skill depending on the standing in the match.<br><br>The game can be only be controlled with the keyboard and in addition to four movement keys all actions are made with the return key. When in position of the ball it is used to kick it and when not it's used to select the footballer that is closest to the ball. When the opponent shoots it is also used to make a save attempt by the goalkeeper.",
