  "description": "You play Agent Starman, your job is to avoid the destruction of civilization and taking over the galaxy by the bug-eyed Xabanneus alien hordes. Then penetrate the ten levels of the Mother ship and destroy the power generator. He carries on its back an oxygen supply (represented by the energy bar on top) and an alien repulsion mechanism that will sometimes activate in times of danger.\nAnother game following the success of Manic Miner. The game is quite simple, move thru each level until reaching level 10, avoiding all the bug eyed aliens, negotiating bridges and moving platforms. You only use 2 keys - left and right - to control the main character, so most of the gameplay revolves around timing and practice.",
