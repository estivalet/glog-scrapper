  "description": "<i>Overdrive</i> is a racing game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pole-position\">Pole Position</a> but only with straight tracks, without bends. The five tracks have different scenes such as fields, night, snow, desert and riverside. Starting at the end the player needs to finish among the top of the racing pack to progress. This is visualized through a bar at the top of the screen. For every car that is overtaken, the indicator moves to the right. The player needs to reach the blue part of the bar to move on. At the end bonus points are awarded for every car that was passed.<br><br>The car can be moved into five areas of the track. Two keys are used to accelerate or slow down. Racing at a high speed is required to finish in the top in time, but that also makes it more difficult not to crash into the other cars. When destroyed the game can be immediately continued, but the speed needs to be built up again. Opponents can also crash into the back of the player's car when the speed is too slow. The progress is not saved, so when a course is not finished in time it needs to be started from the first stage again.",
