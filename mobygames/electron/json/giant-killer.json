  "description": "This edutainment title takes on the familiar interactive fiction/adventure format, with a text parser-driven interface similar to other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Topologika\">Topologika</a> releases, and adds a twist in the form of mathematical/logic puzzles used to drive the story.  Aimed at the ages of 10 and above, the game takes its basic plot from the folk tale of <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>.  You take on the role of Jack (if a boy) or Jackie (if a girl), sent to the market with explicit orders from Mum to buy a pig.<br><br>If you play your cards right, you can obtain a magic bean, plant it, and ascend the resulting beanstalk for yet more adventures and conundrums.  The numerous brain-teasers include numerical puzzles, exercises in spatial orientation, geometric pattern recognition and map navigation; several are randomized and require a fresh solution each time you play.  There are points to be earned and treasures to find - hopefully worth somewhat more than the porker you were sent out to get.",
