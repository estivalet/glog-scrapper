  "description": "<i>Fantasia Diamond</i> is a traditional text adventure with static graphics, where the titular diamond, a family heirloom has been stolen and has to be retrieved from a sinister riverside fortress. Along the way, Boris the Masterspy is to be rescued who was imprisoned during a previous attempt to recover the diamond. On the way you encounter elves, pixies, gnomes and an decidedly unfriendly woodcutter. In order to gain strength, you need to eat and drink and your strength determines how many objects you can carry. There is a real-time element to the game where every character takes an action every 15 seconds or so, without regard to your actions.\nThe interface is text driven with split screen graphics. The text parser can use relatively complex sentences for the time.\n",
