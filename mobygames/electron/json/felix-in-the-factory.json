  "description": "Players control Felix, a factory worker who must ensure that his generator does not run out of oil. The oil can be found somewhere within the factory. But before he can reach it, Felix must first cross by jumping over parcels that move the conveyor belt. If he touches any of the parcels, he falls down and is carried along the belt until he reaches the end. If he has time to stand up, he can continue on as normal but if he reaches the end of the belt, he loses a life.<br><br>Then, Felix has to navigate a series of platforms which are populated by enemy gremlins. Felix has to overcome these gremlins by getting out of their way or using a pitchfork to destroy them. Occasionally, a giant rat runs across the screen, and Felix can deal with it by laying down some rat poison. If he comes into contact with either a gremlin or the rat, Felix falls off the platform and loses a life.<br><br>Once the oil is collected, Felix must return to the generator so that it can be refilled. If the generator runs out of oil, the game ends regardless of how many lives the player has.\n",
