  "description": "<i>UK PM</i> is a political simulation game where the player gets to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and run the country. After selecting a name and one of four parties (Conservative, Labour, S.D.P. and Liberal) the player is presented with several pages of text that shows information about the country's taxes, spending, prices, social benefits etc. The player can then edit these numbers, for example raise the product tax on petrol or spend more money or health services, before progressing. The year will then be played out with graphs showing inflation, popularity and unemployment while messages show if funds are not sufficient in an area. At the start of every new year the player can make further changes.",
