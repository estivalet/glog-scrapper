  "description": "<i>Repton Thru Time</i> is the final of three standalone expansion packs for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Repton+3\">Repton 3</a>. It includes 40 new levels made in the map editor that was included with the original game. This time Repton is travelling through time and visits a number of historical places. There are five sets of levels each with eight levels. Each set represents an age or historical place and are as follows:\n<ul><li>Prehistoric times</li>\n <li>Ancient Egypt</li>\n <li>Victorian times</li>\n <li>Now</li>\n <li>Future</li></ul>\nThe gameplay is the same as in Repton 3 but all objects have been replaced with objects related to the setting. Instead of diamonds, there are for example berries in the prehistoric levels and papyrus scrolls in the Egyptian levels. Boulders have been replaced by garbage cans in the modern day levels and urns in the Egyptian levels and so on. In the same way each level has different enemies, for example policemen in the Victorian levels and aliens in the futuristic levels. The appearance of Repton also differs from level to level with outfits typical of the times. ",
