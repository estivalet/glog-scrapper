  "description": "Number 11 and final entry in the Mysterious Adventures series. You've spent a fun day at the local fair.  Now you decide to head over to the waxworks for some fun.  But you are tired.  You lie down for a snooze...<br><br>It turns out you are trapped in the Waxworks.  Is it all a dream though?
