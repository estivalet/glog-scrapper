  "description": "<i>Wet Zone</i> is a modified port of the shoot 'em up game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Arcadia\">Arcadia</a> which initially was an official conversion but which after Imagine's demise was released by third party publishers. The gameplay is identical to the original game and it contains twelve waves of different types of aliens that have to be shoot down. The sprites used for the aliens and their movement patterns are not identical though and as might be expected from the title they follow an aquatic theme. Among the enemies that will appear there are submarines, water beetles, umbrellas and several others. Any contact with an enemy or their projectiles leads to one out of five lives being lost.",
