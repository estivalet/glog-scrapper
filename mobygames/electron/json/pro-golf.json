  "description": "Sunningdale and Pebble Beach golf courses are provided in this strategic golf game. Up to four players can take part in single round, tournament (featuring 18 players over four rounds), or practice modes.<br><br>The game is viewed from overhead, with the entire hole on a single screen. The player must choose a club, then a shot power, and then a shot direction, before executing the planned shot by pressing space once to start the swing, and again to execute it – imprecise timing can impart draw or fade onto the shot. On the green you must choose the shot power before the direction, taking an overall slope into account. There is no indication as to how far the ball is from the hole.",
