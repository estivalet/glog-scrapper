  "description": "You are the rightful heir to the throne of Hamil - stolen away as a young child, you had grown up unaware of your birthright.  To you, the kingdom of Hamil was known only through myths and rumors: a place of magic and grandeur, steeped in legends of majestic castles and wondrous antiquities; but also fraught with danger, as creatures and powers of the dark side have taken a particular shine to it.  Finally learning the secret of your identity, you decide to ride out to Hamil and stake your claim.<br><br>However, there are hidden powers who would like very much to have Hamil for themselves, and they don't think too highly of your endeavor.  As soon as you set out they follow in hot pursuit, and finally force you to take refuge in a small run-down chapel at the edge of the kingdom.  Here the adventure begins, as your first task is to find a way out of your makeshift sanctuary without snuffing it rather quickly.",
