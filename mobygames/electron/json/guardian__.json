  "description": "In this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/defender\">Defender</a> clone, you are a spaceship that must protect humanoids on the mountainous terrain from approaching aliens. To help you, you are equipped with two weapons. The rapid fire laser is used to destroy any aliens in sight, while the limited supply of smart bombs vaporize alien life on screen. Extra smart bombs are awarded every 10,000 points. Hyperspace can also be used to warp from one part of the planet to another, in the hope of rescuing the humanoids faster. <br><br>When Landers, one of the enemies, get close to the nearest humanoid, the Landers will pick them up and make their way to the top of the screen. If you do not shoot the Landers before they reach the status bar, both them, plus the captured humanoid, will explode. If you manage to shoot the Lander, the humanoid is released and it is your job to maneuver the ship under them so they can be taken back to the terrain. If you don't do this, then the humanoid will explode once they reach the terrain. <br><br>A scanner, found at the top of the screen, shows the location of your ship, enemies, and humanoids. This scanner is very useful in keeping track of enemies that are approaching you from behind, as well as locating the enemies that have captured humanoids. Once you have killed all enemies in the level, the next level begins. Bonus points are awarded for each humanoid saved.",
