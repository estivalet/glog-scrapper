  "description": "<i>To Hell in a Hamper</i> is a comedic interactive fiction game, originally created in the ADRIFT engine for the Adrift Spring Competition 2003. It is entirely set in one location. <br><br>The protagonist is professor Pettibone, a Victorian balloonist on a journey around the world, whose balloon is currently unstoppably drifting towards the mouth of an Andean volcano. The balloon must be raised to a safe altitude, but sadly, your companion Hubert Booby absolutely refuses to part with the assortment of weighty mementos stashed within his cavernous overcoat. With time mercilessly ticking away, you must uncover and get rid of Booby's ridiculous collection, even as each item proves more troublesome than the last. ",
