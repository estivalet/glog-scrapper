  "description": "The planet Zenon is so dangerous that only the most heroic space adventurers would dare to land there. It's full of more evil creatures than anyone can possibly have a chance against. But the player's objective is to do just that. He has to make his way through 250 levels and reach the heart of Zenon.<br><br><i>Zenon</i> is a side scrolling shoot 'em up. The player is beamed down on the left and has to make his way through each of the game's levels (which are about ten time the length of the screen) while shooting or avoiding the various monsters and strange objects that come in his path. To his help he has a jetpack that allows him to gain some height. When starting out the player has a simple laser gun but by picking up power ups better weapons such as a twin shot laser or a atomic blaster are made available. Monsters that the player will come across include the snake-like terrapedes, the giant steel eyes called orbitoids and the walking machines called roamodrons. There are also various strangely shaped objects that bounces around in the air. Making contact with any of the nasties leads to a reduction of energy until all energy is lost and the player loses one of his four lives. Energy automatically recharges if the player avoids the nasties long enough or when a energy cell is picked up.<br><br>In addition to the singleplayer mode there is also a two player mode where players battle the creatures simultaneously.
