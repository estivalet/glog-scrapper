  "description": "You are Hank and to gain access to the main Central Computer Games Library you have developed a sprite called 'The Hacker' which you plan to use to get through your terminal and modem, the telephone network and further microscopic circuits till it reaches the main file store. The game has 12 levels and each level is viewed from the side as a single screen platform game. You start at the bottom left and you must get to the top right walking on platforms, jumping gaps and avoiding the baddies protecting each circuit. On the way you have to collect five white disks before escaping to the next level.  Each level has a timer shown as your power and you must get to the end of each level before it reaches zero. You receive a bonus score for any power left.",
