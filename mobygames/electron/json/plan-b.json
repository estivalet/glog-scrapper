  "description": "<i>Plan A, to bomb the rogue central computer has failed. The next step is Plan B...</i><br><br>You control a war drone teleported inside the computer complex and must find and destroy all the computer parts and then escape, while constantly fighting off the security robots. Extra rockets can be picked up and oil cans and spanners will replenish your energy, but be careful not to shoot these before picking them up. Some parts of the scenery can be shot to allow passage, to destroy computer parts or gain access to items, although it may not be immediately obvious which sections can be destroyed. Ten keys need to be found to open the front door in addition to other keys which can be used to gain access to the other areas.<br><br>The graphics in <i>Plan B</i> are black and white.",
