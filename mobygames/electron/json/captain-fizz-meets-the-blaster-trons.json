  "description": "The Blaster-Trons have invaded the planet Icarus, which is set as 20 levels on top of the last. The people can only be saved if a hero or two step forward and reach each of the 20 lifts in this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>-style game. Two players is the ideal, as gameplay is simultaneous and only ever fills half the screen for each player. Each level has doors which are locked with colour coded keys, as well as doors which can only be used in one direction, and lots of long corridors and mazy layouts. Both yourself and the aliens are armed with lethal lazers, although you can take several hits before dying.",
