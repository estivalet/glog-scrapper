  "description": "In <i>Anarchy Zone</i> the player controls a space ship on a fixed screen (called Anarchy Zone) to shoot the enemies, such as solid balls, fuzzy balls, eyeballs, peace symbols, TV sets, shockers, and toilets. It is possible to move the space ship left or right, but it is rotated 360 degrees around the entire screen. Behavior of the enemies varies. Some of them fly in the center of the screen, some are placed in the corners, and some tries to collide with the player's ship. Enemies shoot bombs that need to be avoided, because each hit decreases the space ship's power. To gain the skill bonus in a zone all enemies on the screen need to be eliminated in a certain amount of time. There are 33 zones in the game. Each of them may is accessed with a four-digit code. High scores of the best anarchists are stored in a Top 8 table.",
