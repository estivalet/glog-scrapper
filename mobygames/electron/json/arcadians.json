  "description": "<i>Arcadians</i> is based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/galaxian\">Galaxian</a> where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, blasting aliens above moving in formation. As you blast the aliens, some will swoop down in groups dropping bombs trying to kill you and they can be avoided or shot. If you are touched by an alien or it's bombs then you lose one of three lives and once the aliens have all been destroyed then you attempt to destroy them again. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns when the other play loses a life.",
