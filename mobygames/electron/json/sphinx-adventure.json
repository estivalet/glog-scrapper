  "description": "<i>Sphinx Adventure</i> is an text adventure game where the player's aim is to collect as much treasure as possible and bring it to the Sphinx. The game is played with the typical verb noun commands: GO WEST, LOOK, TAKE KEY etc. The player starts out in a forest and can explore the country side in search for items needed to enter the valley of doom. Once inside the halls of spirit it will be very dark and the player risks falling into a pit. Therefore finding a source of light might be necessary. At times the player might come across various fantasy creatures such as dwarfs, ogres and dragons that attack the player. These can be fought, either with bare hands or with some of the weapons that can be found throughout the game world. There is also magic involved and at times a wand has to be used. The game ends if the player is killed and a score is then given based on how much treasure has been found.",
