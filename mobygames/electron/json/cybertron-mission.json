  "description": "<i>Cybertron Mission</i> is a top down game in which the player explores a maze of rooms to find various randomly placed items. Once found, touching a safe ends the level and starts the next level. Movement and firing are eight-directional. Touching a wall results in instant death by electrocution. Enemies generate in random positions when a room is entered. Linger in a room for too long, and &quot;Spook&quot; appears, a fast-moving creature that passes through walls, but can be temporarily stunned with shots.<br><br>Each level is a maze of 4x4 rooms. In the first level, one item is needed and the player faces only slow moving &quot;Spinners&quot;. In the second level, two items are needed and unpredictable &quot;Clones&quot; are added, that shoot back. In the third level, three items are needed, and the &quot;Cyber-droid&quot; is introduced. The player starts with five lives, and is awarded an extra life at regular score intervals, on reaching a new level, and on collecting a potion.<br><br>",
