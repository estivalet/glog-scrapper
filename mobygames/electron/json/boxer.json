  "description": "You control the character of a boxer. Your task is to run around a gymnasium (not a boxing ring) competing against the computer controlled opponent for the affections of the lovely lady at the bottom of the screen.\nShe releases helium filled balloons which float upwards and get caught in the rafters of the platforms. You must collect (or burst) five balloons by headbutting them, to progress to the next level.\nAfter a short time in the rafters, the balloons will free themselves and float to the top of the screen. These are then lost and awarded to your opponent.\nYour opponent doesn't just sit around doing nothing while all this is happening. No. He runs around trying to drop weights on you from above. There are also Boxing gloves, hammers and dumb-bells flying around to either avoid or punch.",
