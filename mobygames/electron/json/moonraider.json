You command a highly manoeuvrable assault ship equipped with a rapid-fire laser cannon plus a limitless supply of Tyrex bombs. Keep an eyes on your fuel level which is constantly decreasing. This can be replenished by blowing up the enemy fuel dumps.<br><br>Points are scored for destroying the radar scanners, rockets, ack-ack batteries and bouncing space-mines.<br><br>The mission, i.e. the level of difficulty, can be selected by pressing keys A to D. Also, you can jump to any stage in a mission by pressing keys 1 to 5.",
