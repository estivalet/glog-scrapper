  "description": "This double-pack from Topologika concludes <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,39740/\">Peter Killworth</a>'s Doom trilogy with <em>Last Days of Doom</em>, another futuristic exploration adventure set on the treacherous world of Doomawangara.  This time around the planet Doom appears to be, well, doomed: tectonic activity, eruptions, instabilities throughout the star system, and reports of another mysterious artifact turning up.  Despite your previous nightmarish experiences on the planet, you somehow feel obligated to investigate.  Hurrying to arrive before the planet's imminent doom, you make planetfall, now accompanied by a team of three: your second in command, an engineer and a navigator - plus the four-legged robotic friend you acquired in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/return-to-doom\">the previous game</a>.<br><br>Also included is <em>Hezarin</em>, an older title from the mainframe days reworked and expanded for newer systems.  Here the Adventurer's Guild sends you to the world of Hezarin, in response to its peasants' cries of help: the sorcerer Anjith holds the fantastical land and its inhabitants in an iron grip.  Your task is to explore the exotic world and try to locate the rumored magical artifact that could vanquish the oppressor (which is, of course, missing in action).",
