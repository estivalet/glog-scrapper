  "description": "<i>Impact</i> is an old break-out style game. The user controls a paddle and needs to catch a ball with the paddle each time it comes down. When the ball hits a brick, it is destroyed (unless it's made undestroyable). Sometimes, a bonus will come out of the brick. This adds to the 'bonus score'. When the player collected one or more bonuses, he may 'release' them, and he receives a powerup. Each 'bonus score' has a different powerup: the most powerful powerups need the largest number of bonus points. Impact comes with a lot of levels and a level editor.",
