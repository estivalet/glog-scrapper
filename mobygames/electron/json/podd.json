  "description": "<i>Podd</i> is an educational game where the player can type in various words and the eponymous character (a red ball-like creature with legs) will act them out. Podd knows about 120 words, all verbs, and the aim of the game is to find them all. After one has been entered a brief animation is shown of Podd doing the action. Although 120 words are recognised, some of the words have the same animations. There are two games modes. In the first one the player enters one word at a time while in the second sequences of two to five words are entered.",
