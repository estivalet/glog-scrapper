  "description": "<i>Johnny Reb</i> is a turn-based strategy game for one or two players, based on the American Civil War. Players can control an army of either the Union or the Confederation.<br><br>There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry and artillery, and it's possible to decide how many of each type the player's army should consist of. After the initial set-up, the battlefield is generated. The goal is to capture the enemy's flag, but it's also possible to achieve a victory by points. Army control is handled with the keyboard - units can move in eight directions. Artillery can shoot over distance, the other unit types can directly attack by simply moving to an adjacent square.",
