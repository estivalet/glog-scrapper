  "description": "One of the several video games based on Ryo Mizuno's fantasy novels, this version of <i>Record of Lodoss War</i> does not follow the main plot of the novels, but is instead dedicated to an important episode from the history of Lodoss: the battle of Six Heroes against the demon god. <br><br>The introduction shows the Six Heroes in the middle of this confrontation. Flaus, the priestess of Valis, is slain in battle. The hero Beld, enraged, invokes a demonic power to defeat the god. But when the battle is over, the heroes disappear...<br><br>The game begins with Karla the Grey Witch, one of the Six Heroes, alone in a strange place, her powers lost. After completing Karla's scenario, the player is taken to the scenarios of the other heroes, and finally finds out what happened to all of them.<br><br><i>Record of Lodoss War</i> is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down navigation, world map, and randomly appearing enemies. However, the battles have a strategic edge, allowing the characters to move on the battle field freely. The battles take place on an isometric screen. Characters can also acquire unique abilities, such as for example Karla's ability to possess bodies of other people.",
