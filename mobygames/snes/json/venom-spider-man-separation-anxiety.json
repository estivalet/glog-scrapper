  "description": "<i>Separation Anxiety</i> is a 2D side-scrolling platform-action beat 'em up game featuring several prominent characters from the Marvel Universe and gripping storylines taken from the popular Spider-Man comics. The game is based loosely on a mini-series of comics about the Venom saga. In this game, 1-2 players can select and take control of Spider-Man and/or his on-and-off again arch-nemesis Venom. As Spider-Man and/or Venom, you must set off and stop the life foundation that has spawned out 5 symbiote offsprings from Venom and plans to bond them together with its soldiers in order to assemble and form a vast deadly army. As Venom recovers from his wounds, he thus realizes and decides that he must set out and fight them off either alone or with the aid of his old arch-nemesis Spider-Man.<br><br>The game allows you to punch, kick and swing your way as well as execute combos throughout the streets, the woods and even through the underground complexes towards accomplishing your main goal. Along the way, the player(s) can also find and pick up some helpful superhero ally icons that allow you to summon a few of Spidey's greatest allies to your aid including Captain America, Hawk-Eye, Ghost Rider and Dare Devil. <br><br>",
