  "description": "At a secret lab developing technology in interdimensional physics, some kind of accident has occurred. Suddenly all contact is lost with the facility and the power shut down. The dimensional fabric surrounding the facility seems weak and strange monsters have been sighted. Concerned, an unknown agency preps a cybernetic soldier and his weapons to investigate...<br><br>Playing as the bionic soldier, this game is a top-down shooter. The player must blast their way through enemy forces and the activate various switches to progress. Accessing computer memory banks throughout the facility will reveal footage of the accident and give some idea of all it happened. Additionally, dimensional holes have opened up all around the levels allowing monsters to appear and making certain paths, walls and technologies inaccessible until the area has been stabilized.<br><br>The soldier uses a main weapon and a secondary weapon to progress, both of which can be cycled at any time and upgraded to new weapons found in the area.",
