You must line-up blocks  of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as &quot;attacks&quot; in hopes of causing him/her to lose.",
