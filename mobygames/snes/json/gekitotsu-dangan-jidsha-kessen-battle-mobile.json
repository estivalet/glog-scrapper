  "description": "One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.<br><br><i>Gekitotsu Dangan Jid?sha Kessen: Battle Mobile</i> plays similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/spy-hunter\">Spy Hunter</a> in both perspective and objective, but your car in <i>Battle Mobile</i> isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.",
