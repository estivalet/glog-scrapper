The games all use the same game engine as Jupiter's previous picross title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Mario%27s+Super+Picross\">Mario's Super Picross</a>, but each feature less puzzles and omits the hieroglyph/archeology theme for a more basic pen and paper style in its place.<br><br>The unique character set for Vol. 8 is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Donkey+Kong+Country\">Donkey Kong Country</a> for the SNES.",
