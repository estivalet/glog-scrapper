  "description": "Everybody's favorite dog, Snoopy, is having a concert today! And all his human friends are invited. But there's one problem - not everybody is prepared! They have to either get their stuff together, or go someplace to buy something for the show, or so on... Will Snoopy be able to solve this logistical nightmare and get everybody ready for the big concert?<br><br><i>Snoopy Concert</i> has a single player controlling Snoopy with the Super NES Mouse going around town doing good deeds for his friends from the comic strip <i>Peanuts</i>. Each of the four characters not ready for the concert have their own little problems: Rerun has to get to the theater while avoiding obstacles in his stroller's way, Linus must pick a flower for Lydia, Schroeder must find his music, and Charlie Brown is missing his baseball gear and needs it in time for the season opener. To resolve them, Snoopy must perform various tasks using the mouse, like do a little detective work, or win a race, or direct a character to the right place. Once everything is set for the character, their sub-game is cleared and they will be seated for Snoopy's concert.<br><br>Each of the four characters' sub-games can be selected in any order. The game is finished when everybody is seated in the theater for the concert.",
