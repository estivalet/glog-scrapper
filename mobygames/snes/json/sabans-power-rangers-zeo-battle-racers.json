  "description": "In this racing title based in the Zeo season of world-famous television series <i>Power Rangers</i>, players are allowed to select among the six Zeo Rangers (Pink, Yellow, Red, Blue, Green, Gold) or their enemies (King Mondo, Cog Soldier) to compete in a head-to-head circuit challenge along 16 race courses divided by 5 Tracks.<br><br>Each pilot has different attribute levels for Acceleration, Speed and Grip, providing a more balanced competition. Besides several obstacles and speed energizers scattered by the courses, players can attack opponents by firing Blasters (a la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-kart\">Super Mario Kart</a> special items) at their adversaries; the limit is 5 Blasters per race except for Cog Soldier's infinite Blaster amount.<br><br>Along with 1-Player game modes (Race, Time Trial and VS CPU), the game also offers 2-Player split-screen gameplay through Race and 2P VS plus 3 alternative modalities: <b>Point Race</b>, where players must race over objects to earn points; <b>Bumper Chase</b>, with the main objective to ram the opponent off the course; and <b>Blaster Master</b>, a Life Energy-based deathmatch.",
