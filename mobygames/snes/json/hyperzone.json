  "description": "A 3D shooter similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/space-harrier\">Space Harrier</a>. Control different futuristic flying vehicles and blast your way through numerous enemies and obstacles. If your ship is getting too fast, you can use the brakes, however flying too slow damages your ship. Apart from the standard weapons, most ships have a special attack that can be charged by holding down the fire button. The action takes place on set tracks; leaving those tacks will cause heavy damage to your ship. You can repair your ship by flying over certain areas. At the end of end of each level, a boss has to be defeated.",
