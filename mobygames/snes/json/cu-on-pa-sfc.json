  "description": "<i>Cu-On-Pa SFC</i> is a puzzle game in which the player takes control of a cube, the object being to roll this cube over squares of a particular colour. If the top face of the cube matches the colour of the square, it is collected; claim enough squares to move onto the next level.<br><br>Essentially, this is a Super Famicom port of the 1995 PC game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/endorfun\">Endorfun</a> - in fact, <i>Cu-On-Pa</i> is licensed from Endorfun. <i>Cu-On-Pa</i> features none of the new-age stylings of the earlier game, instead opting for a more traditional puzzle game aesthetic. This version offers a couple of new features over <i>Endorfun</i>: there is an Easy Mode, which reduces the available colours from six down to three; and there is also a Puzzle Mode which gives the player predefined boards to solve, and a limited number of moves to do so.",
