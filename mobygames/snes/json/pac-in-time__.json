  "description": "Pac-Man gets thrown back in time to his younger days after the nefarious Ghost Witch casted a spell on him for spoiling her plans. Now he has to find his way back to the present time. <br><br>Pac-Man has to go through several areas broken into ten sections each. To exit a section all of the pellets need to be collected in order for the exit to the section to appear. Pac-Man can jump and use tools. Tools include things such as hammers, fireballs, a bubble for underwater survival, and a climbing vine.<br><br>This version of <i>Pac-in-Time</i> should not be confused with other versions of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/pac-in-time\">Pac-in-Time</a> as the game engine, level layouts, and aesthetic are different.<br><br>",
