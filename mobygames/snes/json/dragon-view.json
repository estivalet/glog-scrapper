  "description": "Many years ago, four brave warriors have reclaimed the magical Drakkhen tears for humanity, liberating it from the yoke of powerful dragons. Alex, a descendant of one of those heroes, enjoys a peaceful life in the town of Rysis ans is about to marry his sweetheart Katarina. However, a mysterious wizard interferes and kidnaps the young woman. Alex embarks on a quest to locate and defeat him, unraveling an even more nefarious scheme in the process.<br><br><i>Dragon View</i> is an action role-playing game and a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/drakkhen\">Drakkhen</a>. Like its predecessor, it features a 3D overworld navigated from a first-person perspective. Towns and dungeons, however, are presented as side-scrolling areas. Alex can jump and fight enemies appearing in the dungeons with a sword or other weapons he can later acquire, such as a boomerang and a bow. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing enemies, and Alex's strength and defense parameters increase when leveling up. HP and magic points increase by finding specific items. It is also possible to find magical rings and weapon upgrades.",
