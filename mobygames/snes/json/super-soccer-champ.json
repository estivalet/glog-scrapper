  "description": "A soccer game that scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and uses a close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.<br><br>Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.<br><br>Depending on the version of the game some of teams change. The international teams included are:<br>\nArgentina, Brazil, England, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, France. and Spain. (Football Champ / Euro Football Champ - Arcade)<br>\nArgentina, Brazil, England, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, USA, and Japan.(Hat Trick Hero - Arcade)<br>\nArgentina, Brazil, England, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, France, and USA (Super Soccer Champ / Euro Football Champ - SNES)<br>\nArgentina, Brazil, England, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Japan, and USA (Hat Trick Hero - SNES)<br><br>A version of the game was released to coincide with the 1992 European Championships titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/euro-champ-92\">Euro Champ '92</a>. While the game is mainly the same, it focused only on European teams (additional ones were added to the ones that appear in this game) and also changes the way a super shot is performed.",
