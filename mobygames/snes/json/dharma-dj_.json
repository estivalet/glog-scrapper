  "description": "<i>Dharma D?j?</i> is a puzzle game, and conversion of an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/dharma-dj\">arcade game of the same name</a>. Unlike the arcade original where the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet, this version automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block. This port also features four game modes (two more than the arcade version).<br><br>In the story mode (??????), evil spirits have attacked and you must defeat them with the help of good spirits. Playing as either the monk or maiden, you must use a hammer to knock items to the left. These then appear in an area at the bottom of the screen. If all the items do not match, when the bottom area is full, the entire row moves back onto the screen, pushing the stacks up one level. If the items all match, they will turn into a good spirit and attack the evil spirit, slowing it. Do not delay, because the evil spirit is always climbing a rope to try to get to and cut a rope holding the temple bell. If the evil spirit cuts the temple bell rope or the stacks extend above the top level of the playing field, the game is over.<br><br>In the second game mode, referred to as Dhama Training Editing (??????), you begin with a stack of sixteen items, stacked four across and four high. You must create groups of the same four items at the bottom. While there is no evil spirit climbing on the left, you still cannot tarry. After a certain length of time, another block of sixteen items will drop onto the field. A bird-man will give you a countdown warning when this is about to occur and you can see what is coming next on the right. If the stacks extend to past the top of the playing field, the game is over.<br><br>In the third game mode, called Dharma Questions and Answers (?????), you are shown a pattern of items on the right. You must duplicate this pattern on the left, within a certain number of moves or within a time limit. If you succeed, you move to a more difficult pattern. If you fail, the game is over.<br><br>The last game mode is a two-player competitive game (??????). You must create groups of four of the same item at the bottom. If the group you create is four creatures, like cats or pigs, then a row of those will be added to the top of your competitor's stack. If you create a row of the same colored blocks, you will light one of your competitor's lamps. If you light all four of your competitor's lamps or your competitor's stack extends past the top of the playing field, you win a round. Win two out of three rounds to win the game.",
