  "description": "Somewhere deep in the city of Osaka, there's a notorious sports club known for producing some of Osaka's most notorious (yet toughest) street thugs. Its name is the Karate Club, based on the grounds of Kangokou High School. But now the club's in danger of losing that reputation. A bunch of would-be tough guys have come to Osaka, and are out to prove themselves against the club. It's up to Yoshiyuki Takagi, the leader of the club and of the Osaka thug scene, to turn them back and prove, once and for all, that his club is truly the toughest of the tough.<br><br>Based on the Japanese manga series, <i>Osu!! Karate Bu</i> is a fighting game similar to those being produced at the time in which a single player controlling Yoshiyuki Takagi battles through a series of tough men in order to prove his club's toughness. Each of the game's 12 characters has a life meter that must be reduced to 0, as well as a chi meter which not only allows players to execute special moves (depending on how much chi is left), but also helps players get back up after getting knocked out. (The quicker you get up, the more health you gain back.) But this can only be done twice per match, and if it happens three times you'll be down for the count.<br><br>In addition to the story mode, players can also choose to play an arcade mode in which any character can prove he's the toughest, as well as a 2-player VS mode and a team battle in which players choose teams of up to five combatants to battle against each other.",
