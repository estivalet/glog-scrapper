  "description": "As the hero, you must climb up a monster-ridden tower to defeat Drokkmar, master of the Blackorb. To do this, you must defeat his army that stands in your way with whatever weapon you are carrying. Health is decreased by coming into contact with various monsters, attacks, traps, and the passage of time. It is increased by finding food. Every certain amount of points, a &quot;Food Fairy&quot; appears and drops off food as well.<br><br>Throughout your journey, you can smash open chests to find treasure and artifacts. Some of these artifacts can be recovered that alter gameplay, such as providing more damage or increased magical power. Also throughout your journey, you can collect keys, which are used to free imprisoned allies, who not only help you defeat monsters, but also leave you an item that will help you on your quest. Only one person can join you at a time.<br><br>As you progress through the tower, you will be granted new magical weapons after each boss you defeat. The weapons are affected by a &quot;magic bar&quot; that charges over time. When this bar is fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by jumping and attacking, but doing this costs health.<br><br>There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.<br><br>",
