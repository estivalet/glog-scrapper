  "description": "The Madden football series makes a final appearance on the SNES with <i>Madden NFL 98</i>. With <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/madden-nfl-98\">PC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/madden-nfl-98_\">next-gen</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/madden-football-64\">console</a> versions having moved to 3D graphics, the SNES version retains the classic view of the series. Most of the playing modes are the same as on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/madden-nfl-98__\">Genesis</a>, but the SNES version has its own selection of teams and gameplay options.<br><br>Players can select from the 30 teams of the 1997 NFL season, the 1997 All-Madden team, an EA Sports and a THQ team, a Players, Inc. (NFLPA) team, plus 28 classic NFL teams - one per franchise minus the 1995 expansion teams and the 86 Browns for the Ravens. Playing modes include exhibition games (now optionally as a best-of-three or best-of-five series), seasons and playoffs. There is also an option to replay all Super Bowls since 1988. The game tracks records in 7 categories, pre-filled at the start with records to beat. A new feature are hot and cold streaks for teams, in which their recent playing history influences their current stats. Player creation and trading returns from the predecessors. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/madden-nfl-97___\">Madden 97</a> (but unlike in the Genesis version), players are created by performing a number of tryout mini-games, all of which can be practiced individually and for which records are tracked. During a season, there is detailed stats tracking, for the overall league, conference, or individual team. There are options for salary caps and trading deadlines in seasons and playoffs. Exclusive SNES features include stadium selection and optional windy weather.<br><br>",
