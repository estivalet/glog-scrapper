  "description": "<i>Harukanaru Augusta</i> is a golf game which allows the player to participate in a tournament on the Augusta National course.  The interface consists of three windows: the 3D window where the golfer and the ball movement is shown, an overhead map of the hole and a status window which shows where the ball is (e.g. on the green) and the wind direction. The controls follow the usual formula: first the player sets the used club, the feet position and the direction of the shot. Then the power (a moving line on a scale) and the drift (a moving dot on a golf ball) is determined by clicking with the correct timing to stop the line respectively dot.",
