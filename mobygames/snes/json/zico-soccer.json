  "description": "<i>Zico Soccer</i> is a soccer game supervised by the Brazilian former footballer Zico.<br><br>The game was released five months before Zico ended his career as a professional footballer. The team he was representing at that time (Kashima Antlers) is presented however all the other 24 teams selectable are national ones (non-club teams).<br><br>Modes available are the following: E.A. Cup, Zico Cup, Exhibition, Training, and Configuration. During a match you manage the players by using the SNES/Super Famicom mouse (sold separately) or the controller. The actions on-screen are designated on a HUD display window provided below the bottom of your screen. The arrow-shaped pointer is used to highlight positioned players by numbered icons, then watch as the action unfolds on a plane-sided viewpoint on the top of your screen.",
