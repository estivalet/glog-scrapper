  "description": "An enhanced remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/dragon-warrior-iii\">Dragon Warrior III</a>. Aside from a graphical and sound overhaul and other typical tweaks of a remake, this version of the game introduces a Thief class, more weapons, armors, items, and spells, a collectible mini medals sub-quest, searchable background objects, an extra dungeon (Sky World) with new monsters, and an additional boss monster. The game also includes a personality mechanic that effects how party members develop their attributes. Additionally, the game also has the five minigame boardgame tracks known as Pachisi (later known in the series as Treasures n' Trapdoors) added to it.<br><br>While the Super Famicom version had the above changes, the later released Game Boy Color remake has a few more additions. One addition is another bonus dungeon called the Ice Cave. This dungeon ties in with the other addition which are Monster Medals. Defeated monsters can now drop Monster Medals.  These medals are needed as they allow the player to explore deeper into the Ice Caves.<br><br>A remake was also released for mobile platforms. It borrows the appearance and most of the changes (including the bonus dungeon) of the Super Famicom version. However this version lacks the pachisi minigame. This version also lacks the monster medals and Ice Caves bonus dungeon of the Game Boy Color version too. A unique aspect of the mobile versions are they give the player the option to let the computer AI control their party members. The smartphone, Playstation 4, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch releases are based more closely on the mobile remake of the game.\n",
