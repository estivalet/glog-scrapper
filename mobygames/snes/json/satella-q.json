  "description": "<i>Satella-Q</i>, known as <i>Waiwai de Q</i> for the first three episodes, was a game show type quiz game broadcast on St.GIGA's BS-X Satellaview add-on for Nintendo's Super Famicom. The game is hosted by Toad from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a> It was the longest running Satellaview broadcast and the one with the most episodes, spanning a total of 28 episodes from October, 1995 to April, 1999. It utilized the Satellaview's Soundlink feature to have announcers read the questions aloud and stream radio-quality music in the background. Different types of questions are asked, such as multiple choice and actual text input. Categories also vary, such as pop culture trivia and asking questions in relation to images shown on the screen. There are also minigames included, such as controlling Toad to collect balls on a pool table and poker-like card games.",
