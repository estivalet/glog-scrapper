  "description": "A mystical television has challenged 2 kids to complete quests on various worlds. The first world is the Medieval World, land of castles, dungeons, undead skeleton warriors, malicious knights, and lots of keys and doors. The goal is to collect a number of puzzle pieces and get out of the world. Other world themes include Egyptian, Prehistoric, and Futuristic.<br><br>Dream TV is a 2-player action/adventure game with only a single player. The player must alternately control both kids throughout the game. The player can either adopt a split-screen view showing both kids, or a fullscreen view that focuses on one kid. The game includes challenges that require the player to use both kids simultaneously, such as a see-saw where both kids need to bounce on either end in order to propel one up onto a higher platform.",
