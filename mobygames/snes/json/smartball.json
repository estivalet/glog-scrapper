  "description": "King Geoffrey of Kyliria has recently passed away.  Jerry, his eldest son, was all set to take the throne, however his younger brother Tom was overcome with jealously and hired an evil wizard to kidnap Jerry's wife, and also turn his brother Jerry into a gelatinous ball. Now Tom will be able to rule over Kyliria unopposed. Players take on the role of the now transformed Jerry who is out to take back his kingdom and his wife, and of course regain his human form. <br><br>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of.<br><br>Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.<br><br>The Japanese version of this game contains towns in between levels, where the player has the option to speak with townspeople to move the storyline along. This element of the game was removed when it was later released in North America.",
