  "description": "<i>Super Tetris 3</i> is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line &quot;standard&quot; mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-tetris-2-bombliss\">Super Tetris 2</a>, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.<br><br>The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of <i>Tetris</i>. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.<br><br>Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.",
