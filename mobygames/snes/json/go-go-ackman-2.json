  "description": "<i>Go Go Ackman 2</i> is mostly the same as its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/go-go-ackman\">predecessor</a>, with a few small tweaks. The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.<br><br><i>Ackman 2</i> takes place over 5 stages filled with new bosses and enemies.",
