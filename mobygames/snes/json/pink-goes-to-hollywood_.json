  "description": "While having the same storyline as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/pink-goes-to-hollywood\">Genesis version</a>, this version has different level designs among other differences.<br><br>The game is set up with the opening level being a sort of hub world where other levels can be entered in any order. The levels themselves are based on movie set themes. Movies include Honey, I Shrunk the Pink, Pinkin Hood, Cat on a Hot Pink Roof, Pink Beard, Jungle Pink, The Pink Ranger, Pinkenstein, and The Polter Pink. There are also hidden safe rooms which can be found.<br><br>Players can find tokens throughout the levels which are in turn used to gain access to other levels or can be spent to use movie set items like bridges, stairs, and hooks or even an umbrella and a magic carpet which both can be used for temporary flight.<br><br>Besides hopping on enemies or spraying them with a Squirt sprayer, The Pink Panther can deal with enemies by using items from his bag of tricks like a fly swatter, a stoplight, a jackhammer, sledgehammer, a bowling ball, a detonator, or a white dog.<br><br>Options let the player choose how many lives they start with (3,4, or 5) and at what score intervals (25,000, 50,000, or 100,000) will the player earn an extra one.",
