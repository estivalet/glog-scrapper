  "description": "The intergalactic menace Belser has been long-defeated. However, he is rising again and is ready to cause trouble. Only a group of well-trained starpilots can defeat him. You take to the stars in this horizontal and sometimes vertical scrolling shooter. There are several power-ups to be obtained in your mission to defeat the evil Belser. <br><br>There are three ships to choose from, each having different weapons for attack. There are eight attack levels for each, increasing with each Red Orb collected. The Blue Orb gives a limited defense shield.",
