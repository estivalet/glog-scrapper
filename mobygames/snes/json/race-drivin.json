Game play is similar to the first game. The player must complete laps around the race track before a  timer expires. There are several checkpoints around the track which increase player's time as he passes. <br><br><i>Race Drivin'</i> has three courses, one of which is the track from <i>Hard Drivin'</i>. There is a new super-stunt track, and an autocross course. The player also may choose from three types of cars.",
