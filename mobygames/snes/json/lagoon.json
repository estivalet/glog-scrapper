  "description": "In the far off world of Lakeland, all was peaceful. This was until an evil being known as Zerah came and polluted all of the water, making people very sick. You play as Nasir, 'The Champion of Light', and are sent into the world to destroy the demons that seem to be linked to the muddy waters. On your quest of good you'll come across people in need and help them.  <br><br><i>Lagoon</i> is an action role-playing game. The hero is able to attack, jump, and cast magic. Defeating enemies in action-based combat grants the player character experience points, eventually leading to leveling up. The hero can also equip weapons and armor of various kinds.",
