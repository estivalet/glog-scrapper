  "description": "Like the original BS Zelda, <i>BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban</i> (BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets) was only available for a short time. It was to be downloaded onto the Satellaview, an add-on to the Super Famicom, and could only be played while it was being broadcast.<br><br>This game is very similar to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, in both gameplay and graphics, and is seen as a sequel of sorts to that game. Like the original BS Zelda, you play as one of the mascots of the BS-X Broadcasting System, and can play as a boy or a girl. Also like the original, this game was split into four parts.",
