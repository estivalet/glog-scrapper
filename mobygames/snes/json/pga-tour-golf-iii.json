  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Polygames\">The team at Polygames</a> make some small improvements to the series in <i>PGA Tour Golf III</i>. It has a US setting in terms of the courses and players, unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/pga-european-tour\">PGA European Tour</a>, with 8 licensed courses in total: Avenel, Las Colinas, River Highlands, Sawgrass, Scottsdale, Southwind, Summerlin and The Woodlands. Gameplay modes include three different practice options (driving range, putting green, and a full round) as well as a tournament, skins challenge, match play, and shoot-out.<br><br>Gameplay follows the standard model with swings made from of a view behind the golfer, with the customary three-click method (start, power, accuracy). Before taking a shot, the club choice, direction and intended draw/fade (spin on the ball) are selected. The game features instant replays and user-created players, stats and tournaments saved to battery-backed RAM. Only the Genesis version has course flybys with tips from PGA pros and switches to a different camera view for the ball's landing.",
