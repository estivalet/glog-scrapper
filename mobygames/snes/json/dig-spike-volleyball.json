  "description": "<i>Dig &amp; Spike Volleyball</i> is a volleyball game where the player can choose from two different venues, each with their own rules.  They can either choose an indoor event, where they can choose from International teams and compete in a 6 v. 6 person squad with rules and regulations, giving it an authentic feel.  There is also a 2 vs. 2 beach game where the gameplay is more relaxed which is ideal for beginners to the game, letting them learn the basic's such as serving, spiking and blocking.<br><br>There is also a practice mode that shows players the controls of the game and helps get them started. The game also contains two-player action that allows friends to compete head-to-head.",
