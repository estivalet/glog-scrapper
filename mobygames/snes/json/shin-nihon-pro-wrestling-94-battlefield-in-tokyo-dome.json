  "description": "<i>Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling 94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome</i> allows the players to experience Japan's most popular professional wrestling promotion, <i>New Japan Pro Wrestling</i>. The game features real wrestlers from the time period it was released in. The wrestlers appear as digitized photos in the intro sequence and on the character selection screens; during gameplay, they are rendered as 2D graphical images.<br><br>The game has four gameplay modes; the &quot;battle mode&quot; allows the player to choose one wrestler and compete against opponents chosen and controlled by the computer AI. The other modes correspond to a league, a cup (knock-out stages only), and a &quot;versus&quot; mode, in which the player can also choose any opponent to compete against. In every mode, the player is able to choose between single match (one-on-one) and tag team, with an additional wrestler on each side. The league mode allows competition between up to four players.<br><br>The combat system is similar to that of fighting games, with a side view and health bars for the wrestlers.",
