  "description": "<i>RockFall</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> variant, originally made in the 90s as a homebrew ROM and in 2013 released on a cartridge for the first time. The game contains six levels with the standard gameplay of digging to collect crystals and avoiding falling boulders. The player's character is a futuristic, mechanical creature/robot. The difficulty level gradually increases and levels have a time limit. Five lives are available. The game uses the console's Mode 7 feature to zoom in when a crystal is collected. The same function is also used to rotate the level when it is completed and sometimes it is used during the game as well, causing the rocks to fall in the opposite direction.",
