  "description": "After trying to rescue a drowning young woman, a young magician named Merlin is drawn into a fantasy world which is threatened by the evil Shadow King. Naturally, it is his job to save this world and also to rescue the aforementioned woman, who has been kidnapped by the Shadow King.<br><br><i>Young Merlin</i> is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The hero has to fight enemies using spells that are gathered during the progress of the game, as well as solve puzzles, interact with the game's inhabitants, and use several objects. What sets this title apart from similar games is the fact that there is no text in the entire game; instead, icons are used to represent conversations. Furthermore, the game uses passwords instead of a battery to record the player's progress.",
