  "description": "Another top-down shooter in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Twinbee\">Twinbee</a> &quot;cute'em up&quot; franchise.<br><br>Heroes Light and Pastel decide to go out and help a young maiden bring sense back to her scientist father, who apparently has bumped his head and transformed into a evil mastermind that seeks world domination.<br><br>As the other games in the series Pop'n Twinbee is a vertically-scrolling arcade shooter in which you and a friend get behind the controls of Twinbee and Winbee, the cutest starfighters ever created, and try to clear stage after stage of enemies with your  weapons. Being a console original instead of a port, Pop'n features a number of additions to the gameplay mechanics, including an energy bar, eight difficulty levels and a handicap feature when playing with a friend (which makes most enemies target one fighter instead of the other).<br><br>The upgrade system remains consistent with the series's: you shoot colored bells which give different power-ups when collected, including multiple shots, &quot;options&quot; and shield energy. Also when correctly powered-up both fighters can join and perform powerful team-up moves.",
