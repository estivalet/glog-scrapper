  "description": "This is a baseball game featuring 12 fictional teams, plus the player can also create 2 custom teams. Game modes include an Exhibition mode, an All Star game, a Pennant Race, and a Watch mode.<br><br>While Exhibition mode can be either a one or two player affair, the All Star game is strictly for two players to compete in. When playing, batting and pitching are both done from a behind the batter viewpoint.<br><br>The pennant race involves 6 teams playing each other throughout a season consisting of a number of games chosen by the player.<br><br>Watch mode lets the player watch two computer controlled teams play each other.<br><br>Options include either having automatic or manual fielding, having errors and/or wind on or off, and being able to either skip or watch opponents pennant games. There is also the Cold Game option, which lets a baseball game end when a team is winning by the  chosen amount of runs.",
