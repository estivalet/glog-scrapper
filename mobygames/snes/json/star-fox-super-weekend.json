  "description": "Star Fox Competition Weekend Edition is a rare version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/star-fox_\">Star Fox</a> (StarWing in Europe) that was sold as a promotional item in certain shops. In Europe &amp; North America it was used for competitions (local and nationwide) to see who could get the most points. Prizes included Nintendo T-Shirts, promotional items, or even holiday destinations.<br><br>This version has a different game system.\nInstead of seeing the map screen, you will immediately get stuck in. You will see that there is a time limit, and a score.\nAs far as can be seen, you can't get past Stage 3, which was specially made for the promotion.<br><br>After the time runs out, Slippy will appear in close-up, telling you &quot;Time Up!&quot;. A Hi-Score screen will appear with your score.\nAfter that it just restarts.",
