The Gromble, a headmaster in monster school, needs you to perform the final test - monster Midterm Exam - in order to prove yourselves to be <i>real</i> monsters. You should collect trash, throw it on people, and scare them!<br><br>This is a platform game, where you control three characters. Each one of them has a special move that is often used to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles: Ickis can fly for a short time, Oblina can reach high ledges, and Krumm can scan off-screen areas.
