  "description": "In <i>Marvelous: M?hitotsu no Takarajima</i>, the famous pirate Captain Maverick is said to have left behind a great treasure known as the &quot;Marvelous.&quot; The treasure is said to be protected by unsolvable puzzles and bizarre creatures. While many have gone looking for this treasure, none have ever returned. Now, a group of children on a field trip have landed on the island rumored to house the treasure, as did a group of pirates trying to get the treasure at all costs.<br><br>The game focuses on a group of three 12-year-old boys, Dion, Max, and Jack. Their teacher, Ms. Gina, helps them by giving them items to help organize their group. The game, influenced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past\">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a>, is played by interacting with other characters and things. When the player encounters someone or something, a command window shows up with choices of how the player wants to interact with them.",
