  "description": "<i>Super Batter Up</i> is a baseball game with both a 1 and 2 player mode plus a league mode. The game carries the MLBPA license, but not an MLB license, so it only features  all the players from the 1991 season playing for a team in a city that they really play for. Players get to play in either a dome, modern, or traditional stadium each with their own unique characteristics.<br><br>The 1 and 2 player mode lets the player play an exhibition game against the computer or another player. League mode lets the player play through a season of games against computer controlled teams.<br><br>Pitching and batting are done from a behind the batter viewpoint. When batting players can sub in a pinch hitter and when on base, a pinch runner, and when pitching can call in a relief pitcher from the bullpen. <br><br>Game options include setting the number of innings (1,3,5,7,or 9), turning errors on or off, and turning the called game option on or off.",
