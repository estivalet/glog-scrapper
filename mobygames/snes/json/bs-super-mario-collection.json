  "description": "<i>BS Super Mario Collection</i> is an altered version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-all-stars\">Super Mario All-Stars</a>. It was only released via broadcast on the Satellaview add-on for Super Famicom. It consists of four episodes, broadcast over a period of four weeks. It consists of levels from the <i>Super Mario All-Stars</i> versions of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros-3\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>. Using the Soundlink feature, radio-quality music was streamed during the broadcast, including music from Mario-related CDs of the time as well as licensed music. There was also some narration, as well as added cutscenes. Some minor changes were also made to gameplay. These include a simplified Toad House, and Fire Flower and Treasure Ship icons on the overworld maps. The Fire Flower icon allows Mario to become Fire Mario after exiting a level, and the Treasure Ship icon appears after clearing all levels in a World, allowing easier and more frequent access to them. Finally, a timer is added that counts down to the end of the World cycle.",
