  "description": "When Yogi Bear catches wind of a plan to turn Jellystone Park into a Chemical plant he sets out on a mission to stop it. Play as Yogi in this side-scrolling Action/Adventure that is fit for all ages. Work your way through the five park areas collecting &quot;Pic-i-nic&quot; baskets by bouncing on top of them. In many cases you bounce from one basket to the next raising you into the air where no &quot;average bear&quot; could ever go. There are a variety of enemies such as weasels and skunks. There are also some action parts where you ride a mine cart or go &quot;beaver surfing&quot;. ",
