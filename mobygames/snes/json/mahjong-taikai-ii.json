  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mahjong-taikai\">Mahjong Taikai</a> enhances the formula found in its predecessor. The player can now directly participate in the grand tournament mode; characters are divided into groups of four, and the player works his or her way upwards through elimination rounds. The sequel also features rudimentary character creation, allowing the player to choose the gender and a portrait of the player characters. <br><br>The character roster has been expanded and modified to include other types of characters rather than famous warlords such as Caesar and Napoleon. The player can now compete against notable literary figures and artists (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=nostradamus\">Nostradamus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Sei+Sh%c5%8dnagon\">Sei Sh?nagon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=mozart\">Mozart</a>) and even popular fictional characters such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=sherlock+holmes\">Sherlock Holmes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=sinbad\">Sinbad</a>.",
