  "description": "When an evil fiend called the Tyrant hijacks and spoils the dreams of small children, two bold leprechauns named Flynn and Floyd jump into action to stop him. Armed with razor-sharp playing cards, the courageous brothers can also summon magical attacks to destroy the various beasts they encounter. Traversing the inner depths of the dream world, they must overcome all the Tyrant's minions before facing the bloated monster himself.<br><br><i>Nightmare Busters</i> is a standard run and gun action game which requires quick reflexes to complete. The game can be played alone, or by two players who take on the monster hordes simultaneously in a cooperative effort.",
