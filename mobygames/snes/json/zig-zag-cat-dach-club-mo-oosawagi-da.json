  "description": "Restoring the lands from evil, saving the princess, and finding a way back home might not be the most original of goals; but this game also includes comedy stylings of the Japanese performance group Dach? (Ostrich) Club to complement the traditional storytelling.<br><br><i>Zig Zag Cat</i> is a somewhat unusual fusion of <i>Breakout</i> and a scrolling shooter. During action stages the player's avatar walks forward while attempting to keep their cat from bouncing off the bottom of the screen. The cat can break most obstacles by hitting them, and all obstacles will be broken if they collide with the avatar. By breaking blocks money and temporary paddle upgrades can be uncovered, such as ones that increase the size or the paddle, let you fire bullets, or allow you to curve the cat while it is moving. Several times during each stage a black octopus block will appear, and it must be destroyed by the cat before the player's avatar will continue moving forward. While the avatar is totally unharmed from walking through any enemies or blocks, some enemies and all bosses have the ability to fire projectiles at him which do cause damage, and if all health is lost from projectiles then a life will be lost just as if the cat had fallen off the screen.<br><br>In between action stages the player will enter an Inn. At the Inn he can save, talk to the locals, play a bonus board to earn additional money, buy temporary paddle upgrades, and check his progress on his trip around the island.",
