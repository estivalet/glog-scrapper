  "description": "A boy and his dog live together in the town of Podunk.  One day, the boy chases the dog into an old abandoned mansion where a scientist lived thirty years ago.  Some of his equipment is still operational, and when the dog chews on it, they are both sent to the strange world of Evermore, and have to figure out how to get back.<br><br><i>Secret of Evermore</i> is an action RPG similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Secret+of+Mana\">Secret of Mana</a>, with a few key changes.  Multiplayer is out.  Rather than three characters, there are just the two. The equivalent of magic is alchemy, where each effect requires several base ingredients which the player gathers as the game advances.",
