  "description": "Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment. Gameplay is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a> series in that the player controls a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose the ship's upgrade. The upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.<br><br>In <i>Gokuj? Parodius!</i>, the player is now able to now choose from eleven different characters, many of whom appear in other Konami games. They include Vic Viper, a ship from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a>; Takosuke, &quot;octopus&quot; of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Goemon\">Goemon</a>; Twinbee from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Twinbee\">Twinbee</a> side scrolling games; Pentaro, the original &quot;joke character&quot;, who made an appearance in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin and stars in his own game as well, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/penguin-adventure\">Konami's Penguin Adventure</a>; Dracula, star of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kid-dracula\">Konami's Kid Dracula</a>, and others.<br><br>In addition to these protagonists, the levels themselves are full of Konami references, bright colors, and humorous design elements. For example, it is not uncommon to have to fly a ship underneath a woman's legs, chased by a giant walrus, having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at the protagonist, etc.",
