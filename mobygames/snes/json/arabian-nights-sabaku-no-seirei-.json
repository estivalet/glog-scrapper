  "description": "<i>Arabian Nights: Sabaku no Seirei-?</i> is a Japanese role-playing game released for the Super Famicom. The game starts with the Djinn Ifrit being defeated by a sorcerer named Suleiman. Suleiman then makes Ifrit his servant. One day Suleiman is defeated by a mysterious sorcerer, robbing Ifrit from the opportunity to take revenge on the man that enslaved him for so long. With his last strength Suleiman seals Ifrit in a magical ring and so gives him the opportunity to take revenge on the person that robbed him of his revenge. The game follows a girl named Shukran who finds the ring containing Ifrit helps him to regain his power and seek revenge on the mysterious sorcerer who defeated his master and ultimately grant his freedom.<br><br>Arabian Nights employs a turn-based battle system that is traditional with a unique hook. Elemental barrier cards alter the entire playing field and affect both players and enemies alike. Cards come in one of nine attributes and five levels, with higher levels producing greater effects. Both players and enemies can lay down barrier cards to swing the battle in their favor.<br><br>The game is nonlinear to a great extent. The main objective is to collect all of the elemental crystals and restoring Ifrit to full power. The order these are done is left to the player. Compared to most role-playing games Arabian Nights is short at 10-15 hours but does have multiple endings depending on your actions.",
