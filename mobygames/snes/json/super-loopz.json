  "description": "Super Loopz is a revamped version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/loopz\">Loopz</a>. Feature enhanced graphics and new musics, but the same gameplay: sort of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> encounter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pipe-dream\">Pipe Dream</a>. Tubes of random shapes drop on to a board, and by rotating and placing them you have to make shapes that join up in loops. Once you have placed a piece you can't remove it, except by using a special items which destroy every part of an incomplete loop it touches; every tenth loop takes you to a new level.<br><br>",
