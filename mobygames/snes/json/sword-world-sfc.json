  "description": "<i>Sword World SFC</i> is a game based on the tabletop role-playing game <i>Sword World</i> by Group SNE, released for the Japanese SNES, Super Famicom, hence the SFC on the title. Comparing to other J-RPG's, the game is more like western RPG's, where you have to create your character, choose his race, classes and stats, rather than having a set hero for the story. The game is supposed to follow roughly the same rules as the tabletop books.<br><br>The story is set in the world of Forceria, which is in the same universe as the anime/manga Record of Lodoss War, and has many similarities to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, having races such as humans, elves, dwarfs, Grass Runners (Halfling like creatures), and half-elves. Classes available include: fighter, thief, ranger, sage, bard, sorcerer, shaman and priest. You start the game with 2500 experience points, which you can use to &quot;buy&quot; classes for you character. Combat is turn based, and experience points come in very slowly.<br><br>In 1994 a sequel was released, called <i>Sword World SFC 2 Inishie no Kyojin Densetsu</i> (Legend of the Ancient Giant).",
