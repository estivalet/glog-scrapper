  "description": "Long before the WWE introduced the <i>Divas</i> wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were &quot;real&quot; (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.<br><br>In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.<br><br>Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used. ",
