The brothers (Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce and Olaf the Stout) are trying to get back home and you need to guide them through.  Two brand new characters (Fang the Werewolf and Scorch the Dragon) also join the fray.  Each character has their own special talents and they must be used in concert if you are to win.",
