  "description": "<i>F1 Pole Position 2</i> is basically the same game as its predecessor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/f1-pole-position\">F1 Pole Position</a>. It is a racing game based on the Formula 1 with the possibilities to participate in the World Grand Prix (a whole season), battle mode (a single race with configurable parameters like number of laps) and training. The game is more on the realistic side of the genre and allows to customize many parts of the car, e.g. brakes, tires of shifting. <br><br>Changes in comparison to the predecessor include a few updated licenses, multiple difficulty levels and full screen graphics when playing alone.",
