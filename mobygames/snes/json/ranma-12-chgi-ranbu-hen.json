You can also charge up your character until he reaches &quot;super&quot; mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.<br><br>Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.",
