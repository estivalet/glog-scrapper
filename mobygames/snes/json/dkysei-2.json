  "description": "<i>D?ky?sei 2</i> is a classic &quot;love adventure&quot;, a genre that is also referred to (quite erroneously) as &quot;dating simulations&quot;. You are a high-school student, whose father is a famous archaeologist traveling around the world, and whose mother died when he was a child. It is now your third year at the 88 High School, and naturally, your primary concern is your love life. Will you be able to date successfully and to come to a happy ending with one of the fifteen lovely female classmates?<br><br>The game mechanics are a lot like in a &quot;standard&quot; adventure game (examine objects, visit various locations, talk to people, make decisions), but the plot centers exclusively around your relationship with the girls. The game has its own internal clock. You can move around your character on a &quot;city map&quot;, visiting different locations. Every visit takes 20-30 minutes of game time. You can make appointments and visit various places at a specific time. The decisions you make influence the story.",
