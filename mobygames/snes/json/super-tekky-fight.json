  "description": "<i>Super Tekky? Fight!</i> is a maze action game by Banpresto and a spinoff in the Compati Hero Series.  Players control one of the four Compati Heroes (Kamen Rider Black RX, Gundam RX-78, Fighter Roa, and Ultraman) as they defeat enemies within a time limit to move on.  Though similar in style and appearance to Bomber Tekkyuu Fight differs in that its heroes use melee weapons, specifically a ball and chain.  There are numerous power-ups that not only increase its power but also its length and size.  Enemies can be stunned by jumping on their heads and you can flip tiles to achieve the same effect.  The ability to jump is heavily relied on in later stages to navigate each map and reach enemies before is up.  These features helped Super Tekkyuu Fight! differentiate itself from Hudson's series.<br><br>The game features an extensive single player story mode that is nonlinear, complete with bosses at the end of each world.  Characters are drawn from all four heroes' respective series (with the exception of original character Fighter Roa) to add variety and depth.  There is also a multiplayer mode with 8 zones that feature their own unique hazards.  ",
