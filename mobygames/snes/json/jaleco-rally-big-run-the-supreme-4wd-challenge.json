  "description": "<i>Jaleco Rally: Big Run - The Supreme 4WD Challenge</i> is partly based on the arcade game <i>Big Run</i>. The player participates in the Paris-Dakar rally with the basic goal to finish all nine stages of the race within a time limit. The driving itself is action oriented with two gears.<br><br>However, the major difference to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/big-run\">computer/arcade  version</a> is the addition of a few strategic components. Before starting the tour, the player has the choice between different sponsors. The given money is then reinvested into a navigator which tells the player the desired driving direction (sometimes jungle or darkness obfuscates the path) and spare parts. Those are important because every part of the car has only a limited durability and it may be needed to repair them during a race stage. if the parts are not available right away, the player has to take a major hit on the time limit. Repairs can also be conducted between the single race stages. Another aspect that needs to be calculated in is the weight of the spare parts: the more parts in the car, the lesser the maximum speed.",
