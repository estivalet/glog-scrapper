  "description": "In the first of three released games for Super NES, players can choose among 4 different cars, each one with different attributes (maximum speed, fuel consumption, boost power and tire grip) to face 32 challenging courses situated in several places around the world as Brazil, USA, France, Japan etc.<br><br>In more longer tracks, players will find a Pit Stop section, where they can enter to replenish the fuel meter (total or partially). The game has a split-screen display for 1 or 2 players. In 1-Player mode, you'll dispute the races against the computer, that has a slightly bigger speed than yours, helping to give a lot more of competitiveness. A password system was included, being possible to stop a current game and resume it later.<br><br>Through the game, players will find several obstacles scattered by the courses, like rows of iron plates or even lots of stones. In order to qualify for the next circuit, it's required to complete it at least in the 5th position, or else the game is over.",
