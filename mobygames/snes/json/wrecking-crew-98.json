  "description": "<i>Wrecking Crew '98</i> is the sequel to the 1985 NES/Famicom game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wrecking-crew\">Wrecking Crew</a>. Bowser is constructing high-rises that are depriving the local plantlife of sunlight, and Mario decides to destroy the buildings in order to help. However, Bowser has recruited Mario's old construction boss and enemy Foreman Spike to prevent this from happening.<br><br>The two-player mode differs from the original's as two players play simultaneously against each other. The original <i>Wrecking Crew</i> is also available on the game as a bonus. Originally released as a download for the Nintendo Power cartridge, it was later given a standard cartridge release.",
