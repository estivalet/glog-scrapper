  "description": "<i>The Super Aquatic Games</i> was conceived partly as an Olympics tie-in, and partly as a stop-gap for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=James+Pond\">James Pond</a> fans (the third platform title in the series (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/james-pond-3-operation-starfish\">Operation Starfish</a>) was in the process of being heavily delayed, eventually being released in 1994). This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.<br><br>The events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hyper-sports\">Hyper Sports</a>, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the <i>James Pond series</i> (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.",
