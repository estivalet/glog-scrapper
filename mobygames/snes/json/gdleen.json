He finds himself in a middle of a forest on a planet he knows nothing about. It is not until he meets the beautiful, mysterious fairy named Fana, who tells him the planet is in grave danger, that he realizes that his fate and the fate of the planet are connected, and becomes involved in a conflict between two local tribes.<br><br><i>Gdleen</i> is a Japanese-style role-playing game based on the light novel series <i>Jik?
