  "description": "Franky and his girlfriend Bitsy are planning a vacation to New York. There's just one problem: Bitsy doesn't have a passport. Our protagonist comes up with a brilliant idea: He takes Bitsy apart and mails her to New York in different packages, where he will put her back together. Unfortunately for the couple, Bitsy has been lost in the mail. It is up to Franky to find her parts and put her back together.<br><br><i>The Adventures of Dr. Franken</i> is a standard platformer where the player navigates platforms and avoids enemies. Touching too many enemies result in death. To defeat himself Franky has the ability to kick foes. The goal of every level is to find a package which is hidden in it. To reach it Franky also has to solve switch puzzles. There are overall 20 levels including four bonus levels.",
