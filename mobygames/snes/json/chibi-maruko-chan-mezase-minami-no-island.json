  "description": "They say that news travels fast... and at a typical Japanese school in the 1970's, it travels even faster! One particular day, for instance, it was announced that a representative of the school can go as an exchange student to a tropical paradise in the South Seas. But one of the students, a total slacker known as Maruko-chan, thinks it's just an excuse to soak up some rays. Furthermore, two of her schoolmates, Tama-chan and Hanawa, also have an interest in filling that one spot. Not one to let even good friends come between her and a relaxing beach vacation, Maruko-chan has proposed a representative battle pitting the three against one another in games of &quot;friendly&quot; competition. Will Maruko's plan succeed, or is she, like the ocean, all wet?<br><br>Based on the Japanese manga and anime &quot;Chibi Maruko-chan&quot;, <i>Chibi Maruko-chan: Mezase! Minami no Island!!</i> pits Maruko-chan and three of her friends against each other in a series of minigames where the main objective is to flatten the opposition and be the last one standing. On occasion, other characters may pop up to make things more interesting, and power-ups may also appear to give the character an advantage. There are three types of minigames that can be played:<br><br><b>Dodgeball</b> - Players must attack the opposition with a dodgeball, while at the same time trying to avoid getting hit by either their opponent's dodgeball... or their own!<br><br><b>Painting</b> - Using paint rollers, players must make their opponents slip up... while at the same time watching how much paint really is left.<br><br><b>Sumo</b> - Players must bump their opponents into the water.<br><br>In all of the games, when a character has lost all three lives, that character is eliminated from play, and the last character standing wins the round. Two victories out of three wins the stage.<br><br>In addition, the player can also participate in a series of bonuses: a trivia game, a painting program in which up to four players can work together on the same drawing, a fortune-teller program, and a karaoke program.",
