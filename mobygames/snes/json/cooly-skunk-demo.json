  "description": "<i>Cooly Skunk</i> was a child-friendly 2D platformer being developed by Ukiyotei for the Super Famicom. The 16-bit version was quietly cancelled in favour of a reworked PlayStation version <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/punky-skunk\">Punky Skunk</a>, but a three-world demo was published for the Satellaview online service.<br><br>The story is basically the same: an evil wolf threatens the day with his mouse army, so Cooly Skunk has to set out to defeat him. Cooly Skunk can defeat enemies by swiping his tail, and can also collect various power-ups like a pogo stick and a snowboard to navigate levels.",
