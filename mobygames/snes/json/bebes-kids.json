  "description": "This side-scrolling beat em' up game is based on a 1992 Paramount Pictures animated movie which was the first ever to feature an all-Black main cast. The characters were originally from comedian Robin Harris' &quot;Bébé's Kids&quot; (pronounced Bay-Bay) stand-up comedy act. They're described as little hellions and bad-ass troublemaker kids.  In this game, someone has taken control of the Fun World amusement park, and you've got to help Kahlil, LaShawn, and PeeWee make things right. <br><br>You can play as either Kahlil or LaShawn and can use each character's different special attacks. Kahlil uses a spin-tuck to take out almost any enemy you meet and LaShawn uses powerful cartwheels. Enemies such as animatronic robots and security guards must be taken out in the first time-limited level.  Some items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.   The second level has the baby PeeWee in a china shop knocking glasses off shelves and you must break 10 before they hit you or the ground or are grabbed by your caretaker Robin.  There is also a haunted house maze level where you must keep trying different doors until you find the exit\nwhile avoiding mummies along the way. Then there's a pirate ship beat em' up level and eventually you make your way to the underground control center and the Big Boss.",
