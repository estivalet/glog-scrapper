  "description": "Peace in the world of Popples is being threatened by the devil king Thanatos, who has cast a spell over the world. Lip, the Fairy of Flowers, escaped the grasp of this spell, and must free her friends, the other fairies, and defeat the evil king to restore peace to the land.<br><br><i>Panel de Pon</i> is a fact-paced action puzzler that belies its cute exterior with extremely fast-paced matches. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.<br><br>The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. A reworked version of the game, which changes all the characters to ones from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island\">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a>, was released internationally as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tetris-attack\">Tetris Attack</a>.",
