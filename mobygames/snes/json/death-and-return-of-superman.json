  "description": "&quot;Doomsday&quot; is here and only Superman can stop him. Unfortunately in doing so he gets killed himself. Now four other characters emerge, each claiming to be the real hero. The story starts you off with Superman, then Steel, the Eradicator, the Cyborg, and Superboy. Each character has slightly varied moves so different strategies apply when playing as them.<br><br>The gameplay is basically that of a standard beat-em-up, with the punches, throws and specials moves.",
