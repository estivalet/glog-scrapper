  "description": "The game is based on the anime series &quot;Doraemon&quot;. Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.<br><br>The game primarily consists of platform action stages, which an exploration mode thrown in. In this mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.",
