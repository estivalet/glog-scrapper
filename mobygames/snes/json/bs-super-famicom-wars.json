Gone are the campaign, story sequences and multiplayer modes from the original game. <i>BS Super Famicom Wars</i> pits the player's skill against a variety of enemy foes.

Each city controlled by the player generates money which can be used to purchase new units. Each individual unit has unique statistics and is often best used against certain types of enemy units.",
