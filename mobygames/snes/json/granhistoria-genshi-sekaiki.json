Everything is ready for your marriage, the priest of the god Za your village worship is preparing to guide the ceremony. Strolling outside in the evening, you find a strange-looking shiny item. Immediately afterwards you are attacked by thieves and are... killed? A mysterious World Sphere contacts your soul and brings you back to life. But you are sent to the world a few hours into the past, just before the thieves' assault on you and on the village. You have to prevent the assault, to stop a chain of events, and to change world history! As you venture into the thieves' hideout to find out more about their plans, you find yourself involved in a struggle between the thieves' leader and the king's generals, and soon realize you must play a very important role in the history of the world...<br><br>The gameplay of <i>Granhistoria</i> is connected to its main concept: changing the history.
