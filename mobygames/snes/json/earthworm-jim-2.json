  "description": "An ordinary average earthworm named Jim goes about his normal daily life, cruising around avoiding crows and doing other general worm-like things. Until one day, Jim is suddenly struck by a very large Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place. Jim soon realizes that he is now in control of the suit.<br><br><i>Earthworm Jim 2</i>'s gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Earthworm+Jim\">the first game</a>, with Jim running and jumping through the levels. There are five weapons more than in the original game to collect. Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and Psy-Crow also appear.",
