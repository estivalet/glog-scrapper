  "description": "<i>Super Bases Loaded 3</i> is the follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-bases-loaded-2\">Super Bases Loaded 2</a> which includes updated stats of over 700 actual MLBPA players including Barry Bonds, Kirby Puckett and Terry Gwynn, just to name a few.  The modes of play include the standard <i>Exhibition</i> and <i>Season</i>, but also include a <i>Championship Tournament</i> and an <i>MVP Game</i>.  However, since there is no MLB license, there are no team nicknames or logos, and also no World Series is  included in the game. The game only contains three generic stadiums.  A battery back-up is present that allows players to save games.",
