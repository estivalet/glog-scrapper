  "description": "<i>Human Grand Prix IV: F1 Dream Battle</i> is the last title of the Human Grand Prix series released on the Super Famicom.<br><br>The game structure remains the same as the previous titles however few new features have been implemented naturally. The most notable is that during races (for single player-only), a view showing the other drivers or the &quot;top group&quot; can be chosen. The game is based on the 1995 Formula One season however there's the mode &quot;Dream World Grand Prix&quot; in which the player can compete in the three previous seasons.\n",
