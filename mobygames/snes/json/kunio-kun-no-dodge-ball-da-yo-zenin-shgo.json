  "description": "16-bit sequel to the cult-classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Dodge+Ball\">Super Dodge Ball</a> which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.<br><br>The game continues the &quot;Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament&quot; motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). <br><br>This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.<br><br>Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.",
