  "description": "<i>Super Formation Soccer 95: della Serie A</i> is the fourth title of the Super Formation Soccer series released on the Super Famicom. As the title suggests, the game is based on the 1994-95 Italian Seria A season.<br><br>Like the other Super Famicom installments in the series, the field is shown in a top-down perspective using Mode 7 scrolling. The fields themselves are facsimiles of actual Italian stadiums, with different grass types and home colors. At the beginning of a match in Serie A mode, a picture of the real-life stadium the field is based on is shown. The player can choose from 18 clubs, each with 22 players. However, each team can only have three foreign players (the initial release of this game preceded the &quot;Bosman ruling&quot; of 1995). Before a match begins, the player can choose different formations and whether the goalkeeper will be controlled automatically, semi-automatically or manually. <br><br>There are six modes available: Exhibition, Serie A, Situation, Practice, Edit Team, and Option. Adding to the realism, the player can choose to play matches in Italian (menus will continue to be in either English or Japanese). Certain real-life data on the players can also be viewed.",
