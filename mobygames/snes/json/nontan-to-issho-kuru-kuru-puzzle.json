  "description": "<i>Nontan to Issho: Kuru Kuru Puzzle</i> is a game based on a children’s anime and book series telling the story of a young kitten and his animal friends.<br><br>It is a block puzzle game the likes of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Falling+block+puzzles\">Tetris</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/baku-baku-animal\">Baku Baku Animal</a></i>, where the goal is to stack blocks in a way that matching ones are connected and therefore disappear. Unlike in Tetris games though, the blocks cannot be rotated – they can instead be flipped around to reveal different blocks on the reverse side. There’s also the usual bonus blocks that remove entire rows, as is common in this genre. A two-player mode is also featured, even though unlike what usually happens in two-player gameplay of puzzle games, the actions of one player will not affect the other directly (like having more blocks falling on your opponent’s screen after you scored pretty high).",
