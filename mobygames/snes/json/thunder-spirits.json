  "description": "<i>Thunder Spirits</i> is a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/thunder-force-iii\">Thunder Force III</a> made specifically for the arcades with reworked graphics - although still very close to what the Genesis was able to offer. <i>Thunder Spirits</i> puts you behind the cockpit of a lone starfighter out to destroy all the enemy forces of the Orn empire by clearing 8 enemy-infested stages set in various outer space locations. Most of the game levels are taken directly from the Genesis version with a few minor changes, though levels 4 and 5 are totally different - both in graphics and level design.<br><br>The game gives you a health-bar and the ability to swap collected weapons on the fly, which can be obtained by catching power-ups and activating them whenever you want.",
