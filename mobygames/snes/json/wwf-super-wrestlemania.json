  "description": "<i>WWF Super WrestleMania</i> is a wrestling game that uses rules and wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The game introduces a characteristic &quot;tug of war&quot; gameplay style, which involves two wrestlers grappling each other until one of them has the upper hand. The player has to repeatedly tap a button to execute this move. All the wrestlers share the same set of typical WWF moves such as scoop slams, suplexes, hip tosses, dropkicks, clotheslines, and elbow drops. The Genesis (MegaDrive) version adds signature moves unique to each characters.<br><br>The game's modes are one-on-one, tag team, and Survivor Series matches (four-on-four). The Genesis version also has a WWF Championship mode, which allows the player to select one wrestler and slowly move his way up by defeating other wrestlers in a tournament consisting of one-on-one matches. <br><br>",
