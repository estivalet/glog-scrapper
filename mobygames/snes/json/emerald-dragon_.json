  "description": "This version of <i>Emerald Dragon</i> differs in several significant aspects from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fmtowns/emerald-dragon\">earlier releases</a>. The most notable changes include:\n<ul><li>World map: unlike the other versions, this release has a traditional &quot;world map&quot; with separate locations displayed as icons, rather than a continuous environment.\n<li>Side quests: the three major side quests in the game have been removed and replaced by a new location, a Ghost Town, which contains a different sub-quest.\n<li>Dungeon layout: the dungeons are noticeably shorter and less complex than in the other versions.\n<li>Additional items: the dungeons also contain many more treasure chests.\n<li>Inventory: the inventory in this version is &quot;bottomless&quot;, i.e. the party can carry an unlimited amount of items, as opposed to the earlier releases.\n<li>New attacks: the protagonist Atrushan has a set of new powerful dragon attacks.\n<li>Character growth: the characters gain much more HP when leveling up than in all the other versions.\n<li>Cutscenes: all full-screen cutscenes have been either removed or replaced by those made with in-game engine.</li></ul>",
