  "description": "The Avatar is once again summoned to the land of Britannia, and this time he has to investigate ritual murders that have occurred in the town of Trinsic. Meanwhile, a new philosophical/social doctrine is spreading through Britannia, promoted by the mysterious Fellowship...<br><br>The story of this version of <i>Ultima VII</i> is essentially the same as in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/ultima-vii-the-black-gate\">original PC version</a>. However, the dialogues have been greatly reduced and/or simplified. This applies also to the size of the game's cities and other locations, the amount of items to pick up, interior details, etc.<br><br>Combat also underwent significant changes. The battles in this version are action-based; the player has to click on the enemy repeatedly to win. Unlike the PC version with its party management, the Avatar is traveling and fighting solo in this release.",
