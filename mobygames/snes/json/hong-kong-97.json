  "description": "The year is 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China, the protectionist Hong Kong government fears an invasion and dispatches Bruce Lee's brother Chin to slaughter anyone he comes across. Somehow, a reincarnated Tong Shau Ping is leading the Chinese forces and acts as Chin's greatest enemy.<br><br>This chaotic shooter has Chin firing bullets into endless numbers of enemies while dodging their bullets. After surviving the onslaught for long enough, Tong Shau Ping appears as the game's only boss. Defeating him leads the game to start over again, continuing until the player dies. All of the characters are depicted via crude digitzed sprites, while the backgrounds are assorted vaguely thematic images. Throughout the game, a five-second loop of the children's song I Love Beijing Tiananmen loops continuously.",
