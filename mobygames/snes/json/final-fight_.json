  "description": "The SNES version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/final-fight\">Final Fight</a> some significant differences to the original: there is one less level (the factory level is gone), one less character to choose from (only Haggar and Cody are available) and no multiplayer. There is also a sprite restriction of three enemies at the same time in place.<br><br>There are also some minor differences such as different enemies (all female ones were replaced with males), different boss names (Damnd became Thrasher and Sodom became Katana), a removed power-up (Whiskey) and the outcry &quot;Oh My God!&quot; was changed to &quot;Oh My Car!&quot;. <br><br>The later released <i>Final Fight Guy</i> is essentially the same game, but the second playable character is Guy instead of Cody. There is also a small change in the intro: Guy says that Cody is still in Japan training his martial arts skills so it is up to him to save Jessica. ",
