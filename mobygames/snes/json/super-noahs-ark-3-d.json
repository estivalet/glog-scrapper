  "description": "<i>Super Noah's Ark 3-D</i> is a First Person Shooter based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Wolfenstein+3D\">Wolfenstein</a> engine with a biblical twist.<br><br>As Noah, the player travels around the Ark feeding the restless animals in order to put them to sleep; this is achieved by firing feed (ammo) at them using a variety of hand catapults.<br><br>The SNES version is largely a reskin of the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D, the only notable difference being slightly altered behaviour for a couple of bad guys. Even your weapons are reskins that behave exactly like the guns from Wolf3D; Noah must be very skilled to operate a catapult at the speed of a machine gun!.<br><br>The PC version however, while still a reskin of Wolf3D in gameplay has some more advanced features; higher resolution graphics (along the lines of the Jaguar and 3DO versions of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=wolfenstein-3d%5f\">the game</a>, albeit with all 8 directions like the original PC version), midi music support, floor textures (like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=blake-stone-aliens-of-gold\">Blake Stone</a>) and a new game play feature in the form of a question mark pickup; picking one up pauses the game and brings up a random multiple choice question about content in the bible. Answer the question correctly and you get a bunch of ammo and points.",
