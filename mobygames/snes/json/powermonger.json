  "description": "<i>PowerMonger</i> takes the basic design and concepts of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Bullfrog\">Bullfrog</a>'s previous game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Populous\">Populous</a>, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.<br><br>The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progresses through the game.  Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.",
