The time is near for an All-Star Charity Game so Michael decides to go to the gym for some training. When he arrives, he finds out that his buddies' stuff is there but not his buddies. Suddenly a basketball flies in from nowhere with a note attached.<br><br>The note says something about a kidnapping and that Michael should visit a person in the Egyptian room in the city's museum. Michael has to descend into an underground prison and fight enemies with his basketball, which can be upgraded to a homing-ball, flame-ball, bounce-ball and other forms.",
