  "description": "The game is based on the popular manga series <i>Doraemon</i>. It tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who often gets beaten by other boys. Nobita's future grandson constructs a cat-like blue robot named Doraemon, and sends him to the past to protect Nobita. In this game, a friend of Nobita's finds a fossil. Accidentally, this fossil gets overrun by a car. Nobita feels it was his fault and asks Doraemon to use a time machine to travel back to prehistoric age to retrieve the fossil. <br><br><i>Doraemon 3: Nobita to Toki no H?gyoku</i> is an action platform game. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons. ",
