  "description": "<i>Super Bomberman: Panic Bomber World</i> is a puzzle game based on the popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Bomberman+series\"> Bomberman series</a>, which plays much like a cross between Bomberman and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a>. Groups of blocks will fall from the top of the screen. Match three identical blocks and bombs will drop from the top of the screen. Occasionally, a lit bomb will fall and explode, setting off any bombs it hits and causing a chain reaction. The game is over when blocks fill the screen.<br><br>It is essentially a variant of the console release of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bomberman-panic-bomber\"> Bomberman: Panic Bomber</a>, though without the time challenge mode and with several additions. Most of the stages play the same way as in the earlier version, but they now have real-world names (such as &quot;Jamaica&quot;), and dialogue between Bomberman and his opponents was added.<br><br>The game features a single-player story mode and a battle mode for up to four players.",
