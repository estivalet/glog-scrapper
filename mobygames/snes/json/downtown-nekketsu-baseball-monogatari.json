  "description": "Another sports title in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Nekketsu+High\">Nekketsu High</a> game series, this time featuring the Nekketsu guys go at each other's throat while playing baseball.<br><br>The game features a single play, Vs and Tournament/story mode. The gameplay itself  is similar to other baseball games in the sense that it subdivides the different stages of baseball (batting, pitching, running bases, etc.) in different &quot;mini games&quot; with their own camera angles and interfaces.<br><br>As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to &quot;bend&quot; the rules a bit, you can also use the &quot;ki&quot; or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.",
