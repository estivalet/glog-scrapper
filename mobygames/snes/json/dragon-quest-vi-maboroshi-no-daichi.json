  "description": "You and two of your friends decide to attack the Archenemy - the evil Mudo - in his castle. But as you reach his throne, he attacks you and send the three friends into three different places...<br><br>Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...<br><br><i>Dragon Quest VI</i> is the last Super Famicom/SNES game of the <i>Dragon Quest</i> series. It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from first person perspective. Gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout are very similar to those of the previous games in the series. The game utilizes an enhanced &quot;class system&quot; from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dragon+wariior+II\">third game</a>. Characters can choose different classes to belong to, and switch between them. The more a character fights while belonging to a certain class, the more proficient he/she becomes in it. Once two or three starting classes have been mastered, the character gains access to powerful hybrid classes, which grant the characters new abilities and various upgrades.",
