It keeps the same basic gameplay of the first title -- players move around the board purchasing properties and investing in districts to earn money -- while adding a number of new elements in the form of new space types, such as heliports that will move players to distant locations on the board. There are now more than a dozen characters to choose from, and 15 different board layouts, including several based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Dragon+Warrior+%2f+Dragon+Quest+series\">Dragon Quest</a> franchise.",
