  "description": "In F1ROC you drive in race car and compete in a series of sixteen races on tracks from around the world. You will earn money for each race depending on how you placed (for instance, first place nets you $7000) which you can use to purchase upgrades for your car. You need to find a good balance between the parts. To test the effectiveness of your parts you can run a test race to see how the car works before you buy. Data can be saved on the cartridge so you will not lose your parts or your race statistics. The goal is simply to complete all sixteen tracks; you will get a bonus at the end depending on how well you do so there is an incentive to play again and do better.",
