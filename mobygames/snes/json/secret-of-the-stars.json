  "description": "You are a young boy named Ray, who lives with his foster-father in a small country house on an island. But he can not enjoy his idyllic life for a long time. Ray is told about the evil wizard Homncruise, who plans to conquer the world. Defeating Homncruise won't be easy: first Ray must find the magic crest of his fallen father, and build a strong team of legendary warriors, named Aquitallion. Only then will he and his comrades be ready to face Homncruise and save the world.<br><br>In this game you wander around the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, much like in <i>Dragon Quest</i> games. You'll have two parties at your disposal, and will be able to switch between them at any time. One party is the Aquitallion, the &quot;main&quot; one, and the only one which can access plot-progressing areas. The other parties can be used for visiting dungeons and retrieving valuable items. At a certain point in the game, you'll also be able to build and manage your own town.",
