  "shortName": "evo-search-for-eden",
  "description": "The storyline of <i>E.V.O.: Search for Eden</i> follows the same patterns as modern Evolution theories. The players first controls a prehistoric sea organism, and fights to gain evolution points with which he can improve his fish's body parts and upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player's success.<br><br>The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.<br><br><i>E.V.O.: Search for Eden</i> is based on the Japan-only computer game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46-okunen-monogatari-the-shinkaron\"> 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinkaron</a>. While the basic premise of the game is the same, there are significant changes in gameplay and the layout of the game world.<br><br>In the computer release, the battles against other creatures were turn-based; here, the combat is real time, which effectively turns this version into an action RPG. The stages, while retaining similar themes, have a completely different layout. Side-scrolling view prevails over the original's top-down perspective. There are also boss battles that were absent in the original version.<br><br>Character building (&quot;evolution&quot;) is also different. Instead of distributing evolution points into four parameters, the player now basically &quot;buys&quot; upgrades, which have a fixed &quot;price&quot;. The player is able to acquire such upgrades for the creature's body parts (jaws, neck, body, etc.), raising their parameters and becoming stronger.<br><br>Story elements, friendly characters (NPCs), and quest-based structure that characterized the original game have been reduced and/or omitted in this release.",
