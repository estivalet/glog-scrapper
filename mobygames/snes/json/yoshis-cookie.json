  "description": "<i>Yoshi's Cookie</i> is a fast-paced puzzle game. The player moves randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When a row or column of the same cookies is successfully assembled, the line will disappear, and the player can begin to work on a new row or column. The &quot;Yoshi&quot; cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since this cookie is the key to both games, it should be used wisely.<br><br>The SNES version has an additional puzzle mode where players have to clear the game board in a limited number of moves. There are 100 unique puzzles in this mode.",
