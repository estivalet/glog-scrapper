  "description": "Sequel to the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Nazo+Puyo\">Super Nazo Puyo</a>, <i>Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanj?ki</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a> spin-off which combines arcade puzzle elements with RPG gameplay.<br><br>You play as the skilled martial artist Rulue as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded &quot;puyos&quot; are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fulfill the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.",
