  "description": "<i>Socks the Cat</i> is a new frontier in licensed games: presidential pets. Players take on the role of then-President of the United States Bill Clinton's pet cat Socks on a journey of great political importance. Robbers break into the White House and succeed in stealing a portable nuclear missile... and Socks. Players, as Socks, need to break themselves out while also recovering the nuclear missile to save the world.<br><br>Players control Socks from a side-scrolling perspective in a typical 2D platformer. Just like most other games in the genre, players can run and jump their way to victory. Being a cat, Socks can also use his claws - this is his main means of protection, with most enemies able to be taken down by a few strategic claw swipes. Players can also pick up a few other items to help them out, such as blocks of cheese that can be thrown to distract mouse enemies. A few levels feature real-world political themes, like the final level set in the White House's famous rose garden, but most feature generic platforming themes like warehouses or sewers. The political theme also shows up in a few bosses which are caricatures of real-world political figures.",
