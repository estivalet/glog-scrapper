  "description": "<i>Gon</i> is a side scrolling platform game based on the midget t-rex from the Japanese manga series with the same name.<br><br>The story is also told in a comic book fashion, without any actual text. Gon makes use of his head, teeth and tail to battle the hogs and rhinos that dare come in his way. There is also no life bar, the music just goes wild as Gon gets a massive hissy fit and eventually dies.",
