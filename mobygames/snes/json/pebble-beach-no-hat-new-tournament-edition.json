  "description": "The final golf game for SNES from T&amp;E Soft. The cartridge contains the SA-1 enhancement chip, so there are less waits during gameplay, graphics are also improved. In previous work, the terrain that had been drawn as flat polygon became a more of a pointillist style painting. There were many interface improvements and the main controls moved from a window to being displayed around the player sprite.",
