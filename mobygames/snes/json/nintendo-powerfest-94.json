  "description": "In 1994, Nintendo once again held a video game competition. This time, the event went to 132 towns to determine one winner per town. These town winners were then flown to San Diego, California in the USA. They were then divided into four teams of thirty-three players each. The winning team of this group would then play each other to determine who were the best two players. Those final two winners then played a modified cartridge of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/donkey-kong-country\">Donkey Kong Country</a> to determine the ultimate winner of the competition.<br><br>During the competition, the players played a special SNES cartridge. On this cartridge, they had to complete the first level of the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Super+Mario+Bros%2e%3a+The+Lost+Levels\">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-all-stars\">Super Mario All-Stars</a> version, complete five laps in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/super-mario-kart\">Super Mario Kart</a> and hit as many long home runs as they could in the home run derby from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496830281\">Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball</a>.",
