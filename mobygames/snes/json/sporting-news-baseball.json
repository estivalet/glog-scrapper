  "description": "<i>The Sporting News Baseball</i> doesn't feature a Major League license, but does feature the MLBPA license, meaning that it features some of the best players of the time, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,562806/\">Ken Griffey Jr.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Daryl+Strawberry\">Daryl Strawberry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=John+Smoltz\">John Smoltz</a>, to name a few. There are only three stadiums to pick from; two are generic but the other is the baseball field from the movie Field of Dreams.<br><br>There are several modes such as exhibition games, All-Star Game, the Home Run Derby, and a pennant race. The gameplay is similar to other baseball games, certain buttons to swing the bat and bunting or selecting pitches.",
