  "description": "In this sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Putty%27\">Putty</a>, the Wizard's peoples have invaded Putty land, and it's up to you to head to the Wizard city of Klud and free your many POWs. The gameplay has less of a puzzle element than the original, and is more of a standard platform game - to whatever extent a game in which you can become an all-conquering Terminator Putty, must face pups throwing grenades at you, and can use Uncle Ted to play a tune to distract enemies can be seen as a 'standard' example of anything.<br><br>You take control of the same amorphous blob as before, which has the ability to 'stretch' left and right (using this as a weapon which kills on contact) and to stretch upwards to make jumping easier. He can also explode himself and absorb other objects, even becoming them physically to gain an advantage.<br><br>There are stars littered around the level, and collecting these upgrades Putty's abilities, starting with a super punch for 10 stars, going up to the Terminator ability for 40. <br><br>The pups from the previous game are no longer on your side, and are out to get you. These have all manner of abilities - shooting mortar bombs at you, paradropping towards you, and even flying a helicopter.",
