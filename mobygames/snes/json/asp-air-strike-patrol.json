  "name": "A.S.P.: Air Strike Patrol",
  "shortName": "asp-air-strike-patrol",
  "description": "Playing as a jet pilot of the &quot;Coalition&quot; force, players take control of either an F-15 Eagle, or an A-10 Tankbuster jet. The mission is to neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring country. The Zarak army has many ground units, including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD missiles and armored vehicles.<br><br>To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the Zarak army, players venture out on numerous missions (called &quot;sorties&quot;) that have varied and specific objectives. Typically, various installations such as radar sites, air bases or ground units are the target. Other missions include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying SCUD launchers before they fire. <br><br>Pre-mission screens ask the player to select from the two planes. Then,  the player can specify the armament to carry into the sortie. Air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles are available for each of the planes. Here, a strategic choice between countering either air units or ground units has to be made, as each area (of which there are eight) is patrolled by opposing enemy F-15 jets.<br><br>The game is played through the isometric-perspective, and the plane's speed and direction can be be adjusted in real-time. Altitude however, is fixed. A missile/bomb-target is constantly shown on the ground before the plane, allowing players to aim at units, or, with the F-15, a lock-on targeting system is available.<br><br>The game also makes use of a briefing before each mission, and also a further briefing by an animated colonel on the tarmac just before take-off. Various debriefing screens are shown also, and, if the player attains a certain strike rate, a &quot;GNN&quot; news story may play out. For each mission, a time-limit and minimum destruction-rate must be met. You can take-off as often as need be to attain this.",
