The player controls a crosshair and has to shoot increasingly difficult enemies.\n<li>Whack a Clown: This game is exclusive to the Genesis Version and plays like 'Whac-a-Mole' only with clowns instead of moles.\n</ul><br>\n<li><b>Music</b><br>\nSongs can be composed by choosing from several instruments and putting notes onto a stave. It is also possible to add sound effects (animal noises and others) or edit provided songs.<br><br><li><b>Style</b><br>\nThis section contains two mini-games:\n<ul><li>Stylin' Stuff: Here, the player can edit the sprite of a woman by selecting different clothes, hats or haircuts.\n<li>Mix 'n match: Sprites can be created by putting together different heads, torso, and legs.\n</ul></ul>",
