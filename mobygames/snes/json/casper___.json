  "description": "You are Kat Harvey, the daughter of a paranormal expert. You've just met a friendly ghost named Casper, and you're getting to like him. But a pair of government agents are hot on both your tails! And if they catch you, who knows what they'll do to ghosts like him? You can't dwell on this much longer - you've got to protect him, and quick!<br><br>Based on the movie of the same name, &quot;Casper&quot; has you as Kat collecting items (especially coins and gems) while trying to protect your namesake ghostly friend from the wrath of government agents. Kat can use baseballs to stun the agents for a while, but she better use them wisely or she'll get caught ending the game. Luckily Kat can save the game at any time by activating a series of mechanical contraptions. Saving the game keeps track of the coins and gems Kat has collected, and that total determines how much of the game you have completed. Kat can also call on Casper to see through walls and locked doors and see what lies ahead, but he can only do this for a brief time before control returns to Kat.",
