  "description": "It all started when an prison inmate named Joe Yabuki got into a fight with his rival and former boxing prodigy Rikiishi. Rikiishi was dominating Joe until it happened - Joe hit him with a cross-counter, knocking them both out! That's when the inmates knew that this young man was going to be someone special. After taking some lessons from a boxing trainer named Danpei (who he met before), and some time apart in the process, Joe was finally ready for the boxing world. But is the boxing world ready for Joe?<br><br>Based on the critically-acclaimed Japanese manga of the same name, <i>Ashita no Joe</i> puts the player in Joe Yabuki's shoes as he battles some of his greatest opponents. Like many other boxing games of its time, the controls are simple - use one button to punch, and the other to guard. Knock him down three times, and he's down for the count. But always be on guard, because the fighters that await Joe as he climbs the ladder to Bantamweight boxing glory can get tougher and meaner!<br><br>A second player can join in the melee, playing a VS mode.",
