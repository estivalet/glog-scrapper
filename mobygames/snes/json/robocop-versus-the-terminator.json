  "description": "In the future, human soldiers of John Connor's resistance force against the machines are fighting a losing war against Skynet and its robot forces. After discovering that one of the foundation technologies for Skynet is the cybernetics technology used in the creation of Robocop, one of the resistance's soldiers, Flo, is sent back in time before the rise of the machines to destroy Robocop and stop Skynet from being built. However Skynet learns of the time travel attempt and sends Terminators to stop Flo.<br><br>In the game you control Robocop who may move across the screen, jump, fire and exchange weapons. Robocop starts with the Auto-9 which has unlimited ammunition. Other weapons may be more powerful but contain limited ammo. Beginning the game on a mission of law enforcement, you soon meet up with Flo and must engage in battle against Terminators, the forces of OCP and several obstacles.",
