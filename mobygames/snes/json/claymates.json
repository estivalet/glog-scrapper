  "description": "From the creators of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/clay-fighter\">Clay Fighter</a> comes a game about a shape-shifting ball of clay.  You play as a boy named Clayton, whose father has developed a serum to turn humans into animals.  However, an evil shaman desires this serum, and when he is denied ownership of it, he kidnaps Clayton's father and turns Clayton into a ball of clay.  It's up to the unlikely hero to rescue his father, the serum, and the world!<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling platformer where you gain power-ups that let you transform into various forms to help you reach the end of the level.  After each level, you are placed on the world map and given several robots who blindly walk forward until they hit an obstacle, then turn at a right angle and continue on their way.  It's up to you to manipulate them to help you clear a way to the next level, where more challenges await.",
