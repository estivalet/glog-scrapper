  "description": "The Garkos Gorgons have challenged the Hurricanes to a charity soccer match to see which team is the best in the world. \nThe game follows the traversals of the Hurricanes, from their homeland to the Gorgons's stadium located on the \nfar away Garkos Island. The Hurricanes must arrive at the foreign stadium on time or the Gorgons will automatically win the match.<br><br>The game consists of 15 levels that each must be completed within a certain time limit. Players control either Cal Casey  or Napper Thompson. They go throughout each stage dribbling a soccer ball.\nThe ball can be used as a makeshift weapon as it can be kicked at enemies and also can be used to open boxes scattered throughout each level.\nThe crates contain items like medals and trophies that can be collected. Those collected items get totaled at the end of each stage and get added as bonus points to the players score.<br><br>The game features an easy, medium, and hard difficulty level option.",
