  "description": "The second game in the series released for the Super Famicom, unlike the first game, now shows the Street Fighter style, with only 10 selectable characters. <br><br>The game is still based on the story of the manga, and presents the story until the middle of it (the final fight against Toguro Ani). At first you can hardly give the special moves, but after the third fight you may have gained knowledge to do it.<br><br>Note that when you are low on energy, the blue bar will flash. At this point you can now drop the special moves.\nThe game features four modes: Story Mode, Tournament Mode, Versus Mode, and a Training Mode, to learn the special moves, using the command sequence.",
