  "description": "Lady is a girl from a good family. However, she doesn't care much for good manners and diligent study, but thinks only about faraway lands and treasure. Wherever she appears, destruction follows. Lady's parents, afraid of their daughter's hyperactive nature, locked her in a mansion guarded by two loyal servants: the gardener Yoshio and the cook Cox. One day, Lady finds a book about Deathland Island, where a great treasure is supposedly hidden. She escapes the mansion, arrives at Deathland Island, and learns its was once ruled by a mad scientist King Baron, who made experiments on monsters. Lady decides to explore Baron's castle and the rest of the island, to find a way to get to the legendary treasure.<br><br><i>Lady Stalker</i> is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements, closely connected to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/landstalker-treasure-of-king-nole\">Landstalker</a>. The player explores dungeons and other locations, most of which are full of various puzzles. Lady cannot jump, but instead dashes to cross small pits. Regular battle encounters are random. Once Lady enters a battle, she must defeat her foes in action-style combat before being able to continue exploration. Later in the game other characters fight alongside her. Those characters are controlled by the AI, but the player can pause the battle at any time and assign commands to them. ",
