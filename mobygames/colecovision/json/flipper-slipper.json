  "description": "<h3>Back of Box - ColecoVision (US) (from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/flipper-slipper/adblurbs\">Ad Blurbs</a>)</h3>Welcome to video pinball, a super-slick, fun-filled version of the traditional game. The action is controlled not by fixed flippers but by moving and maneuverable flippers! You're going to need all the skill and technique you can muster, because there's going to be more super-fast action slipping past your flippers than you can handle: tree forests to snare your ball; a target fence that requires pinpoint control; a moving bumper that quirks your ball's carom; beaches that change the color of your ball so that you have to color-coordinate with your flippers. And, finally, a dam that bursts and floods the field of action, ending the game.<br><br>FLIPPER SLIPPER HAS:\n<ul><li>4 DIFFICULTY LEVELS FOR 1 OR 2 PLAYERS</li>\n<li>FAST OR SLOW BALL ACTION</li>\n<li>MOVING AND MANEUVERABLE FLIPPERS</li>\n<li>MORE SKILL, MORE TECHNIQUE AND MORE FUN!</li></ul><br><br>USE WITH COLECO KEYPAD CONTROLLER",
