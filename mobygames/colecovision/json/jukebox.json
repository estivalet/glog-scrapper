  "description": "<h3>Back of Box - ColecoVision (US) (from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jukebox/adblurbs\">Ad Blurbs</a>)</h3>JUKEBOX is a musical strategy game that's kind of a cross between a chess match and a dance contest.<br><br>During the game the JUKEBOX is jumpin' with lots of terrific songs. Songs so good you never want them to stop. But to keep the music playing you've got to create gold records.<br><br>Using your dancing feet and your natural sense of rhythm you jump from square to square creating hit records as you go. Aim for the pulsating gold tiles, because you can build them into records. And the more gold records you get the more coins you earn. Use the coins to keep the music bopping and the game from stopping.<br><br>Play against the computer or another player. But plan your strategy carefully because in JUKEBOX you can box yourself in – and then the music's over.<br><br>JUKEBOX includes an activities booklet that traces the history of music, shows you how to play a jug, make your own 3-D glasses and use your touch tone phone to create your own music.<br><br><b>Joyce Hakansson Associates,</b> creator of JUKEBOX, is a team of artists, writers, educators, and programmers working together to create innovative software for children.<br><br><b>Educational Value: JUKEBOX sharpens your ability to predict outcomes and plan strategies while challenging your memory and concentration skills. Ages 8-Adult.</b>",
