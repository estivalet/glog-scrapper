  "description": "A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a> clone for the ColecoVision, <i>Strike It!</i> features six scenes in which the player must use a paddle to break all bricks and hit all animals in order to advance to the next scene.<br><br>Bricks are worth anywhere from 30-80 points, depending on their color, while animals hit are worth either 300 or 500 points. Most scenes also feature a second ball surrounded by bricks, and when freed, the ball enters play as another brick-breaker, though letting it fall past the paddle will also cost the player a life.<br><br>The game includes four difficulty levels and support for one, two, or four players, including both alternating and simultaneous options for the two-player modes.",
