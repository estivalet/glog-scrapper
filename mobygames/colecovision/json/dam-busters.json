  "description": "<i>Dam Busters</i> is an early flight simulation, set in World War II. It focuses on Dam Busters who historically were used to heavily bombard strategic objectives, in this case dams.<br><br>This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.<br><br>When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!",
