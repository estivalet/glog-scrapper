  "description": "<i>Looping</i> is an arcade action game for one or two players. Your goal is to guide a plane from the runway to a docking station. To do this, there are several screens you need to get past. In the first area, you need to destroy a rocket which will open the gate to the next area. Enemy balloons and city terrain all get in your way! Once you've opened the gate and flown through, you will enter a maze made of pipes. There are no enemies trying to destroy you here, but be careful not to crash into the walls! Bonus points can be earned by staying in the maze for longer periods of time or by flying faster. Once you near the end of the pipe maze, the docking station will be in sight. There will now be several twinkle monsters, green drops, and bouncing balls in the way, all of which destroy your plane on contact. If you successfully reach the goal, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.",
