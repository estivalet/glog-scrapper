  "description": "<i>Skiing</i> is a basic representation of the alpine sport's downhill and slalom events for the ColecoVision.<br><br>Featuring support for 1-4 players, the game features three levels of difficulty as players compete to complete the courses in the shortest amount of time. Hitting objects such as trees will cause skiers to fall and be stunned for a few seconds. In the slalom, five-second time penalties are assessed for each missed gate, while in downhill, skiers must negotiate between moguls.",
