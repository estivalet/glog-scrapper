  "description": "In <i>Astrododge</i>, the player controls a spaceship trying to avoid asteroids as the screen scrolls vertically for as long as possible. The ship is equipped with no weapons at all, and the player has only one life. At every 100 points, words of encouragement are spoken (for consoles equipped with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?attribute=The+Voice\">The Voice</a> module only).<br><br>The game also features a secret hidden gameplay mode, internet highscore uploading and an online rewards system. To upload the highscore, players receive a code which must be entered at the developer's website. The online rewards work the same way, and there are four of them:\n<ul>\n\t<li>[silver] Mad Skills - Score 1000 points</li>\n\t<li>[silver] I'm not an addict - Play Astrododge 50 times in one session </li>\n\t<li>[bronze] Detective - Discover secret gamemode </li>\n\t<li>[gold] Big dog! - Score 1000 points in secret mode</li>\n</ul>",
