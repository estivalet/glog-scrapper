  "description": "<i>Amazing Snake</i> is a homebrew action game similar to early 1980s games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snake-byte\">Snake Byte</a> and <a id=\"d851c0f04bdd6eeacc2ceddc73f26ef62\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Nibbler\">Nibbler</a>. You guide a snake through 20 screens, trying to eat all of the apples while avoiding crashing into the border, the maze barriers, and yourself. Complicating matters is the fact that every time you eat an apple, your snake grows a new segment, making it more and more difficult to avoid crashing into yourself.",
