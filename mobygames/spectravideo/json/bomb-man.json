  "description": "In <i>Bomb Man</i>, which has no relation to Hudson's famous <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/bomberman____\">Bomberman</a></i>, you play as a hat-clad yellow man who must disarm the bombs placed on the screen by a green man. The green man hunts you as you go around the screen, and if you don't move in a careful fashion, he will corner you. Bushes may slow down the green man's steps. Sometimes, the green man will tire, and you will have a bonus screen where you can go about disarming bombs at your own pace.",
