  "description": "Larv is Swedish for larva, and as the name suggests, it's a &quot;snake&quot; game. Steer your larva, growing as it is eating dots, without colliding with yourself or the walls. The larva grows for each fifth dot it eats, and once it reaches 100 segments, it starts off in a new labyrinth. Colliding doesn't instantly kill the larva, only giving it a concussion, costing it a brain cell. <br><br>The game can be played by one or two players. In the competitive two player mode, the objective is to make the opposing player collide.<br><br>There are several settings, such as the density of the labyrinth, the growth rate and the screen colours.",
