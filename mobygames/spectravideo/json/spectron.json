The player controls a Spectron fighter, a land-based vehicle that can fire high speed rockets. The player is protected by a shield that consists of various segments above the player. Each segment can be destroyed by enemy fire when hit often enough, but the player cannot shoot through it. Invaders will appear at the top of the screen and must be destroyed. Some invaders can plant bombs in the city backdrop. When more than nine bombs have been planted the game ends immediately, irregardless of the remaining lives of the player. Alien forces are brought in by a transport ship, if the player manages to destroy it it'll destroy up to eighteen ships at once.
