  "description": "Though the title may sound like a card game, this <i>Solitaire</i> is an elimination board game. On a cross-shaped playfield filled with X'es, you must move a cursor so that it is next to an X, then press the space key to jump across it. However, the cursor must land in an empty square. By doing so, that X is eliminated, and the game is clear once only one X remains, preferably in the middle of the screen.",
