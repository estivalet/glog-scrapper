  "description": "<i>Diamond Luis</i> is a small <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a></i> clone, perhaps the only one for the Spectravideo system. Graphically, it is very reminiscent of the original, but it does away with the scrolling. The puzzle aspect, keeping in mind in what order rocks should be undermined, has at least as much emphasis as in the original game. For example, there are moving blocks which will hunt you down if they escape, and must be destroyed by dropping a rock on them. If they are destroyed, they explode, thereby opening brick walls where diamonds are confined, so that you may exit the level after having collected enough gems.",
