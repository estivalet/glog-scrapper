  "description": "You must cross the graveyard late at night, but amongst the labyrinthine tombstones are ghosts that may scare you to death. In order to reach the exit, you must avoid the ghosts or keep them away by digging holes. At the easy difficulty level, ghosts may fall into the holes; at high difficulty, they merely stop. Though it may be tempting to dig a ring of holes around you to keep the ghosts at bay, you must hurry so that you reach the exit before the clock strikes twelve.",
