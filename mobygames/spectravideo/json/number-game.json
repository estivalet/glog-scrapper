The object for both the computer and the player is to score as many points as possible. The game will show a list of numbers. The player may pick any number from the list and receive points equal to the number. The computer may then however pick out all numbers from the list which are factors from the number chosen by the player. This equals his score. The player must try to find numbers which are prime numbers or have only few factors in order to win the computer.",
