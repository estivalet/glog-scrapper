  "description": "Conversely to the title, <i>Ballbounce</i> doesn't involve bouncing a ball, but simply rolling it, which is far from easy. In a vein similar to, but not obviously inspired by <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marble-madness\">Marble Madness</a></i>, you must guide a ball toward its goal on a pseudo-3D-projected screen. The ball's inertia, in combination with the many platform edges to roll off, makes for a challenging game. All action takes place on one screen without scrolling, and you must reach the goal before time runs out, or your opponent does it before you.",
