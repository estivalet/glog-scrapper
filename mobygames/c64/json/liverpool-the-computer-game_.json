  "description": "Arc Developments converted their football game to the Commodore 64 using a top-down view very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kick+Off\">Kick Off</a>. Options are otherwise virtually identical, with cup and full season options over a variable match length, although player profiles feature basic statistics instead of textual information, and you can play shorter matches than in the 16-bit version. Gameplay is also very similar, with one-touch passing and fairly close ball control, although the control of free kicks is less precise in this version.",
