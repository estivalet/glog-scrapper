  "description": "<i>Dive</i> has the player in control of a team of divers with the goal to recover treasures from the bottom of the ocean. The player controls a single diver at a time and must get to the bottom to collect treasure as quickly as possible since each minute underwater uses up precious air. Hungry starks patrol the waters and must be avoided at all cost. Different difficulty levels determine the amount of air available to the player. The crew size is the number of lives (quite literally) that the player has.",
