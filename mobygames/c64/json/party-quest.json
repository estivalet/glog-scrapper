  "description": "In this game, the player has to get rid of hippies who are having a party in the house, and destroying everything in the process. It is a joystick-controlled adventure game split into three sections. A picture is located on the left side of the screen, and a choice of actions to take on the right. A description is underneath each of these elements, and has commands including pick up, give, talk to, look at, fight, and go to another part of the house. The player can also bring up a map of the house and check their inventory. The action marked with a question mark will bring up a list of valid directions in which the player can go. Talking to characters will often bring up a list of responses that the player must select in order to proceed through the game. \n",
