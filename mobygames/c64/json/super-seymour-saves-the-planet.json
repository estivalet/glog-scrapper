  "description": "In the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/seymour-goes-to-hollywood\">Seymour Goes to Hollywood</a>, Seymour takes on his first movie role - as an eco-friendly superhero. With game design showing some obvious influence from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bomb+Jack\">Bomb Jack</a>, Seymour jumps around a series of single screen areas collecting barrels of toxic waste. One barrel at a time is highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from above, some must be hit from below.",
