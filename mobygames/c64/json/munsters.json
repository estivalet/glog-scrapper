  "description": "The characters from the 60s TV series <i>The Munsters</i> have been transported away to a mysterious castle. Playing as different members of the family in succession, the player must rescue them. As you walk through each room, you must collect items to help you deal with each challenge. You must build up your spell power by shooting ghouls, zombies and vampires, as this allows you to deal with other challenges. Avoid contact with those monsters, as they will zap your energy and finally kill you - you have a single life.",
