  "description": "<i>Jungle Trouble</i> is a platform game restricted to a single scenario that takes place in a jungle environment. To conquer the game the player has to get home. But to achieve that he has to travel from the lower right corner to the upper left corner of the screen overcoming several obstacles that will be put on his way. By their level of difficulty these obstacles may be compared to independent levels composed inside a single scenario. The number of lives the player has is represented at the lower right corner and at the left corner, the existent great apes which will torment him during great part of the game.<br><br>Firstly, the player will have to cross a series of platforms without getting in the water either loosing his axe or being attacked by a member of the order <i>Crocodilia</i>. This axe can be acquired at the start when the player leans himself against the right wall of the screen.<br><br>Only after being successful transporting the axe from one end to the other of the series of platforms, the player will have to manage its use while he knocks the trees down or defends himself against the great ape's attack. Because at the first opportunity they will try to steal it from him and the axe will become permanently more damaged by its use. When this happens the player has to be very cautions because he's now helpless without any kind of weapon do defend himself or attack, and he'll become an easy prey for the apes. Therefore, the process of acquiring an axe has to be repeated.<br><br>As for the last two obstacles, the player has to firmly pick a liana and safely jump to the other side of a pool of fire. Immediately after, he has to take a big leap by jumping between the extremes of the opening platform which will continually do so until it becomes too wide for any kind of jump. When he succeeds he may calmly touch the upper left wall and finally reach home safe and sound.",
