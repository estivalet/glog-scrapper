  "description": "<i>Pod</i> is a side-view scrolling game where the screen scrolls from left to right when you move as you control Pod whose quest is to retrieve the Magic Orb. A Dragon has attacked the village hall and taken the orb which leaves the village defenceless and because your Grandfather brought the orb to the village, you have been asked to get it back. Pod must leave the village and move through the woodland avoiding creatures and obstacles while collecting diamonds. Pod can't actually walk though, he can only jump forwards but he can jump great distances if needed. Just pressing up or down moves Pod a small distance, but if up and down are waggled together then a jump gauge increases and when stopped or the gauge is full then Pod will jump a greater distance. Creatures encountered are birds and giants with huge clubs and if touched then a magic gauge decreases and when it is empty then Pod loses one of three lives. Obstacles like fences and water though kill Pod instantly when touched.",
