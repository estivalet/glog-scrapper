  "description": "<i>Bug Squad</i> is a single screen shooter based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/centipede_\">Centipede</a> where you are a 'Zappo' squirtomatic all-purpose garden controller and you must destroy a centipede type creature to complete each level. You control the Zappo at the bottom of the screen and you move left or right, as well as moving forwards and backwards a short distance firing upwards. The Centipede appears at the top of the screen moving across the screen from one side to the other and when it hits a piece of grass or the edge of the screen it moves downwards and moves the opposite way. <br><br>If the centipede is shot by you then it splits into two and each part splits into two each time it is shot. Also on screen is lots of grass which re-directs the centipede and can be removed after a couple of shots for extra points. As well as the grass there is a magnet, lawnmower and a flying bottle and when these are shot then they leave behind more grass with the lawnmower leaving poisonous grass. if you are hit by any of these as well as the centipede then you lose one of three lives and when the centipede is removed then it is on to the next level to face another one.",
