  "description": "An old-fashioned football management game, in which you take over one of 64 clubs and try to lead them to glory. The choice is fairly arbitrary, as you can rename the team, you always start in the lowest of the four divisions, and the kits aren't real-life.<br><br>You start with only 11 players, and the maximum is 15, so you'll be keen to sign new players, and you get this opportunity after each match, when a player is offered, with his skill and form displayed. You can train your players to improve these skills, and sell players you don't rate highly.<br><br>Matches are played out via a succession of short animations, in which the home side wears red and the away side blue. At full time you are told how many injuries were incurred. The league season features 15 matches, one against each team, with the top two teams gaining promotion.",
