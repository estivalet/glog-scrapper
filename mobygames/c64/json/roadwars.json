  "description": "In Road Wars you are set charging up a long hilly road, trying to make a road safe after a protection malfunction. Crucially, this involves shooting out the barriers at the side of the road (and avoiding falling into the gaps they create). You always play against another droid, who can be treated as friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat trick, especially when playing a human opponent.<br><br>You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.",
