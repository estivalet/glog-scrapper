  "description": "This game from 1987 is based on the adventures of the French comic book character Iznogoud.   You are in the role of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud, whose only thought is to depose the Caliph of magical Baghdad and become &quot;Caliph instead of the Caliph!&quot;  To accomplish this aim, you must wander around and interact with characters around you, acquiring objects along the way that may or may not be useful, and figure out how all this will help you achieve your goal.<br><br>During the game, you have 4 different methods of interacting with other characters: you can give objects to them, you can threaten them, you can flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum.  Depending on the character, these actions will elicit different responses--or none altogether.  You will need objects for various things, and objects are all acquired from other characters.  Some characters are helpful, others are not.  But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace.  Just be careful not to lose your own head in the process!",
