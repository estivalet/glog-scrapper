  "description": "<i>Humpty Dumpty &amp; Cock Robin</i> is a collection of two educational programs for the ages 7 - 10 years old, where you have to guess who pushed Humpty Dumpty off the wall (two games) and who killed Cock Robin (one game) by process of elimination. The two programs contain:<br><br><b>Humpty Dumpty Mystery</b><br><br>Game One: You have a line-up of twelve of the Kings men, each individual but sharing some of the same colours and face with some of the other men which are hat colour, badge colour, eye colour, jacket colour and if he has a moustache. You must ask a question by one key press or typing in the words like 'Does he have green eyes'. If you are right then all non-green eyes are removed, if wrong then all green eyes are removed. The aim is to guess in as few questions as you can.<br><br>Game Two: You are shown the culprit for a few seconds before being shown a plain man. You then have to pick the various colours of the man you think did it before being shown the culprit again and you see if you are right or wrong. Both games have two difficulties and they are Easier or More Difficult.<br><br><b>Cock Robin</b><br><br>Cock Robin has been killed and you have to find out the animal, location and time by a selection of choices which you can select the amount of choices from three to six. You are first asked which animal you think did it, where the murder took place and finally the time. You are then told how many you have got right before you can select one clue for a category. Your aim is to guess the details of the murder in as few guesses as possible.<br><br>",
