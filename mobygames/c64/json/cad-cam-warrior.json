  "description": "CADCAM (Computer Aided Design Computer Aided Manufacture) is a new processing unit that is dedicated to human needs and is being unveiled at the 25th Cadcam International Show for the first time in front of the public and potential buyers. Problem is the main memory bank on plate 8192 has gone down and with time running out before the show it needs fixing. To make matters worse the security defences on each plate need removing to reach the Memory Bank and fix CADCAM so a mini-android called MAD 2 has been sent in to fix the problem and save the day.<br><br><i>Cad Cam Warrior</i> is a single screen game where each screen is made up of a plate viewed from an elevated angle with each plate split into two with one the right way up and the other upside down. You control MAD 2 and you must remove all the defences on the screen by moving around the screen and shooting them all on both sides of the plate connected by holes. As you shoot there are various items that can be collected to use later on in the game. Once a plate has been cleared then you have a small map showing the available routes you can take as you attempt to get to plate 8192. If you are touched by any of the defences then you lose one of five lives.",
