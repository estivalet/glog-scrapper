  "description": "This is the sequel to the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Daredevil+Denis\">Daredevil Denis</a> for the Electron/BBC Micro. After the events of the first game Denis won an Oscar for Worst Stuntman in a BBC Program. He is soon fired from his job however and to add insult to injury his cousin Decidedly Daft Douglas steals his Oscar. He leaves a note that if Denis wants his statue back, they will need to meet inside a Commodore 64. Once there, Denis discovers that Douglas has set up a film studio with all the old props and actors. Denis needs to go through the movies once again to retrieve the statue.<br><br>Compared to the first game the setting is largely identical but the gameplay is very different. In order to reach the studio Denis first enters a section where he has to walk to collect balloons and jump over flowers to score points. Once the distance has been bridged he enters the film studio. The studio is split up into eight scenes that each hold pieces of the Oscar. At that point the game returns to the original setting where Denis needs to drive a bike over platforms and avoid enemies and hazards. He can drive left or right and jump. The goal is not to reach the bottom right corner of the scene however, but to collect all pieces of the Oscar that drop with balloons. There are trampolines to return to a higher area. Each collected piece builds up the statue in the top left corner. Once all of them have been collected, Denis moves on to the next scene. It is possible to become indestructible for a while by activating Porridge Power, but there is only a small quantity. Once all scenes have been completed Denis needs to walk to a next studio with harder gameplay.<br><br>Just like the original game there are six difficulty levels. Denis has five takes (lives) to complete all scenes before the game is over. By completing a studio a new take is granted.",
