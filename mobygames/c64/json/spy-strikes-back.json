  "description": "After your exploits in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/spys-demise\">Spy's Demise</a>, you have been assigned a desk job to rest and recuperate.  Things are slow until you get a call from the Chief, who tells you that the international terrorist Dr. Xavier Tortion is up to no good.  It is your job to infiltrate his hideout in the East German town of Aichenbach, and find the 9 clues scattered about the fortress to defeat Dr. Xavier's plans.<br><br>The fortress consists of 5 floors.  Each floor has 24 sections divided into a 6 x 4 grid.  Each individual section has 16 rooms divided into a 4 x 4 formation.  Patrolling the hallways are Dr. Xavier's security robots.  If the player get too close to these robots, they will flash red and attempt to hunt down the player causing a loss of a life.  The player is safe while hiding inside rooms, but is at risk of being attacked while in the hallways.  The player starts with 3 lives and gets an extra life every 2000 points.  If the player finds all 9 clues, it's game over for Dr. Xavier.  ",
