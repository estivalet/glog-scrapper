  "description": "Radarsoft created the educational program <i>Maps Britain</i> for the British market and it teaches people in the UK the geography of their own country.<br><br>There are three options to choose from, which are Search, Quiz and Heligame. In the Search mode the player can type in any cities, counties, seas etc. and the game will automatically go to the right place on the map. In the Quiz mode the player can choose from; large cities, cities, islands/countries or water/areas and needs to name them that has been pointed out by the computer in a certain time. In the heligame player can first change the start level from 1 (easy) to 4 (difficult) and then controls a helicopter and must fly within a certain time limit to find the places indicated by the computer. Each place that has been found provides points.",
