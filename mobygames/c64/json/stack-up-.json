  "description": "A good alternate title for this one would be Rows - not the kind you have when your wife finds lipstick on your shirt collar, but as an equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Columns\">Columns</a>. The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically.<br><br>Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tetris\">Tetris</a>. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/klax\">Klax</a>. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).",
