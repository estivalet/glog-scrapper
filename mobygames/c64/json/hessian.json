  "description": "Odd things are going on at the Throne Group Science Complex.  Kim, a lowly security guard, wakes up on a makeshift operating table - dimly recalling a sudden attack that had plunged the place into chaos.  Apparently, shadowy experiments in robotics and nanotech have backfired horribly as the megalomaniac scientists' creations turned on them.  She emerges, only to see a survivor being gunned down by a rogue drone; in his last words, he manages to impart enough information for her to go seek out the others still in hiding, and attempt to find out what's going on.<br><br><em>Hessian</em> is a side-scrolling action/adventure game in the same mold as the author's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Metal+Warrior+series\">Metal Warrior</a> series.  As Kim investigates the vast science complex, she'll need all her combat skills to take on her enemies, both machine and human.  As part of the emergency procedure that saved Kim's life, her system had been boosted by a nanobot injection: in addition to enhancing her physical capabilities, this lets her regenerate her health - however, the tiny biomachines need a constant supply of battery power to remain functional.  Various objects, weapons and nanotech upgrades may be found, picked up and used; progress is gained through exploration, communication with NPCs, and poking through the computer logs and other clues scattered throughout the compound.<br><br>There are four skill levels to choose from (which determine how much damage is sustained in combat), and five save slots to retain your progress.  Should you die in action, there's also the &quot;retry&quot; option which starts you off from the last room entered.",
