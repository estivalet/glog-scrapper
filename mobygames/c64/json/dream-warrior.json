  "description": "In the future, the world is controlled by corporations rather than governments, and wars are fought in a dream world rather than in reality.  The corporations can control dream demons to defeat their foes, but resistance fighters still defy them.  The player is one of these resistance fighters hoping to rescue some friends from the control of Ocular, the mightiest of all dream demons.<br><br>Gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xenophobe\">Xenophobe</a>, with the player moving through side-scrolling, space-station-like environments shooting at an endless onslaught of strange creatures.  By making good use of power-ups and gaining access to new levels, the player can eventually find Ocular, which can only be defeated if all six of its eyes are shot closed.",
