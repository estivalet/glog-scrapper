  "description": "Kormath has stolen The Holy Grail and Excalibur from Merlin and Merlin has promised a great reward for anyone who can go to Kormath's dungeon underneath <i>The Standing Stones</i> and retrieve his items. You are a Knight and you have decided to go dungeon exploring and treasure hunting for Merlin. Lancelot will come along but can only help occasionally.<br><br><i>The Standing Stones</i> is a 3D maze game with small elements of RPG and has you viewing the dungeon and surrounding areas from a 1st person perspective. Before you start your exploration you are given random values to five traits, Virility, Intellect, Holiness, Agility and Initial Hits. If you don't like these values then you can get another set of random values. After entering your name it's time to start your adventure. Using the keyboard you can move around the dungeon in stages and turn 90 degrees. <br><br>You will encounter treasure and chests and these can be opened, ignored or opened carefully. Scattered around the dungeon are Kormath's minions and you can either bribe, greet or fight them if you can't evade them. Combat is just random with no skill, just luck on your side. Lancelot will appear occasionally to aid you. You are able to use magic and potions and these are also scattered around the dungeon to be found and you can rest and drop objects you don't require. You only have one life but you have the ability to save your game. The Dungeon Master option is just Disk cleaning.",
