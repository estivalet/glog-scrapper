  "description": "In <i>Guns 'n' Ghosts</i>, the player takes the role of the ghost hunters Trev and Georg. The goal is to gun down as many supernatural foes, e.g. demons and skeletons, as possible for a high score. There are 72 one-screen levels with numerous platforms to jump on - obviously it is a bad idea to touch enemies. Both player characters play differently: Georg has a shotgun which needs to reloaded regularly and has a long range while Trev has an unlimited psychic attack with short range. Trev's attack is beam-like.<br><br>Killed enemies may drop power ups which reward advantages when picked up: more ammo capacity for Georg's shotgun, instant kill shots, more attack power for Trev, weapon speed up, an extra life or temporary invincibility. Players can also fight together in co-op; including the option to play with two Trev or two Georg characters. There is also a mode where enemies can only be killed by Georg while Trev holds the monster with his psychic attack. The game can be played with either music or sound effects.",
