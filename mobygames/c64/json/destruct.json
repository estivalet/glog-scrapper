  "description": "In this side view horizontally shooter which constantly scrolls from left to right, you must fly over the surface of a planet in a jet suit and blast or avoid alien ships with your laser over 20 levels. As you avoid or shoot the ships you must also avoid touching the surface and obstacles or you lose one of five lives. Asteroids also appear on screen and these need destroying with multiple shots to reveal a crystal which are needed for when you face the end of level boss. Your laser can't destroy the boss but the crystals can so you need to collect as many as you can.<br><br>Once the boss is destroyed you move onto two bonus levels which first sees you keeping a red energy orb in front of you for as long as possible, before flying through an asteroid field avoiding the rocks as your laser doesn't work. Once you have failed or completed the bonus screens, it's onto the next level. Two players can play and each player takes it in turn when the other player dies.",
