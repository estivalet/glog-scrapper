  "description": "<i>Monkey Business</i> is a puzzle game featuring a variant of the 'Towers of Hanoi' tile game. The player needs to help a stack of monkeys retrieve two apples from a tree. They are only allowed to move one monkey at a time, and players may only arrange the monkeys such that a smaller monkey is on top of a larger monkey. There are three locations the monkeys may be moved to, and by moving the monkeys around to the different locations, players can re-stack them under an apple so they may pick it. When both apples have been picked, the level is complete. The score is based on the number of moves it takes to complete this task. There are three skill levels, each of which have a different number of monkeys that must be manipulated.",
