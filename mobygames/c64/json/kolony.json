  "description": "<i>Kolony</i> is a turn-based strategy game, putting the player in the position of a governor of a colony on a distant planet. The goal of the game is to accumulate 100 million of currency within 10 years. The game is divided into turns, with each turn representing a single month. <br><br>Main source of money is excavating and selling natural resources (silicon, iron, uranium, food) to merchant ships which arrive every few turns. In order to excavate a resource, the player must first send expeditions of colonists and scientists until a mine is found. Excavating a resource requires the presence of miner robots, human colonists to direct them, and electricity. Electric power is created by generators, which use up some uranium each turn. <br><br>Building new structures (warehouses, residences for the staff, factories, landing sites for merchant ships) requires spending resources, and takes some electric power too. Once a factory is constructed, the player can produce machines such as robots and generators, though this requires staff, time and electric power as well. <br><br>Food is gathered from fields; the more colonists are assigned to the fields, the more food is harvested every six months. New staff can be recruited from arriving merchant ships. <br><br>The players (if there is more than one) can attack each other, but have to build up an army first, consisting of starfighters, battle robots and soldiers.
