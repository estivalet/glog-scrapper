  "description": "Bounce It is a platformer that requires you to safely guide a basketball to a basket at the end of several screen-sized levels. Running out of time or colliding with objects such as glass bottles or laser beams destroys the ball. Other balls can be collected to gain points and extra lives. At the right side of the screen is a bar that gets constantly filled if the ball isn't bouncing. Once it is filled completely, the ball is destroyed, which means you have to jump every few seconds in order to make it to reach the exit. ",
