  "description": "You are Seymour, a round, happy fellow with legs and arms. You are an aspiring film producer, and you're about to fulfill your dream: producing a hit western movie. But everything goes awry when an enigmatic fellow known only as &quot;El Bandeeto&quot; destroys your script and litters your equipment all over your studio. Your goal is to retrieve these things and then to safely arrive at the shooting location. <br><br><i>Wild West Seymour</i> is an action-adventure game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Dizzy\">Dizzy</a> series. It consists of four levels (film studio, town, desert and prairie) where you have to use both your wits and your reflex to get the necessary items and use them to solve puzzles. You can hold up to three items at once, which forces you to do some skillful inventory management. Beware of dangers, such as deep water, which can damage you - you have a limited number of lives! ",
