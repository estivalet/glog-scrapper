  "description": "<i>Armageddon</i> is based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/missile-command_\">Missile Command</a> where you are the commander of a Missile Battery and you have to protect six cities in this single screen shooter. Nuclear tracers fall from the top of the screen leaving behind a trail and as you move a cross-hair around the screen, you must fire a limited supply of missiles and allow them to explode in front of each trail to destroy them. If a nuclear tracer hits a city then it is destroyed and if all cities are destroyed then it is game over. A plane occasionally flies over the screen from left to right and you get bonus points for destroying it. Once a wave is over then bonus points are awarded for any cities and missiles left before being re-armed and you then protect the remaining cities from another attack. On the C64, you can choose the wind speed (0-9) before the game starts, with zero being no wind.",
