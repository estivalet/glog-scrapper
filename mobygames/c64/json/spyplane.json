  "description": "In this text adventure, instead of the usual controlling a person or creature and wandering around various locations, <i>Spyplane</i> has an unique twist in that you control a plane over the sea. You are the Captain of a Long Range Maritime Aircraft flying at 15000 ft over the Arzelean Sea searching for enemy crafts like boats and submarines belonging to the Turyan. On board your plane you are equipped with lots of equipment that include radios, radar, ECM, Sonar and many others to help in your mission. <br><br>The aim of the mission is to get intelligence from each craft you spot to receive a score and hopefully get 100% before landing at your base. As well as fly in various directions, you can fly up or down and you need to fly to around 500 ft to get a lot of the intelligence being wary that the crafts don't bring you down. Weather is an important factor like fog and rain, and if you fly over land then you need to be careful of mountains.  Once you are happy with your intelligence reports you can land at your base but must go through the correct procedures for landing.",
