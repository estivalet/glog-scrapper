  "description": "<i>Twin Tornado</i> is a flight simulator that allows you to fly a jet and participate in a dog-fight, either against the computer or a friend. Before you participate you can have a training flight to allow you to get used to the controls. Any mistakes you make that will affect your flight, the border flashes red to warn you but allows you to keep flying. You start on a runway in all game modes and you are able to land as well.<br><br>The screen is split into two with the top half your view from the cockpit and the bottom half your instrument panel. The instrument panel is detailed and includes what you would find on a flight simulator. You will find various instruments like Altimeter, Speed, Compass, Horizon and many others. You use a joystick to control your plane including using a second one to control your speed. The keyboard is used adjust instruments or use other elements of your plane.<br><br>The big selling point was that you could purchase a cable from the company and connect two Commodore 64's to have a dog-fight against a friend. Playing against your friend or computer after taking-off you had to fly up to 6000ft before the enemy plane could be detected. The computer has 16 levels of skill to choose from. ",
