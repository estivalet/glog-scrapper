  "description": "Named after the Greenpeace ship that was sunk in the 1980's, this was an environmentally themed game. There were seven different campaigns, with each one featuring a different style of game inspired by actual Greenpeace actions. These included blocking pipes to stop the release of nuclear waste (while avoiding mutated wildlife), stopping waste from being dumped at sea, saving a whale and stopping acid rain. While the games were rather simplistic, it was interesting to see it at the time, released on the Microstyle label (set up by Microprose as &quot;games for adults&quot;, aiming at a mature audience, after the acquisition of Telecomsoft).",
