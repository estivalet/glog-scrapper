  "description": "A millionaire has decided to set up a video arcade in a castle full of meanies, and he leaves his one and only maintenance droid to go around the building each day and turn on all fifteen video machines, ready for the day customers. Some machines are out in the open, while others are in rooms with locked doors. The keys are found scattered around the arcade, many of them also found in rooms that are locked. It is up to the robot to find the key of the same color. After getting the keys, the door will be unlocked so that the droid can get to the key or video machine.<br><br>When the robot comes into contact with a machine, it gives it the option of gamble for an extra life or for its death. The droid can also decline to gamble, leaving the machine activated and an bonus is awarded, depending on how much remaining energy the droid has.<br><br>Each room is filled with a variety of hazards; including meanies that regenerate when shot at, and laser beams and sliding blocks that must be avoided. Starting from the first room that the droid enters, its energy quickly drains, meaning that the droid needs to find a machine as quickly as possible.\n",
