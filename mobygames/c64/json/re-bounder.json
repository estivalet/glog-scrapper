  "description": "Bounder is back! Again your in control of an tennis ball, that bounces and bounces and bounces... <br><br>This time you must collect smart bombs to finish the game. You need to collect all of them: 16 smart bombs.<br><br>Avoid bad stuff for landing like sand, spikes, traps or enemies. Unknown squares, signed with an &quot;?&quot; awaiting you: sometimes helpful (higher/longer jumps, extra-time and soon) - other times they're traps too.<br><br>Excellent parallax-scrolling, nice graphics and sounds will give you a great time with this one, easy to play - but damn' hard to win!",
