  "description": "In <i>Lunar Outpost</i>, you're the commander of the Lunar Assault Vehicle assigned to defend Earth's lonely lunar outpost against a never-ending attack of Zytrons.  Spaced throughout the lunar outpost are a number of supply buildings.  These must be defended at all costs, but how many days can you hold off the Zytron assault?\n \nGame play consists of 2 different screens.  There is a lunar map, where you can see the different structures of the Lunar base, and the incoming Zytron assault vessels.  Each day, 4 waves of 1 - 6 Zytron vessels approach, trying to destroy your outpost, and you must move to intercept these invaders.  The map also hosts power strips which allow the player to move without using energy, power stations which recharge its batteries, repair stations, munition buildings which restock your vehicle's missiles, and pulsars which if activated destroy an enemy wave.  <br><br>When you intercept a Zytron wave, you enter the combat zone.  Here, you have a 3D portrayal of your assault vehicle, and the goal is to position your vessel beneath the enemy ships and destroy them by firing missiles.  While you are battling an individual wave, the other Zytron ships will continue to wreck havoc on your lunar base, and you may have to break off combat to defend other areas.  <br><br>There are 3 difficulty levels: Level 1 Alpha Base, Level 2 Lunar Command, and Level 3 Farside Station. Points are awarded based upon the number of enemy ships destroyed, and the total number of days the player 's base survives.  The game will end when a player has survived a whole lunar month of 28 days, or all of their buildings have been destroyed.",
