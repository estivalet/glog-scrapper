  "description": "It's time to dust off your bike and take a tour of Britain, a lovely 687 miles from Newcastle to Westminster. This is the Kellogg's Tour 1988 and you must compete against other riders to win this long and arduous race. There are many jerseys to collect on the way, King of the Mountain, winning the sprint stages, winning a stage and the overall leader. <br><br>The game is viewed from the side as a horizontal scrolling game. On the main screen at the top you can see your rider and the other riders who pass you or you pass them. The bottom of your screen is your power, speed, stamina, food, the steepness of the road and your gears. To move your rider you have to waggle the joystick left and right. Moving the joystick up and down steers and pressing fire will change your gear from low to high and back again. This is important for the steepness of the road.",
