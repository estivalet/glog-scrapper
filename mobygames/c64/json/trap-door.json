  "description": "Berk is trying to obtain a chest of treasure from within a castle inhabited by the Bad Tempered Thing. This involves completing five tasks, although a learner mode in which only 4 are required is also provided. The first task is to provide a can of worms, whilst crushed eyeballs must be provided for task two. You then need to boil Slimies, fry eggs (getting them is a dilemma in itself), and then force everything back into the trapdoor. These tasks must be completed before Thing’s Angry Meter reaches its limit.<br><br>As fans of the TV show will recall, the Trap Door of the title seals in numerous strange monsters, and in the game some are harmful and some are a hindrance, depending on the task at hand, so be careful which ones are released. Remember to close it, as spooks will be released if you do not – these require food to be pacified. Boni and Drutt appear regularly – the former giving cryptic morsels of advice, and the latter eating spiders and getting in the way. You can prepare for one task while completing another, so pay attention to items which may be useful, and think about what they are likely to be used in conjunction with.\n",
