There is also talk of a fake version and this needs to be found as well and brought back. As you explore the surrounding areas you will get hungry so food needs to be found and eaten to keep your strength up. <i>Diamond Trail</i> is a text adventure where the screen has text describing each location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.",
