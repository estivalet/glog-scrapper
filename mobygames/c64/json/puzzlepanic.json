  "description": "Puzzle Panic consists of a series of small pattern-based puzzles, through which you guide Benny (a light-bulb) to the correct answers. Each level can be played individually, or in sequence as part of a larger puzzle, where each level is signified by a unique symbol, that users must discover to complete the final puzzle.<br><br>Some puzzles are timed challenges, such as &quot;Color Climb&quot;, where Benny must climb a series of coloured steps, with clues to the correct colour provided at the top of the screen. <br><br>Others are pattern based, such as &quot;Triangles First&quot;, where Benny must touch all triangles on the screen, followed by squares, then pentagons, etc. In these levels, Benny must also avoid being captured by a Devil-shaped enemy who is chasing him.<br><br>Every level requires the player to recognise some form of shape, colour, number and/or spatial pattern.<br><br>Completing each level reveals a series of gates containing different symbols, and passage through these gates will help Benny discover the relationship between the symbols and the levels. In the final level, the &quot;metasequence&quot;, Benny must correctly identify the symbol representing each level, and select them in the order that they were played.",
