  "description": "<i>First Strike</i> is an action-based flight game with a F-16 aircraft, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=After+Burner\">After Burner</a>. The player can choose from eight missions with different scenarios, like the Middle East or Russia. The goal of each mission is to destroy a number of targets which are reached by flying around the playfield. The ammo supply and fuel needs to be selected before starting the mission and has an considerable influence on the mission itself: different weapons are more or less effective against different targets. On the other hand, running out of fuel during a mission results in death. The playing perspective is directly behind the plane and the starting/landing sequences are automatic.",
