  "description": "The object of the game is to collect hearts and deliver them to Olive Oyle to keep her 'lovemeter' topped up. Points are scored for hearts delivered.\nBluto, UFO's, witches etc try to stop you. Some hearts are behind locked doors so you've got to find the right key to open the door and get them while others can be grabbed simply by jumping up to get them.\nSomewhere there's a fruit machine for which you need to collect 'spin' items.<br><br>The game boasts a 'clever multidimensional effect' which allows Popeye to go behind the scenery and go through doors. <br><br>",
