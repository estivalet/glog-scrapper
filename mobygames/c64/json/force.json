  "description": "<i>The Force</i> is a strategy game that allows you to control the police force in a fictional town called Middletown. You start the game looking at a map of the whole town which is split into 16 squares and consists of four police stations, each one covering a certain area with its own equipment and type of policing. The town is made up of the usual areas found in most British towns like urban areas, residential areas, entertainment areas and industrial estates. You will also find that the town has an airport for the arrival of important visitors and a football stadium for an up-and-coming team. A diary can also be checked to see any large events happening in the near future.<br><br>Moving a cursor you can click on any police station and look closer at certain areas of the town with icons showing which type of police are there, and any crime and events that are happening. You can move the icons around into other areas but the computer only allows the correct ones to be placed and three daily shifts a day must always be manned as you control the police forces on a daily basis. Once a week has been completed then a small minigame appears where you have to control the traffic lights on various roads to keep the traffic flowing for a short time. ",
