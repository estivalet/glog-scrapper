  "description": "<i>Humm-Dinger</i> is a side view horizontal scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls when you move your hero using a Jet-Pack, left or right, blasting waves of aliens. In each wave you must destroy every alien so that it will drop a B icon, and when a certain amount has been collected before they touch the ground you can then face a final wave to destroy. As you move and shoot around the level, you must avoid touching the aliens or their weapons as this decreases an energy gauge faster which is slowly decreasing. When your energy gauge empties then you lose one of four lives. Allowing a B icon to hit the ground also decreases the gauge but some destroyed waves of aliens drops a F icon and when collected fills your energy gauge. Once you have completed a level then you have the chance to get bonus points by collecting all the numbered ions in order before your energy gauge empties but if you collect an icon in the wrong order then the bonus part is over and it's on to the next level.",
