  "description": "The Pharoah's Lost Tomb contains the valuable emerald of Scarabaeus, and you have set off to find it. You walk around from an early first-person view with 90 degree movement and four views from each position, aided by a map. On the first level you must touch nine ghosts, to collect pieces of a key to know which of the objects you will later find are medicines, and which are potions. <br><br>While on level 2, you must visit information sites - you will need this to survive on level 3. These are guarded by spiders, which must be trapped and lured away using doors. To move between levels you must guide a mechanical lift, by moving the joystick in smooth circles from inside it. This final level contains familiar safe bottles as well as poisonous ones - all stored on hidden shelves. It also contains zombies to avoid or trap.<br><br>Before you can reach the emerald, you must solve a final puzzle involving hieroglyphs. Arrange a 4x4 grid so as to get the rows and columns to match, within 40 moves.",
