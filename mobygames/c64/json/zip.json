  "description": "<i>Zip</i> puts the player in control of a robot that can move in eight directions and fire a laser. The robot is placed in single-screen levels where it must destroy various hazards. Destroying targets earns the player points and destroying mines can clear paths. Mystery objects will present the player with a random effect, which could be a lot of points or being teleported to another part of the maze. When the robot hits a wall it will bounce back in the opposite direction, but when hitting a mine or other obstacle the game ends. The goal is to score as many points as possible.",
