  "description": "<i>Westminster</i> is a political strategy game based on a General Election in British politics and the aim is for one to four players to get a party (Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats or Independents) into Government. Each player starts with £8000 and they must visit as many constituencies from a choice of 60 and canvas for votes. At the start of the game after how many turns are to be played (1 - 120), each player starts at a random constituency and the first player is shown how many people plan to vote for each of the parties. The player then decides how much to spend on their campaign before the next players constituency is shown. <br><br>Once all players have started a campaign, each player then is shown a list of constituencies to visit and after selecting one the same procedure of seeing how the votes are spread for each party and how much should be spent for each campaign. There are also updates on how a player is doing in other places shown by a newspaper headline. Once all the turns have been completed there is an option to extend the amount of turns but if this is not taken then the counting of votes begin. The results of the General Election is shown and the winner is the player who has been given the role of Government and hopefully a majority has been won.",
