  "description": "<i>Phase 4</i> is a space themed shoot-em-up. You control a fighter craft who must blast its way through four levels of alien ships. Each level has a unique background and set of re-spawning opponents, and the aim is to reach a target number of aliens destroyed before moving onto the next level. The first three levels are vertical shoot-em-ups with a landscape of alien pyramids, the darkness of space, and an alien city as background. The final level is a horizontal shooter over a built-up area. After the four levels are completed, the game loops back to the beginning with a larger quota of enemy to be destroyed.<br><br>The game comes with several difficulty options. One option allows use of a shield which gives you invulnerability for a short period of time. Another allows guided missiles, which follow the horizontal (or vertical for phase 4) position of your ship after firing. The final option allows the use of a limited number of smart bombs to destroy all of the on-screen opponents.",
