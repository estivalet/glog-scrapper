  "description": "<i>Draughts</i> is a version of the board game between two players which allowed the players to use a Light Pen to move the pieces to remove all the other player's counters from the board. Draughts is played on a 8 x 8 black and white board, with each players 12 counters being in one colour, blue or grey. All the counters are on the white squares and can only move diagonally forwards one square to another white one. To remove another players counter, the player has to jump a counter by placing their piece one place behind the other player's counter. The jumped counter is then removed from the board and if there is a jumping chance then that piece has to be jumped. If a player reaches the other side of the board then they put another one of their counters (removed from the board) on top and now the counter has been 'Kinged'. A King counter can now move forwards and backwards around the board and there is no limit how many Kings are allowed.",
