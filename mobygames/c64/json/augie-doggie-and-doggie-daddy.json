  "description": "<i>Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy</i> is a game based on the Father and son Hanna-Barbera characters where you play the role of Augie Doggy, as you attempt to rid your house of pests while Doggie Daddy naps. The game is split into four side view scrolling levels, with each level set in a different part of the house and they are, The Basement, Downstairs, Upstairs and The Attic. Each level has a separate pest which are Mice, Bees and Beetles, and there are ten of them to remove with a net before the clock counts down to zero. You start on the left side of a level and you must walk collecting the pests but you can only carry five at a time so once your net is full you must go back to the left to watch an animated scene of you freeing the pests. <br><br>There are many obstacles and other creatures like bats, balls or an animal on a paper plane dropping bombs and these need avoiding because if you are touched then you lose one of five lives. There are also various objects that can be collected for bonus points as well as pieces of cheese and when you collect a whole wheel of cheese then you are awarded more points. On the second level, Downstairs, as well as pest collecting you must also catch falling plant pots because if they hit the ground then your Daddy slowly wakes up shown by a pair of eyes at the bottom of the screen. If Daddy wakes then he tells you off and you lose a life as well. ",
