  "description": "<i>BreakThru</i> is a 2D side-scrolling vehicle shooter. Your mission: race, jump, and blast your way through five levels (mountains, bridge, plains, city, and airfield) of enemy defenses to recapture the stolen jet fighter. A host of enemy soldiers, mines, vehicles, and aircraft will try to stop you, though. Oh yeah... and don't forget to watch out for those rocket attacks and falling rocks!",
