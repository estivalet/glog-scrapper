  "description": "<i>The Quest for the Holy Grail</i> falls into the genre of a text adventure game but in addition to the text there are simple pictures which help add to the descriptions of the locations you are in and add to the atmosphere as you move around the game world.<br><br>You take on the role of the knight Sir Tappin, who is on a mission to track down the Holy Grail. You must navigate your way around the villages and countryside of medieval England to track down the clues that will help you on your quest. You will need to find objects to help you negotiate your way past the characters dotted along the way, such as the White Rabbit and the Knight Who Says Nic. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a trip through a possible version of history, with a liberal sprinkling of humour thrown in too.",
