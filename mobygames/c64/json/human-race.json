  "description": "<i>The Human Race</i> is a single player game with different game styles on each level.<br><br>The aim of the game is to achieve a high score. This is done by jumping around the screen and collecting objects.  Each single screen level is set at a different point in man's evolution and sees the character start as an ape and evolve into a caveman and beyond as the player progresses through the game. <br>Each level is a different kind of mini-game. For example the first level is a platform style game where the player leaps through the jungle eating bananas and avoiding nasty creatures such as dinosaurs, while level two has the player negotiating a path through a lava lake while avoiding falling fireballs.<br><br>This game is played using a joystick.
