  "description": "You have discovered and explored a hidden valley in a jungle and came across treasure which you have taken. The natives aren't too happy with you stealing their stuff so you must escape on your B.M.X. bike while avoiding obstacles, traps and various creatures. <i>BMX Jungle Bike</i> is a side view flick-screen game where you must move from left to right on each screen while trying not to hit anything. You can control the speed of your bike as well as having the ability to jump with the height determined by your speed. If you hit any obstacle then you lose one of three lives and you start at the left of the screen you are on. You can select the game speed (1-4) at the start of the game with four being the slowest.",
