  "description": "<i>Lemans</i> is a driving game where you must try to overtake as many cars as you can to get to 20,000 points within 60 seconds to drive for another 60 seconds when the clock reaches zero. The game is viewed from above as you drive horizontally up the screen which scrolls when you drive and you press the fire button to accelerate and let go to slow down. You can move left or right but can't move forwards or backwards.<br><br>As you drive, various cars will move down the screen (drive too slow and they come up the screen) either in a straight line or will move left or right across the road. If you touch a car then your car will be covered in smoke and a pit lane appears on the left. When you drive into the pit lane your car is repaired and you can rejoin the race but this does waste valuable seconds. Touching the side of the road slightly slows you down but hit too hard and you must use the pit lane. Passing 10 cars in a row without crashing gives you a 1000 point bonus. It is game over when the clock reaches zero and you haven't accumulated enough points.",
