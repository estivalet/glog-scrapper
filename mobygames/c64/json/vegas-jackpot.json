  "description": "<i>Vegas Jackpot</i> is a simulation of the gambling fruit machine. The player tosses the coin in the slot of the video machine and starts to spin the reels, waiting for the winning combination to appear for a single-pay line. To increase the chances, it is possible to hold certain reels or to nudge them for a certain number of times when it is allowed. The goal of the game is to win jackpots. The amount of reels in the video machine is equal to three for ZX Spectrum, BBC / Electron and Dragon 32/64 versions, and to four for other versions.",
