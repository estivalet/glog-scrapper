  "description": "<i>Go</i> is a computer implementation of the classic board game.<br><br>Played on a 19 x 19 grid, it allows for 2-player competitive or 1-player versus computer play.  Players take turns placing either a black or a white marker on the screen, with the goal to capture the opponent's piece by surrounding it in the 4 cardinal directions.  The winner is the player with the most captured pieces after the board is filled.  The player can set a computer handicap which allows them to start with 0 - 9 friendly pieces on the board.  ",
