  "description": "<i>Moptown Hotel</i> is an educational logic game for multiple systems.<br><br>An early educational game that teaches logic and pattern recognition skills for ages 9 and up.  It uses a set of creatures called Moppets, which can be Gribbits (with tails) or Bibbits (with large feet), fat or thin, tall or short, and red or blue.  Consists of a number of mini-games:<br><br><i>Who's Next Door?</i> - The player has 3 characters, where one change has been made from the top row to the bottom row.  The player must guess the correct missing character in the bottom row.  <br><br><i>Change Me</i> - The player must move between the character on the left and the character on the right by making 1 or 2 attribute changes in each pane.  <br><br><i>Spot Me</i> - The player is presented with 4 Moppets, and must determine which one has a trait that is different than the other 3, and what that trait is.  <br><br><i>Happy Birthday?</i> - The player needs to choose which Moppet has their birthday today.  All 16 Moppet combinations appear, and the player must choose one.  For each choice, the player is told one characteristic which is incorrect, until they can narrow down the correct Moppet.  <br><br><i>Secret Pal</i> - Similar to the board game Master Mind, the player must attempt to guess the characteristics of a Moppet, and each guess are told how many of 4 attributes are correct.  <br><br><i>Moptown Map</i> The player has a 4 x 4 square, that Moppets must be filled in.  Each row and column has two rules for who can live there.  The game tells the player which Moppets are placed correctly.  <br><br><i>Moptown Hotel</i> - The player attempts to place Moppets in a 4 x 4 grid, where they must have only 1 or 2 characteristics different than all surrounding Moppets.  The player receives a bonus based upon number of Moppets placed.  <br><br><br><br>",
