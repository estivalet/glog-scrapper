  "description": "In Maze Master you create a party of three characters, each either a Warrior or a Wizard and venture into the labyrinth to defeat monsters, gain experience and ultimately confront the Balrog.\nInitially you start outside the maze, where you can create your party and purchase equipment. Once equipped you enter the maze which is presented as a 3D wireframe. Control can be either via keyboard or joystick. It is recommended to map the maze on graph paper in order to be able to make your way back to the exit.\nAs you explore the maze you will encounter various monsters including dwarves, goblins and rogues. As you descend farther down into the levels of the maze, harder monsters will appear. You must also look for clues as to how to get past the Balrog's mystical aura which prevents entry into the lowest level of the maze.\nDefeating monsters will provide gold and experience. You can purchase better weapons and armor as well as magic items with gold. Experience increases the power of your party members.",
