  "description": "You have come to <i>Twin Kingdom Valley</i> which is one of many valleys that surround Lake Watersmeet to make your fortune by finding treasure and even robbing certain locals who live here as well. Be warned as the people of the land move about in real time going about their business so people won't be in the same place twice. You have rented a hut  from the local inn, The Sword Inn so you can store everything that you collect (or Steal). Other items can be found to make your quest easier like swords and armour. There is even talk that the secret of life is hidden here. <br><br><i>Twin Kingdom Valley</i> is a graphic text adventure where you will see a picture (with some animation) of your location before seeing a text description of what you can see, any items and any characters in that location. You type in commands to control your player. You can ask to see your score and your strength score. Your strength score is high at the start but not eating or drinking, or being attacked will weaken you and decrease your strength score, but you can wait (if it is safe) to increase it. The aim of the game is to get 1024 points.<br><br>The mobile phone release is an expanded version of the game with additional locations, puzzles and creatures.  It also features predictive text entry.\n ",
