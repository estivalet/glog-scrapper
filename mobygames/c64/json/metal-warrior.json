Ian, a young metal guitarist, finds his bandmate Sadok shot; rumor has it that sinister forces have it in for heavy metal bands, and after recovering from his hangover, Ian sets out to investigate.  His quest takes him into the streets teeming with mutants and thugs, as he seeks to contact his remaining bandmates and gradually piece together the details of the conspiracy.<br><br>As the game progresses Ian will have to take on the bad guys using a variety of weapons, procure money to make purchases, find or buy certain essential items to unlock new quests and areas, and talk to NPCs for hints on what is happening and what to do.  The game is divided into episodes, with graphical cutscenes serving to communicate the plot.",
