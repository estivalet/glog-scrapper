  "description": "<i>Thunderbolt</i> is set in the future and is about the war between humans and the planet Proxima. Both experiment with chronoclasm bombs which has the ability to destroy items from the future or past. Unfortunately a big accident during a trial run causes the space-time continuum to collapse. The immediate consequence for the player, manning a Thunderbolt jet fighter, is that he has to fight his way through enemies from different decades.<br><br>The game is a horizontally scrolling shooter with the basic promise of flying from left to right without getting destroyed. Helpful are the two weapon systems: the unlimited standard attack and a special attack which causes every enemy on the screen to die. Every hit and touch with the environment causes the players fuel reserve to decrease. The latter is important because there are many structures which can only be passed with precise positioning.",
