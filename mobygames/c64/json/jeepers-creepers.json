  "description": "<i>Jeepers Creepers</i> is a top view single screen game where you control a spider who has to infect seven rows of cabbages by changing their colour when you move over them. You can move in multiple directions as well as diagonally as you infect all the cabbages before a bonus timer reaches zero to move to the next level. As you move around the screen, there are other creatures like a bird that eats you and loses you one of three lives, a fly that turns the cabbages back but can be eaten for bonus points, and a caterpillar that turns the cabbages back as well but cannot be eaten but won't harm you. Before you start the game you can select the first five levels to play.",
