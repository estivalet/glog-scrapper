  "description": "The pyramids found on Earth were actually brought from the planet T-Pyge, who built and sold them to many other planets as well. Two transporters were needed to transport the pyramids to the planets, one for the structure and one for the power supply to keep it functioning. This was very costly until it was decided to turn off the pyramid and turn it back on when it got to the client. You have just transported four pyramids to Earth and now you have the task of powering each one up in this flick-screen platform game. Each pyramid ranges in size from the smallest that just contains 14 rooms to the largest which contains 54. <br><br>You send in a spheroid to locate all power points on each level within each pyramid but you have no control over the spheroid except to make it jump. The spheroid moves in one direction until it bounces of an object and moves in that direction but touching objects loses it's energy and when the energy is zero you lose one of three lives. On each screen you have to control certain objects like springs and moving platforms which when timed right will move the spheroid in the direction you need. To also help you there are energy charging points, anti-grav pads, accelerators and transporters to transport the spheroid to other levels.",
