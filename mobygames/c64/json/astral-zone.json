  "description": "The Earth has been attacked by the Vengrian Empire with all the armed forces destroyed by their fighters and cruisers leaving you the last line of defence to keep the human race alive. In this 1st person shooter, you control a cross-hair from two neutronium cannons and you move the screen to the left or right, and up or down to destroy any alien that appears from the back of the screen. As you fire and destroy, the aliens will fire back and if you are hit then you receive 20% damage but if you get over 5000 points then the damage is reduced by 20%. When your damage reaches 100% then it is game over. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns when the other player receives damage.",
