  "description": "<i>Krypto</i> is a mathematical card game. The deck consists of 52 cards; two sets of with the numbers 0 through 25. Each player is dealt five cards at the start of the game and one card is placed face up for all players to see. In a player's turn the goal is to use all five cards in the player's hand to recreate the number on the open target card. To get to this number the player can propose a mathematical expression using add, subtract, multiply and divide operators as well as parentheses. If the expression is correct the player wins the game. If the expression is incorrect or the player doesn't make a proposal within three minutes the player loses its turn. If the player cannot make an expression he or she can opt to trade one of the cards from his or her deck with a new one, but this also ends the player's turn.",
