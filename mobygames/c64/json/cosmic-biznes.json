The game features all of the official rules of the original board game, reproducing most aspects of the gameplay. The primary difference is the theme of the game. The player buys planets on a various galaxies. The game screen consists of a top-down view of the board.  Events, comments and descriptions appear on a separate screen in text form. Each uninhabitable planet may be enhanced by building 4 bases and colony. Each modernization increases the penalty paid by the enemy for intrusion into the foreign territory.
