  "description": "<i>Scrambit</i> is a 1 - 4 player trivia game involving unscrambling words.<br><br>Players are asked trivia questions on four different topics.  Players are asked 5 - 10 questions, and are given between 10 - 60 seconds depending on version and player choice to answer questions.  Players are presented with a question, and the letters of the answer are scrambled.  The player can choose to rescramble the letters as many times as they wish, as they try to type out the answer in the time allotted.  As time goes by, the number of points for a correct answer are reduced, and the player received 0 points if they can't answer in time.  At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.",
