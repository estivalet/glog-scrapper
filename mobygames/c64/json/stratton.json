  "description": "The Stratton Air Terminal is the latest comfort in space travel. Disaster has struck though. A terrorist bomb has exploded on one of the shuttles forcing it to crash into the terminal. The moorings have been smashed and all life support systems have been cut off. The fall defence units are now active causing any survivors to be cut off.<br><br>You have been sent in to save the day. Sat inside a buggy you have to deactivate the Central Computer, rescue survivors and make the base safe. With the entrance code gone you have to remove all the breakers and remove the last databus to shut down the computerised and mechanical parts.<br><br>The game is viewed from above in a multi-directional maze. Move your buggy with the joystick and press fire to fire your lasers. <br><br>",
