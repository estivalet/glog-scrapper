  "description": "<i>Alternate Reality: The Dungeon</i> directly follows its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/alternate-reality-the-city\">predecessor</a>: The player is still captured by aliens and imprisoned in an alternate reality. After visiting the city, now he proceeds to the dungeon with only one goal in mind: surviving. <br><br>While the predecessor was more about exploring the city, this installment has a largely linear path - the dungeon consists of four levels which have to be visited in order. But the surroundings don't mean that there are only monsters to fight in the turn-based combat system or treasure to loot: the player still has the shops, e.g. an inn or a smithy, to his disposal. Even the six \nguilds (plus two additional ones) found their way into the dungeon; this time the player even may become a member. An important change in gameplay is that all items have a weight associated with them - carrying too much is bad for speed and endurance.<br><br>The dungeon is separated from the city and after entering there is no turning back. Save games can be imported, but the player loses all potions but sixteen.<br><br>\n",
