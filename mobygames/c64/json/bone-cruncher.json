  "description": "In <i>Bone Cruncher</i> the player takes the role of Bono, a dragon who makes a living by selling soap. His secret of success: he uses skeletons as ingredients. To restock, Bone has to collect more skeletons by traveling through a castle with 22 scrolling levels.<br><br>This game is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> variant. The levels are filled with dirt (which vanishes when Bono walks over it), monsters , and glooks (basically rocks with eyes). Monsters can only travel on ways without dirt and their touch is hazardous - some even eat up the skeletons. There are 25 skeletons to find in each level and specific steps have to worked out to reach them (e.g. using a glook to cut off a specific monster's path), giving the game a puzzle-solving character.",
