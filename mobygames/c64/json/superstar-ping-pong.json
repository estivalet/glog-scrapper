  "description": "This is a table-tennis game where one player can play against the computer or two players play against each other. It looks similar to Imagine's Ping Pong but offers more gameplay options. The table is displayed in 3D and you only see the bat (no player or your hand). You can choose if the net will be split horizontally or vertically. Hitting the ball is pretty simple, just press the fire button when the ball comes close to your bat. Depending on if you hit the ball to early or too late it returns in different angles. <br><br>While the program is loading, you have a menu where you can choose several game options like bat control (computer-guided or manual - beginners should start with computer-guided), game speed and if you want to change the sides of the table after each player has served. The most-interesting option is that you can give up to 20 skill points to 6 different hitting-options (like forehand, backhand, smash etc.). Normally the program automatically gives you 12 points overall (2 for each of the 6 hitting options) but you can change this the way you want to have it up to the max of 20 points. So you're able to increase or decrease your skills for your forehand, backhand and smashing abilities and the way you personally prefer your table-tennis gameplay. <br><br>Rules are official table-tennis rules in the 80's, first player reaching 21 points wins the game/set (option setting allows you to play 1, 2, 3 or even more sets for an match). After choosing your side on the table, and the color of your bat the action begins.",
