  "shortName": "whistlers-brother",
  "description": "The story began years ago on the campus of a large university. You were a first-year student who spent more time learning how to sufi dance with a local whirling dirvish than studying. Your brother, while always a bit more clumsy and scatter-brained than you, somehow managed to graduate with a doctorate and was immediately offered a research position in the archeology department.<br><br>Trouble began when your brother returned from a year-long research expedition in the rain forests of South America. Not only did he return without any of the tools he'd borrowed from the university, but he had no notes documenting how he had spent his year. Out of concern for your brother's future and intrigued by his repeated mumbling about priceless ancient artifacts, you decide to retrace his steps.<br><br>You earn points in the game a number of different ways: retrieving artifacts and tools, protecting yourself or your brother, and completing levels. The joystick button lets you whistle or whirl. Whistling will keep your brother safely at your side. Whirling will make you impervious to any dangers in your path. You can't whirl until you have recovered the two tools from the current level.<br><br>Play the game by maneuvering through all 16 levels, collecting artifacts and the tools. Make sure to keep your brother nearby or he may stumble into trouble. If you or he gets into trouble, you loose a life. Once you've collected the two tools use whirling to blaze past any obstacles.",
