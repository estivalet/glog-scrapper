  "description": "<i>Velocipede II</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/velocipede\">Velocipede</a>. In this action-dexterity game you find yourselves on the advanced Velocipede II firing unicycle, once again invented by Mr. Megafat, with four levels to complete within time limits. The game scrolls sidewards from left to right, with the player controlling speed but not vertical position. There are hazards to jump over and creatures to shoot or avoid. Falling into holes loses one of the player's four lives, while hitting an enemy drains an energy bar (which is refilled when a life is lost for either reason). When a level is completed, bonus points are awarded for the amount of remaining time. The game has a reputation for being very easy to complete within just a few minutes.",
