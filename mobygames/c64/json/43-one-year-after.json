  "description": "<i>'43 - One Year After</i> is a vertical-scrolling shooter heavily inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/1942arcade\">1942</a> (even a carrier take-off sequence is included). The player flies a Lockheed P-38 Lightning over the island-dotted Pacific during the World War 2, fighting against Japanese aircraft. You may collect powerups and perform defensive loop maneuver to avoid enemy fire (up to 3 times) - you have only three lives left. Player's progress is tracked on a map (left side of the screen).",
