  "description": "<i>Gun Runner</i> is based on the classic game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/choplifter\">Choplifter</a> where you must fly your helicopter over eight side-view, horizontal scrolling levels where the screen scrolls when you move to the left or the right. You must search each level for a certain amount of men within a time limit and when one is seen you must fly as low as you can and lower a winch to pick him up. Trying to stop you are various baddies that fly around each level and must be shot or avoided and if touched or you get shot then you lose one of three lives. You are equipped with three smart-bombs which destroy anything on the screen and you receive one more for every level completed. ",
