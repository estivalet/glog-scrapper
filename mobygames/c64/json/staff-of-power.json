  "description": "Before the Golden Age, the land was full of unrest and lawlessness where malevolence and greed stalked hand-in-hand. All this changed when King Arcon made the ultimate sacrifice to the Gods and for this he was given the Staff of Power, which could be used for Good or Evil. The King chose to use it for Good and the land became prosperous and peaceful with the people giving thanks to the Gods for this. All this changed though when the evil magician, Zyx managed to steal the Staff, after disguising himself as a beggar seeking justice from the King. After cursing the King, Zyx has vowed to destroy the Kingdom so a hero is needed to find Zyx, destroy him and return the Staff. You have been chosen as the hero and you must search the kingdom to find four magical items which you need to have any chance to destroy Zyx, which are a sword, shield, ring and warhorn. As you explore the land you will find many creatures but you can find and use spells to help you on your quest.<br><br><i>Staff of Power</i> is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.",
