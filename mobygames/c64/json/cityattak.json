  "description": "You are the commander of the defences for a major city and today it is getting attacked by an unknown alien force and it's your job to stop it or lose the city over 14 levels. You control a spacecraft in this side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls left or right when you move your craft, and you must blast three types of attacks by the aliens. You will encounter from mission command an airborne attack, a ground attack as well as a huge swirling ball of neutrons and each must be destroyed to move to the next level. <br><br>The airborne attack sees two rows of aliens moving from the far right of the level slowly to the left, with the top row firing a laser to destroy the city below while the 2nd row of aliens attempt to bomb you when you are underneath. Your craft can fire in four directions but you can only go as high as the tallest building so you must fire upwards within range to destroy them but you are immune if you fly at building level. The ground attack involves Urban Commandos and they run on the ground from the far right of the screen to the left and you can either bomb them or fire to the left or right at ground level to destroy them.<br><br>The final attack sees the huge ball of neutrons roll once again from the right to your mission control and the only way to destroy it is to bomb the centre from the air. If you allow it to reach the left of the level then you lose one of three lives and you also lose lives if you are hit by any weapon from the aliens. When all aliens are destroyed then you move to the next level and another attack. Before you start the game you can select any level and you can also practise as well.",
