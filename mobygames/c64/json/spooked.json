  "description": "As an experienced ghoul-chaser, you think you can handle anything when you get a call to explore a haunted mansion. You soon realize that you're wrong, however, and you'll need all of your skills to deal with 384 screens of spookiness.<br><br>It's an arcade adventure, with ghosts to avoid as they cause your character to fall off course, sometimes down a screen or two. Collecting bugs and beetles allows you to use one of the cauldrons to produce spells to kill enemies. You have 4 minutes on each life, although more can be picked up from the many egg-timers around the screens. The game keeps track of your 'Scaredyness factor' and adjusts the game difficulty to help struggling players accordingly.<br><br>The eventual target is to collect items to turn into letters - earning enough of these allows you to play a Hangman game against the 'spooky old man'.",
