You take control of a X-15 space-plane and you must fly through six different stages to destroy the terrorists orbiting space station.<br><br>You begin the game on the runway where you have to take off. After a successful take off you have to fly through three stages in Earth's atmosphere shooting and dodging, helicopters, jets and missiles. Try not to take on too much damage. In space you have to shoot satellites in order to see the space station.<br><br>When can see the space  you place your cross-hair over it, and you are met with a prompt to enter a code. You do remember the code given to you by the President at the start don't you? Successful code entries lets you launch a excursion module which needs to be flown through an asteroid belt. Once through the asteroids you can land on the station. After landing you release some Remote Control Robots which have to be controlled to find the weapon systems. Connect your robots to a weapon and it will self destruct destroying the weapon. Once all weapons are destroyed, the last robot finds the Central Power System which it destroys, destroying the Station.<br><br>The game is viewed like a flight simulator. You look out of your cockpit through a window with all your instruments surrounding the window. After take off, a cross-hair appears and allows you to shoot your weapon by pressing the fire button. The enemy is shown as 3-D vector graphics. You can also steer the plane left and right by moving the cross-hair to the edge of the window. The further up you go the sky turns darker until it turns black, indicating your in space. The space station is a blue spinning object.",
