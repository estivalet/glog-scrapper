  "description": "Chris Auker has stolen the Mandroid files and fled to Cove 4 in an effort to contact criminal mastermind, Max. A Mandroid agent is sent down on the planet to gather information concerning Auker's whereabouts and find the files. The agent can navigate the planet on foot, but to help him accomplish his task faster, he can use a remote vehicle. It can withstand most enemy fire, but it gets destroyed if it makes contact with any of the industrial waste rivers bordering the landscape. Energy is also used up, so the agent needs to stock up using depots scattered around the landscape.<br><br>While navigating the landscape, the agent encounters many types of cyborgs along the way, both on the streets and inside buildings. The agent may decide whether to communicate with most of these cyborgs, or eliminate them with his weapons. Some of the cyborgs drop weapons when shot, and the agent may swap his default weapon for their better weapons. Most of them contain map information essential in accomplishing the mission, and the only way to get this is by threatening them.<br><br>Money is necessary for success, and can be obtained by gambling or accessing credit dispensers found in the city.<br><br>",
