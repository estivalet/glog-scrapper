  "description": "The city's sewer system has been infested by monsters, and LINDA, a maintenance droid, has been sent down to flush them out with her laser gun. Different monsters have various effects on her: some will terminate LINDA on sight, while others simply drain her power. Her power can be replenished by getting batteries scattered around the sewers. Also, contact with other hazards such as water, spike pits, and pods results in her immediate termination.<br><br>LINDA may encounter a giant slime monster while navigating the sewers. Her primary objective is to destroy this monster, which take eight hits to kill. LINDA's laser gun will have no effect on the monster. So she has to collect eight grenades that are scattered around the sewers. LINDA can only carried one grenade at a given time.<br><br>LINDA begins with five lives, but extra lives are awarded in the sewers, as well as bonuses and mystery objects. A report card at the end of the game shows, among other things, kills made, lives lost and collected, the time of completion, final score, and overall progress.<br><br><br><br>",
