In the game the player takes on the role of the task force commander in the pacific theater during World War II. In the six simulated conflicts the player can play as both the U.S. and the Japanese Empire.

The player can gives orders to the individual units and squadrons, which include naval vessels and land based aircraft. The computer then simulates how they perform their actions. The game is quasi real-time, meaning that the game can be paused at any given moment at which time the player can give orders to the units. All interaction with the game is through a menu interface. Orders that can be given to units include strike, escort, transport, support, refuel and more complex maneuvers such as strike routines .",
