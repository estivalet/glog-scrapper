  "description": "This is an early adaptation of the popular TV game show <i>The $100,000 Pyramid</i>.<br><br>The objective is to reach the top of the pyramid by winning successive rounds. Each round consists of selecting a category from the pyramid. Each category consists of a list of words that share some common thread like &quot;things that are red&quot;. One player then tries to give the other player clues to guess the word without saying the word itself.<br><br>There is also a single player mode that does not resemble the show very much where you have to type in single word clues.",
