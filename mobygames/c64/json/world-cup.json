  "description": "<i>World Cup</i> is a football game where you and seven friends can pick one of 10 teams and compete to get to the final and win it. The computer will play as the other teams not selected. The match action is viewed from the side above the pitch and the screen shows just a part of the pitch. The screen scrolls when a player moves with the ball. A joystick or keyboard can be used to control your team.<br><br>The C16 version just has two teams playing each other with a two player option.",
