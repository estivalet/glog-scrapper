  "description": "The Master had given the order for all dragons to be killed. After the slaughter, it became apparent that one dragon, Cavilan, was missed. At the time of the slaughter she was in a cave giving birth to an egg. The Master, not happy with this, sent a band of orcs to finish the job off but Cavilan was missed again. The egg was found and taken away and stored in the Mines of Lithiad, hoping Cavilan would have come to rescue her unborn. Being too big to enter the mine she has asked yourself to rescue the egg and keep the dragons' heritage alive.<br><br>The game is a text-adventure with no graphics. The screen describes your surroundings where you can enter commands to help you on your quest.",
