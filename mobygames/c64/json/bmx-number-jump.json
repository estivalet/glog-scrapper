  "description": "<i>BMX Number Jump</i> is an educational game where it improves the maths skills of children from the ages six to ten with addition, subtraction and multiplication. The game is single screen viewed from above at an elevated angle and you must ride your BMX bike around a maze looking for the answer to jump over from a question on the right of the screen. As you move around the maze there is also a Kangaroo bouncing around and this needs avoiding because if you are caught then you lose one of five lives. Jumping over the correct answer loses the kangaroo one of his five lives and when all his lives are gone then you move to another maze. Crashing or getting the wrong answer knocks you of your bike but you don't lose a life.",
