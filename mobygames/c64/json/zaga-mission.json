  "description": "The situation on planet Zaga 1 is critical. A serious fault has occurred in the life-support power plant. The citizens count on you to get through the tunnels that leads to the power plant, and fix the problem. <br><br><i>Zaga Mission</i> is a isometric-viewed action game graphically similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zaxxon\">Zaxxon</a>. The game takes place underground. You have to navigate your helicopter through a series of mazes. As if that wasn't enough the security doors are opening and closing  unpredictably. Hit any of the walls or doors and the mission is over. Refueling stations can be found along the way, and these are necessary so you don't run out of gas.",
