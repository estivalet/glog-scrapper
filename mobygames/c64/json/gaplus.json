  "description": "You control a ship that must shoot down a number of enemy ships that attempt to kill you with bombs and kamikaze attacks. After you have destroyed all ships on screen, the next level begins. <br><br>While you are shooting down ships, you also have the opportunity to shoot down the queen ship when it shoots down. Doing so will emit a beam at the front of your ship, and this beam can be used to capture enemy ships, and make them work for you, therefore giving you double the firepower.<br><br>Occasionally, a challenging stage appears, and the object of these is to destroy three groups of enemy ship appears before all the groups disappear. For each ship destroyed, you will form a letter that makes up the word BONUS.<br><br>",
