  "description": "<i>Stationfall</i> is a text adventure game and a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/planetfall\">Planetfall</a>, featuring the same protagonist who has been promoted from Ensign Seventh Class to Lieutenant First Class. However, the current work in the Stellar Patrol seems to be less satisfying than before, as the Lieutenant has to deal with boring paperwork. One day the Lieutenant receives an assignment that involves accompanying a spacetruck to a space station and picking up a load of &quot;Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms&quot;. The Lieutenant travels to the space station with his robotic side-kick Floyd. Once they arrive, they find it deserted, with only an ostrich and an Arcturian balloon creature left untouched. The two must investigate the station and find out what happened.",
