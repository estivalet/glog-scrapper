  "description": "Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small aerofighter as protagonist. The objective of the game is to get unharmed with maximum discretion a huge bomber to destroy the enemy fleet in the Persian Gulf. To do so the player has a modern and sophisticated fighter whose power, speed and ability can get to create false images on the radar, making it worthy of the Silent Shadow nickname.<br><br>To achieve the goal 4 phases must be overcome (airbase enemy, city, desert and the enemy fleet). The idea is not to depart too much from the bomber to avoid being hit by enemy fire, being destroyed and ending the game, but neither should you go too  slow because you could clash with the bomber, then losing the few opportunities you have. Expansionary pumps are available that can destroy all enemies in sight. The game allows collaborative game where up to 2 players can take one aerofighter.",
