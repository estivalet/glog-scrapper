Scattered around the castle though are crosses which give extra lives, potions which give Gary more energy and keys which open doors.<br><br><i>Spooky Castle</i> is a flick screen platform game. Each screen shows a small part of the castle. The joystick or keyboard is used to control Gary. As well as the main playing area you can see your energy bar, keys and crosses collected.",
