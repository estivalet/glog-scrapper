  "description": "In this type-in BASIC game from <em>Compute!</em> magazine, the player takes control of a ship beset by an unfortunate set of circumstances.  Not only is it trapped in a series of caverns (presumably in space), it's also given a less-than-welcoming reception by the local residents - a rather unfriendly bunch of aliens.  In each room, four of them will try to chase down your ship, and you'll only have your forward-firing gun to get you by.<br><br>Once the room is cleared of aliens, it's on to the next one; the rooms are grouped into levels, each with more rooms than the last. Between levels, you will be treated to a bonus round, which lets you take revenge on your pursuers: the aliens are now stationary, and you will have to hunt down as many as you can before time runs out.  In each session, the game keeps track of the three highest scores.",
