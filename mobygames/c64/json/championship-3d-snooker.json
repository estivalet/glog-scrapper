  "description": "<i>Championship 3D Snooker</i> is a game based on snooker for one to eight players but uses six red balls instead of the normal 15 balls. In one player mode, the player must attempt to clear the table with a limited amount of shots which decreases everytime the player misses a shot or fouls. In two player mode, both players can play a game of snooker from 1 - 99 frames. There is also a tournament mode and it can either be played in knockout or league form with up to eight players able to play. Knockout has the players playing the best of five frames for each game while league is one frame.<br><br>To take a shot the screen shows a top view of the table where the player moves a cursor to line up the shot and holds down the fire button to choose power. The table is now viewed from the top of the table at an elevated angle and here the spin of the ball can be selected. The player then watches the shot being played before the screen moves back to top view for the next shot. The view of the table can be switched to the other end of the table and there is a replay option for each shot.",
