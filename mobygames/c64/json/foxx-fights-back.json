  "description": "Usually, it would be farmers who get sent out of the house by their lady to go off and shoot some potential food. Denton Designs reversed the roles here though, and put you in control of a fox, out for revenge.<br><br>You'll be foraging both above and below ground, with sleeping rabbits and nesting hens on offer to eat (thus replenishing your stamina), and apples, eggs, sausages, milk and the like that can be collected. All of this must be brought back to the home to your ever hungry wife.<br><br>Diverse manner of nasties are thrown at you, including eggs (from hens), nuts (from squirrels) and rocks (from badgers). Another threat for the fox are biking or shooting hounds, bombing birds, rolling hedgehogs and one life is automatically lost whenever you fall into the water. You're armed with a pistol thus are able to fight back against your enemies. At various locations in the game there are other 4 more powerful weapons to be found (shotgun, rifle, rocket launcher and machine gun) and also one extra life in the shape of a huntsman's horn.",
