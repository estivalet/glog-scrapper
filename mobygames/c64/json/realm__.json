  "description": "Keeping the planets of our Solar System in the correct orbit is controlled by the Planetary Orbiting Co-ordinator but it has stopped working and the planets are drifting away from the Sun. You have been tasked to control a robot called XR3, which has been sent into the heart of the POC to get it working and find any missing planets. The game is an arcade adventure maze game viewed from above with the screen scrolling when you move and to complete your task you have to collect all the bonus crowns scattered over the POC. Other items collected deeper in the maze are needed to solve the puzzles by placing them in the correct locations. <br><br>Blocking some parts of the maze are doors and these can only be opened by touching blue arrows but there is no indication which door it opens so trial and error is needed. If you get XR3 trapped then you can abort the mission which sees XR3 back at the start of the maze but with all items still in your possession. Abort again and it is game over as well as touching any skull and crossbones.",
