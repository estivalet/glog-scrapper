  "description": "<i>Cyberworm</i> is an uncomplicated adventure game, where you take control of a cyborg sent to infiltrate a company and retrieve some documents. There are several maze-like levels to traverse. You move around them, trying to find necessary items and locate the exit. There are guards in some rooms who may very well kill you. <br><br>There are almost no graphics - all you get are exits written on the screen. The interface is limited to the buttons in the bottom-left corner and your face in the top-right corner. ",
