  "description": "<i>Lemonade</i> puts the player in the role of a child selling lemonade in a little stand. At the start of the game the player receives $12 dollars from his/her parents and then has twelve weeks to turn it into a profit. The player is told the temperature predictions (in Fahrenheit and Celsius) and must buy ingredients (sugar, concentrate and paper cups) and set a price for each cup for the coming week. The player then sees his money increase and ingredients decrease during the week. At the end of each week the player is given a hint about what could have gone better.",
