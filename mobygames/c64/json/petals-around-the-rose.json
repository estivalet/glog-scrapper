  "description": "<i>Petals around the Rose</i> is a computerized version of a riddle that must be solved by the player. The computer will roll five dice and the player must guess the value of the petals knowing only the following hints: that the name of the game is relevant and the answer is always even. After guessing the computer will say whether the guess was correct or not. If the answer was incorrect the computer will tell the player the actual value. If the player gets the answer right a certain number of times in a row, the computer will assume the player has found the answer and bestow on him the title of Potentate of the Rose.",
