Powerful aliens guard these crystals of pure energy, intent of keeping them safe.  The discoverers of the the Star Maze, unwilling to risk their own life and limb, have traveled back almost 1000 years to the year 1981, and have published a simulation of the Star Maze.

The player can accelerate depending on the direction they are facing.  The goal is to collect 9 jewels from the maze to complete a level, while avoiding or destroying enemy ships.  The player has rapidly depleting fuel stores, and must gather resources as they explore.  If the player is struck by alien fire, they are destroyed.  The player starts with a total of 3 ships, and if all are lost, it's game over. ",
