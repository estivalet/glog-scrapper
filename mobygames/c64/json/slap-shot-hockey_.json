  "description": "This is a 2 player only hockey game. You can select from six teams.\nThey are:<ul>\n<li>Team Canada</li>\n<li>Team U.S.A.</li>\n<li>The Soviet Union</li>\n<li>Czechoslovakia</li>\n<li>Team Sweden</li>\n<li>West Germany</li></ul>\n The game has three matches that last three minutes each. You can pass the puck between players in any direction and, if an opposing player is in the path, it can be intercepted. The game also allows for body checking but if you get too rough, you can be penalized. The action can get fast so you need quick reflexes if you want to win.",
