You need to visit mining colonies and take the chemicals required. Problem is, the mines needed are under control by evil aliens so this means going by force and taking them.<br><br>You take control of the hero as he walks across the mining colonies viewed from the side. The joystick moves your man while the fire button fires your weapon. Also seen on screen is your score, shield and lives.",
