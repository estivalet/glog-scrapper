  "description": "A more accurate title for this would be &quot;Horace Goes Skiing, but only if he can brave a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Frogger\">Frogger</a> clone first&quot;, as you start the game by having to reach the ski shop to get skis, and then get back across to reach the slopes. The road is full of cars and bikes, contact with each of which costs $10 in ambulance fees out of your starting $40, and the skis themselves cost $10.<br><br>The actual skiing section has a pseudo-3D view, similar to a roving camera mounted above the course. Your task is to cut between the red and blue sets of flags, without hitting any of the trees on the course. Light contact with these will allow you to carry on; heavy contact breaks your skis and sends you back to the first section of the game (which you also return to after completing each of the courses).",
