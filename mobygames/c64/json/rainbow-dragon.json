  "description": "Players control the Rainbow Dragon who is desperately trying to get out of the cave system. To do this, they must destroy ten magic chests scattered around the cave system. These chests are blocked by a variety of obstacles which may be removed from magic.<br><br>The screen is split into two halves. The top half shows the status panel, four pillars, and four icons. Each pillar represents the slowly decaying cave system, and if all four of them split in the middle, the game ends. Also present here is a glowing staff that can be activated by the space bar, allowing you to fix the pillars and give you more time to explore the caves further.<br><br>The bottom half shows the dragon and its immediate surroundings. Crashing into the walls causes energy loss, so the player needs to carefully move the dragon around. If all of its energy is depleted, the dragon will slow down and the game will end. Some areas are blocked by laser fields, which are often turned off by moving a switch.\n",
