  "description": "This American football game is played on the street with three players on each team, picked from the local neighbourhood kids. Each kid has his own skill. There are three positions, Quarterback and two receivers. The idea is to get the ball to the other side of the street. The team attacking has four plays to move 10 yards by either throwing or running with the ball. If the defence can stop the other team moving more than 10 yards in four plays then they get the ball. <br><br>The game is viewed from the side. Here you can select which play to use. When happy with your play you control the quarterback. Move him/her in any direction with the joystick. If you want to pass then press the fire button. <br><br>There are plenty of options including how many points, how many plays etc. You can even design your own plays.",
