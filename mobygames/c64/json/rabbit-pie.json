  "description": "One day, a proud owner of a vegetable garden was so sick of rabbits digging up the garden and eating their crops, that he finally decided to hire a hunter to take care of the rabbit. In this game, players control a rabbit that must navigate a maze tracking down her four babies without getting hit by the hunter's shots. The hunter moves around so that he can get a clear shot of the rabbit.<br><br>Once the rabbit has collected her babies, she then makes her way through her burrow which is infested with creatures, to the vegetable garden where there is plenty of juicy carrots for her to munch on. She has a limited amount of time to do this, and to make matters worse, a bird flying overhead tries to bomb her with its dropping as it flies past her. However, if she drinks from some of the fountains around the garden, the bird will stop the droppings for a few seconds, allowing her to get more carrots without any trouble. Once she has eaten all the carrots, she is able to make her way back through her burrow and to try her luck again.<br><br>She had better do a good job, because if she fails, one of the meals on the owner's menu will be rabbit pie.",
