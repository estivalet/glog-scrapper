  "description": "Z-Zone is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up. The graphics are very much inspired by Andrew Braybrooks &quot;Alleykat&quot;, but the gameplay is much different. Your ship is flying very slow while you can pick up the letter &quot;P&quot; and shoot the jumping dots for points. Sometimes enemy ship formations fly down the screen which you can shoot with your weapon. Hitting anything is your instant death: enemy ships, obstacles or jumping dots. After flying some time the ship suddenly flies a bit faster, but you cannot control the speed yourself. ",
