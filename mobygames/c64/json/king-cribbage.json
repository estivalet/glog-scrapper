  "description": "Cribbage is a card game that has been popular for centuries.  In this adaptation, you compete against the computer in a standard game trying to beat your opponent to a score of 121.  Points are scored according to standard cribbage rules:\nThe game gives you a beginner play mode where the computer scores all points for both of you, or an advanced mode <i>(Muggins)</i> where you each score your own hand and can claim any points missed by your opponent (calling Muggins).\n",
