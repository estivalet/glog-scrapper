  "description": "<i>Crosscheck</i> is a trivia and word-based strategy game for 1 - 4 players for multiple platforms.<br><br>A combination of a crossword puzzle, and Scrabble, the players take turns rolling a dice numbered 1 - 9.  Depending on the roll, they will be asked a trivia question, or allowed to directly post a tile on the table.  The player's answer will always be as long as the number rolled.   If the player answers the question correctly, the answer can be placed on the board. If the player rolls a 1 or 2, they are allowed to place a single tile of their choosing on the board.  <br><br>Players can have a timed game, a goal number of points, or play until they reach their home base.  There are special bonus squares on the table, which award the player extra points.",
