  "description": "<i>ROX</i> begins with a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/lunar-lander__\">Lunar Lander</a> sequence, where the player is to land the lunar module on the planet's surface by applying vertical thrusters. Once there the objective is to protect your base  from falling meteors or &quot;ROX&quot; from space. Your module has rockets that shoot in a straight line, in three different directions to defend itself.<br><br>You also have three &quot;panics&quot; which will destroy any incoming meteors and a mothership will appear every few levels that needs to be disposed of. If a meteor hits your base or causes enough damage to the planet's surface to cause an earthquake, the game is lost.",
