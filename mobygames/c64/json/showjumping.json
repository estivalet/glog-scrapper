  "description": "<i>Showjumping</i> is a horse riding simulation that features three courses, each available at five difficulty levels. Controlling a horse, the player must guide it over gates, bars and water hazards, with approach angles and timing critical to success. Scoring can be either on time, or on faults, or both. Crowd reactions give the player an idea how they're doing. The appearance of both rider and horse can be customised.",
