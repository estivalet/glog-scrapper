  "description": "You are Arthur Dent, an Englishman with a bad hangover wearing a dressing gown containing a much needed buffered analgesic and some fluff.  Your house has just been destroyed, followed shortly thereafter by your planet Earth (mostly harmless).  You’ve been rescued by your friend Ford Prefect, who’s not actually an out-of-work actor.  He has given you a book (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy), a towel, and is now telling you to put a fish in your ear.  It must be a Thursday; you’ve never quite gotten the hang of Thursdays.<br><br><i>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</i> is written by Douglas Adams and Steven Meretzky and based on Adams’ BBC radio series, television series, and the series of subsequent novelizations.  It’s one of the classic Interactive Fiction games produced by Infocom, labeled as Science Fiction and has a Standard Level of Difficulty.  Though divergent from the source material, the main characters, locations, and concepts are here.  Unlike the book, death can come quickly if Arthur fails to observe his surroundings, collect inventory, talk to people, and consult the Guide.  DON’T PANIC!<br><br>Original C=64 <i>Grey</i> Box Contents:\nMegadodo Publications Advertising Booklet for your very own Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy complete with Fluff, Destruct orders for your home and planet, a nice red button with the words DON'T PANIC printed in large yellow letters, a pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses, No Tea, and your very own Microscopic Space Fleet. All this can be yours, for the low, low price of only 59.99 Altairian Dollars.",
