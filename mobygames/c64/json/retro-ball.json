  "description": "<i>Retro-Ball</i> is a 1 or 2-player competitive air hockey game.<br><br>Allows for 1-player versus computer or competitive play.  Each player controls the respective paddle on their side, and can use it to push the puck around the air hockey table. A point is scored when the puck is placed in the opposing team's net.  At the beginning of each game, there is a toss-up to see who goes first.  This is repeated if the puck becomes stuck on the centerline.  Each game is timed, with the goal to outscore the other player.  Players can choose from a fast or slow puck, to change game speed.",
