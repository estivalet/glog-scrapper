  "description": "It's Magic is a jump 'n run game about a tomcat called, well, Tommy who is trying to get back to his home, the Dream Islands. The story is that Tommy actually had the wish to be first one to leave the Dream Islands, and decided to work for a wizard in order to achieve this. One day, the wizard is out for a while and Tommy teleports himself away, using the wizard's spell book and crystal ball. Unfortunately, the crystal ball broke when he reached the outside world, so he needs to recollect all pieces of the crystal ball and further gather magic potions in order to get home.<br><br>The game is divided into several worlds, which again are divided into stages. Within each stage, the player must collect all diamonds and a magic potion. The letter only appears when a certain monster is killed (the monsters doe not change when starting a new game). To kill monsters, Tommy can shoot magic. Each level scrolls freely in both directions, and monsters reappear at the same spots if they were not killed. Before leaving a world, the player also has to fight a boss.",
