  "description": "<i>Classic Trainer</i> allows you to own five horses and race them over various seasons with the aim to win The Derby at the end of each season. Each season lasts 20 weeks with the choice of three races in a meeting every week if you choose to race a horse. You start the game with £5000 and before a meeting you have various options for your horses and yourself which cost you money and they are giving them a workout, treating injuries, getting a loan and retaining  a jockey. Once you are happy with your selections you are then shown your horses and their fitness, class and race stats, you also have the option to sell a horse. <br><br>After looking at your horses you are shown the next meeting where you can select one horse and race him in one of the races, with the option to bet on the horse. the early stages of the games is trying to find out the best distance for each horse to race in. There is no race animation, just a picture of a race while the result is calculated before the result is shown and then your weekly expenses. Over the weeks you keep training and racing your horses and at the end of the season at week 20 you can decide whether to enter them in The Derby remembering the costs of competing in the race. It is game over if you go bankrupt.",
