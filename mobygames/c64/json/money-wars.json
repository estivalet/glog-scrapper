  "description": "In <i>Money Wars</i> the player takes the role of a robber that has to retrieve and deliver bags of money without getting shot. The game is viewed from a side perspective. The player starts at the left side and has to move across the screen to the money bag that lies on the right side and then return to his starting position. From the top deadly arrows are shot towards him and these he has to dodge or he will lose a life. To his help he has three brick barricades that he can hide behind. He can't hide too long though as the barricades take damage from the arrows and will after a while be gone. The player can use two special functions. One that increases speed and one that creates a force field that destroys arrows. These cost energy and the player is awarded bonus points for the amount of energy he has left. When a bag of money has been delivered another one appears and the game goes on until the player has lost all of his three lives. For every fifth money bag delivered the player progresses to a new level.",
