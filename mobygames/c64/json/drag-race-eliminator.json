  "description": "<i>Drag Race Eliminator</i> is a drag racing simulation. In the game the player controls one of 5 different types of drag racing cars and needs to win races against either a human or computer opponent. The player controls the throttle and can shift; depending on which car is being used there are either 2, 3, or 4 gears. The winner of each race is the car to cross the finish line first; the start is signaled by a green light, but if a car starts prior to the green light it is disqualified. The game is intended to be authentic to the sport of drag racing and like the real thing times the races to 1/1000 of a second. The game includes national drag racing records as of the year it was released as the defaults in the high score table; if the player is able to beat any of these records, his name will be added to the list accordingly (it is also possible to restore the list to the defaults).
