  "description": "<i>Gorf</i> is a game that consists of five levels:<ul>\n<li>The first level called <i>Astro Battles</i> has the player's ship behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>.<br><br><li>The second level called <i>Laser Attack</i> is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.</li><br><br><li>The third level is called <i>Galaxians</i>, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Galaxian\">Galaxian</a> with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.</li><br><br><li>The fourth level called <i>Space Warp</i>, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.</li><br><br><li>The fifth and final level is called <i>Flag Ship</i>. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a  weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.</li></ul><br>\nFinishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.",
