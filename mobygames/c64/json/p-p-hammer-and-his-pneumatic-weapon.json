  "description": "In this platform game featuring over 2500 screens, our hero is in search of hidden treasures across worlds such as caves and castles, and must collect it all to advance onto the next level. The twist, as you may guess from the title, is that his weapon is a hammer which can be used to burrow into the ground. The blocks quickly reappear though, which can be fatal if they trap him, but can also be used by the cunning player to trap an enemy. <br><br>Not all the platforms and transporters on the levels are visible, which guarantees an element of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Rick+Dangerous%27\">Rick Dangerous</a>-style trial and error. You have six lives, which isn't much considering that failing to complete a level within the time limit costs a life, and contact with enemies is costly (you can't drill through them <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Worms%27\">Worms</a>-style)",
