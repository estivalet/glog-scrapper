  "description": "<i>Bunny Zap</i> is a top view single screen maze game where you have to move around the screen collecting cosmic creatures while avoiding or shooting bunny's to move to the next level. As you move around the screen, bunny's appear in a warren and move around the screen while you collect the creatures but you are armed with a Hyper-Accurate Bunny Zapping Laser. You can only fire one shot at a time and you can only fire once again if a bullet hits a bunny. If you miss a bunny or just fire then the bullet will keep bouncing off walls until it hits a bunny. If you hit a bunny or touch the walls then you lose one of three lives. Once enough creatures have been collected then you move to the next level but some bunny's now have a shield and can't be shot.",
