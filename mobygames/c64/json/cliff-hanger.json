  "description": "&quot;WANTED: El Bandito Dead or Alive.&quot; Basically you are the super hero trying to kill this bandit. In order to do this, you are given tools like an anvil, a boulder, a bomb, a boomerang, or a cannon. You basically are trying to crush him to go on. This game takes place as if you are acting the entire act out. It is very similar to the road runner and the coyote, the graphics are also very identical.",
