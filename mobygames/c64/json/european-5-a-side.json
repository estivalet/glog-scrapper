  "description": "Five a side football is played indoors, in a walled arena which causes the ball to rebound at an angle when fired against it. This game gives you the chance to play this, either against a friend or the computer. The action is viewed top-down, with a slight angle giving a 3D effect, which is especially noticeable when the ball is in the air. You control the player nearest to the ball, including the goalkeeper once the ball reaches the 6-yard area, and can pass or shoot from any distance. The length of the match can be altered, as can the colour of the pitch.",
