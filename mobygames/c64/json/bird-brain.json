  "description": "Take control of a hungry tropical bird, prowling for a succulent meal while on a break from brooding on her eggs.  Catching that fat fish swimming leisurely in the river below isn't a trivial task: the bird can only be directed by flapping its wings, in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/joust\">Joust</a>, with additional momentum control to the right or left.  Any imprecise movement, and the famished avian may find an untimely demise beneath the waters, or be swept aside by an onrushing wave.<br><br>Once a fish is picked up, it must be brought back to the nest within the time limit, or the bird will die. The quicker your performance, the higher your score, which multiplies with the difficulty level; higher levels speed up the action and make the bird harder to control.",
