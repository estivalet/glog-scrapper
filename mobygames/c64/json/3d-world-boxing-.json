You can play a single match or an entire championship.<br><br>Each match is presented by an announcer and a good looking girl, as  in real matches. The boxers are represented with realistic graphics for the epoch as large on-screen characters. Realistic scoring is awarded for each round.<br><br>There is only one type of punch available, although a 3D ring view results in realistic movement, and head-lock situations can occur.\n",
