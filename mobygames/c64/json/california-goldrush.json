  "description": "In <i>California Goldrush</i>, you control a the miner who navigates a goldfield laying down fences as he goes. There are plots everywhere; and when a fence completely surrounds a plot, it is filled with sacks of gold. The larger the surrounded plot, the greater is the score given. Two Indians give chase to you, but they can be dealt with by laying down dynamite. The dynamite gives off gunpowder residue, making it impossible for anyone to pass through. If one of the Indians touch the miner, a life is lost. When you have completely surrounded all the plots, you will move onto the next goldfield. Future goldfields are inhabited by more Indians who shoot arrows at you. The game ends when you have exhausted all your lives.\n",
