  "description": "<i>Tixo Nim 2</i> is a compilation of two puzzle games. <br><br><i>Tixo</i> is a game taking place on a 22x22 board. One of the players starts by placing a token on the board, in the top row or the rightmost column. The players take turns; during a turn a player can choose to move the token to the left, diagonally bottom-left, or down, by any amount of squares. The winner is the first player to reach the bottom-left square of the board. <br><br><i>Nim 2</i> is an adaptation of the game Nim. There are two groups of tokens, with a random number of tokens in each. The players take turns; during a turn, a player can choose one of the groups, or both, and take any number of tokens. The winner is the player who makes the last move, picking up the last token. ",
