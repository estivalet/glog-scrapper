  "description": "<i>Laced Tiles</i> is a jigsaw puzzle game where players assemble tiles in such a way that they create a picture shown to them when they start each of the ten levels of the game. The tiles can be moved using the joystick. Once they have assembled the tiles correctly, the player is moved on to the next level. Once each level loads, players are given a password so that they can use it to start at that level, should they choose to have a break then come back later. <br><br>",
