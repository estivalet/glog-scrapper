  "description": "This strategical board game is flown between two players and it deals with tiles of two colors. In turns players place tile of their color on the 10x10 board, and if single tile of opposite color is between tiles of player's color, such tile changes it color and becomes player's tile. The goal of the game is to collect the number of your tiles greater than opponent's number until all board will be filled.<br><br>The game may be played versus computer or another player, but additional modes are available for different platforms:\n<ul><li>Demo Mode in C64 version, when computer plays against computer.</li>\n<li>Expert Mode in DOS version, when board is already half-filled.</li></ul>",
