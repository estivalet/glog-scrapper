  "description": "Based on the board game of the same name, two or more players are required to build hotels along a boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The hotels are constructed by placing markers that represent the growing floors of the hotels. The game progresses when players throw three dice, two standard numeric six-sided dice, and a special color die. The two numbers on the standard dice represents the total amount of money players can spend on construction, while the special die tells them that they can build in any color group. During the game, players can take over each other's hotels and get Fortune Cards, in which players can take advantage of construction bonuses, natural disasters, and other events to add and remove floors. As with the board game, the first player to pass $35 million in hotel property values wins the game.",
