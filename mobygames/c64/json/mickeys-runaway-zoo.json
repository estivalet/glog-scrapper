  "description": "In <i>Mickey’s Runaway Zoo</i> both Mickey and Goofy team up to return all of the animals back to the zoo. This is done by a series of screens for young children to start visually identifying numbers incorporated into vivid color landscapes. <br><br>When the child finds a number and presses the matching number on the keyboard, they are rewarded by a quick set of animations. Each animation shows that numeric amount of animals entering the wagon for return to the zoo. ",
