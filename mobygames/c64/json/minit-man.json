  "description": "The aliens robots have invaded, and it is up to the Minit Man to load and fire 3 warheads to defeat the alien forces.  <br><br>First, the aliens have destroyed the bridge required to transport missiles to the launch silos, so the Minit Man must use his helicopter to transport bridge construction material and rebuild the damaged structure.  While he is doing this, he must use his helicopter's powerful laser to stop the robot forces from reaching the launch computer deep within Earth's defense fortress.  If the robots reach the launch computer, it's game over. The player must be careful of enemy attacks, as they only have 5 hits before it's game over.<br><br>After building the bridge, he must protect it from alien assault until a missile has been loaded within the silo.  After this, the Minit Man must land on the roof of the defense fortress and go by foot to the launch computer.  There, he can fire a rocket towards the invading robotic horde.  If the Minit Man can fire 3 rockets, the forces of Earth will be victorious.  ",
