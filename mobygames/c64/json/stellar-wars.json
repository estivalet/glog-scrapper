  "description": "<i>Stellar Wars</i> is a space based shooting game played from a first-person perspective. The player is being attacked by a squadron of stellar fighters and has 100 seconds to shoot as many as possible. The game is played with a joystick which is used to move around a firing sight and to fire the ship's twin lasers as an enemy gets within the sight. If an enemy fighter gets too close the player loses control of the ship and is unable to move or shoot for a few seconds. Firing too much leads to overheating and a temporary inability to fire. Points are scored for each fighter shot down with far away enemies being worth more. Reaching 1,000 and then 3,500 points leads to the player being given 50 extra seconds. The game ends when the time runs out.",
