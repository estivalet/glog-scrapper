  "description": "The Headmaster of a private school has his wallet stolen one day and blames one of the school boys for it. The school boy, who has the reputation of getting into trouble far too many times, must prove his innocence by exploring the school grounds and the nearby town, collecting items and taking them to the right place. \nEach location that the boy visits have names, with some of them providing a clue on the tasks that must be accomplished there. <br><br>A wide variety of items can be collected, and these include a stereo, a cassette tape, a school tie, and a mortar board. Only two items can be carried at a time, and the boy can jump over certain items if he does not want to collect them. <br><br>The school itself is empty, except for deadly objects that float around the room whenever the boy is present and prevent him from getting the required items. Contact with these objects drain the boy's energy, but this energy can be restored by getting food. Once his energy reaches zero, he loses one of his lives. If all his lives are lost, the boy faces expulsion.\n",
