  "description": "The ACG amulet (a reference to Ultimate's formal name of Ashby Computers and Graphics), has been split into four pieces, which are located in different parts of a jungle, and you're the intrepid explorer sent to locate them.<br><br>The game takes place on a large map, and the viewed area often includes section which overlap and can't be reached directly, due to the huge shrubs and trees which are used as borders.<br><br>The gameplay has many similarities to Ultimate's earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Atic+Atac\">Atic Atac</a> title (even though they charged almost twice as much for it). It combines shooting (creatures such as spiders and hippos are among the many ferocious delights on show), and puzzle solving, largely involving manoeuvring objects. Once you run out of lives, the game tells you the percentage completed; chances are you'll be surprised that hours of exploration only cover half of it.",
