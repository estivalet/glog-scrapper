  "description": "With 8 circuits to race on against 2 opponents (one of which can also be human-controlled), this racing game is viewed from above and resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a> and early budget-price imitations such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Grand+Prix+Simulator\">Grand Prix Simulator</a>. Tracks can be raced in the wet, dry or on ice - don't forget to alter the tyre selection to suit. Contact with other cars weakens these tyres and can eventually cause punctures. Each race is of a varying number of laps depending on the track's length and complexity. Sound effects have been sampled, giving the game a realistic sound unusual at the time.",
