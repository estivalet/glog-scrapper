  "description": "This is a very short and simple EGA game that helps children estimate what animals are bigger or smaller than each other.  A series of zoo animals are shown, two per screen, and the question of which is bigger or smaller is given and the player presses the 1 or 2 keys and gets feedback on correctness.  After 10 screens of &quot;weighed&quot; animals, the player is given his/her total score.",
