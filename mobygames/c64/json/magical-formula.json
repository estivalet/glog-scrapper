  "description": "Hundreds of years ago when snails still dwelled the Earth, Sonny the Snail lived happily with his parents in a place called Snail Meadow, and he was about to marry Dawny, his snailgirl of his dreams. All his happiness came to an end one day when troops of evil skeletons invaded Snail Meadow, robbed each house, killed their cattle, and kidnapped the snailwomen. After seeing Snail Meadow living in big sorrow, a wizardsnail decided to help them, but in order to do so, he needed several magic items - which include scrolls, mushrooms, money bags, and bag of coins - so that he can create his magical formula used to help track down the snailmates. He sends Sonny to collect these items.<br><br>While Sonny is busy collecting these items placed, he must deal with a wide variety of enemies - including enemy snails, green aliens, rotating skulls, balls, and bombs – by throwing slime at them. Furthermore, he must avoid the acid rain dripping from platforms. If Sonny comes into contact with any of the inhabitants or the acid rain, he loses one of his lives. When destroyed, some enemies leave behind certain power-ups that award Sonny with extra lives, time, or points. Occasionally, Sonny must destroy “huge enemies” including a cloud that throws lightning at him and two huge brains, and a skull named Freddy Snailcracker. Once Sonny has collected enough magical items, he proceeds to the next environment.",
