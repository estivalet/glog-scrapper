  "description": "<em>Sum Ducks</em> is an educational game for children ages 8-12.<br><br>In the game there is a pool with several ducks swimming around, each duck marked with a number. You are given a target number shown on the scoreboard at the top of the screen. As the ducks swim by, you can toss a ring around a duck which will cause its number to be added to the equation on the scoreboard. Your goal is to create an equation which results in the target number (you need to be exact and can't be over or under). Depending on the game variation, you need to reach the target via addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For example, in the addition game you might be given a target of 50; if you toss a ring around 5 ducks each marked with a 10 then you win that round.<br><br>Sometimes the ducks can be tricky and may poke their head in the water; if that duck has a number you need, you will first need to toss a ring at the duck to bring his head back up. Also in the division game, if you ring a duck which has a number that is not a factor of the target, then that duck will dive underwater until the next game. In addition to the ducks, from time to time a hippo will appear in the water and offer a number; sometimes this may help you out, if so you can toss a ring to the hippo for the number. The game features both easy and difficult skill levels.",
