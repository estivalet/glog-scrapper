  "description": "The 1986 cult film Highlander is the basis of this adaptation, which reduces the film to its swordfighting scenes. Taking the role of the immortal Highlander Connor MacLeod, the player has to win three consecutive battles against increasingly skilled opponents: MacLeod's teacher Ramirez, a character named Fizir, and finally the mighty Kurgan, the main antagonist of the movie.<br><br>A battle is won by depleting the enemy of his energy. Energy is lost by being hit, or by attempting an attack that is blocked by the enemy. To win, a combination of attacking and parrying moves is necessary, of which several are available depending on the character's stance (standing or crouched) and the direction the joystick is pushed.<br><br>Two players can engage in a duel in two-player mode.",
