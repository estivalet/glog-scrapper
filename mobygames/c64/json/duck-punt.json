  "description": "By the time you've read the name and appreciated <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Duck+Hunt\">the pun</a>, you've already achieved an understanding of half of this game's appeal.  From there, little is left to the imagination: two teams on an American football field take turns with possession of a duck (rubber, presumably, given the distances achieved) attempting to kick it (as the author ad-libs, a <i>fowl ball</i>) to the goal line... and victory!<br><br>In the C64 original you would specify the short or long punt, so as to not drastically overshoot near the goal line and be forced to buy a new duck with a point deduction.  Also, sporadically the game would declare that an interception had occurred (or, steady yourselves, an ab-<i>duck</i>-tion).<br><br><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Duck+Punt+%282005%29\">A modern remake</a> has been produced for contemporary operating environments with numerous interface and gameplay enhancements.",
