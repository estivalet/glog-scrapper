  "description": "In <i>Captron</i> you are a hunter for werewolves. From level to level you compose four nets from four parts each, dropping the parts to the bottom of playfield. To drop the part, you should pass over it, or drop another part on it. Werewolves are also in the playfield, and each contact with them means decrease of your lives. Dropping the part over the werewolf means his death and rebirth of another werewolf to kill you. To stop the werewolf you may set the dummy (blocker), which quantity is limited. Blockers appear on the playfield and may be collected. The quantity of werewolves, and the playfield shape's difficulty is increased with the level's number. The best scores are stored in high score table.",
