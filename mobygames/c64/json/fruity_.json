  "description": "<i>Fruity</i> is a side view single screen game where you have to collect fruit from the trees using your 'Ultra Powerful' trampoline to reach the high parts of the trees to collect the fruit. You move the trampoline left or right on the bottom of the screen and you press fire to bounce higher. As you collect fruit a vulture flies across the top of the screen and sits sometimes in the top of one of the trees and if you hit it then you are carried away and a loss of one of four lives. If you hit the ground then you also lose a life and the screen is completed once you collect all the fruit and you move to the next screen with a new type of fruit.",
