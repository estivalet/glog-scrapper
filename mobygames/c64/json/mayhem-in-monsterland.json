  "description": "Mayhem is an unhappy dinosaur, as Monsterland is an unhappy place, due to an apprentice magic dinosaur who decided to practice some of his master's spells, after drinking too much cactus juice.  Mayhem decides to change it back, with the help of Theo Saurus, the apprentice responsible for Monsterland being the gloomy place it is now.<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling platform game, where you play the part of Mayhem.  You can kill enemies by jumping on them.<br><br>There are five levels in the game.  Each one starts in unhappy mode, where Mayhem must collect enough bags of magic dust, from the enemies you face, then find your way to Theo's hidden cave.  Theo then uses the dust to make the level happy again.  This change is reflected in the more jazzy music, colourful landscape and even the monsters who look more friendly and cheerful.<br><br>Some of the magic, however, clumps together into magical stars, that Mayhem must collect, on the happy version of the level, to stop them falling into the wrong hands.  There is a quota of stars that Mayhem must collect, before going over the finishing line. <br><br>In the happy version of the level there are more bonuses that can be collected, such as score multipliers, extra lives, extra time, etc.  The most important is probably the ability to charge, allowing Mayhem to run very fast, killing any enemies in his way.  Also, he stops with a skid, and extra points are awarded for a long skid over the finishing line. ",
