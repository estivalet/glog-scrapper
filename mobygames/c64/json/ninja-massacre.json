  "description": "<i>Ninja Massacre</i> is a 1 or 2 player <i>Gauntlet</i> clone. As a ninja you must move around a maze collecting treasure, power-ups and killing all baddies. There are 50 levels to complete with a password after each one so you don't have to start at level one again. In 2 player mode both you and the other player play at the same time.<br><br>The game is viewed from above but with the ninjas and baddies viewed from the side. A small part of the maze is shown at a time, scrolling as you move around. The joystick moves your ninja while the fire button throws your ninja stars. The keyboard can also be used.",
