  "description": "<i>Patience</i> (also known as Solitaire), is a version of the famous card game for one player where the aim is to make four piles of cards of the same suit starting from the Ace to King in order. The player has seven columns of cards, with the far right column having just one card showing its value and the rest of the columns having one more card than the column on the right with the top card's value shown. The far left column has seven cards and there is also a pile of cards that are not in the columns. Cards can now be moved into other columns but cards can only be placed on a card a different colour and one value higher. If a column of cards are in this sequence then all them cards can be moved. Any Aces are moved to the side and then two, three etc can be placed on the Ace with the same suit. When no more cards cannot be moved then you can start dealing the cards from the pile on the side. Three cards are removed and the third card is shown and it can be placed on the columns or the Ace piles if applicable. If the card cannot be played then three more cards are taken from the pile and the third card looked at. Any cards not used are placed on the new pile and the player keeps repeating until all four piles have been placed or there are no more moves.",
