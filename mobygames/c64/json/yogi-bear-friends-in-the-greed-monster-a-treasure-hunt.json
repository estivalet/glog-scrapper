  "description": "All the toys in the World have been stolen by the Greed Monster, so Top Cat has sent Yogi's Treasure Hunters to find them all. Problem is, all the hunters have been captured by the monster except Yogi, so it's up to Yogi to find his friends and all the toys. The game is a flick-screen maze game viewed from a high elevated angle as you control Yogi. <br><br>You have to search the surrounding areas looking for your friends and toys while avoiding or shooting various creatures. You are armed with sweets to shoot the creatures but these are limited. If you are touched by a creature or certain obstacles then you lose part of a food gauge and when this is empty then it is game over. As well as the toys and your friends, there are other items that can be collected and they are coloured keys to open the same coloured door, cans of pop to double your speed, extra sweets and jars of honey to make you invincible for a limited period. Bubble gum needs avoiding as these will stick you to the spot for a limited time.",
