  "description": "Return to Mordor, where a dull red sky is filled with the dust and heat of Mount Doom.  Brave the ash-covered wastelands of Gorgoroth, the blood-splashed courtyards in the Tower of Cirith Ungol, and a horrifying torture chamber guarded by grinning, brutal orcs.\nIn this adventure you will be playing as Sam Gamgee and will begin outside the gates of Cirith Ungol.  Dare you enter the Tower and try to save your beloved master, Frodo?  Or should you somehow try to complete the quest alone, and hurl the Ring of Power into the fires of Mount Doom?  ",
