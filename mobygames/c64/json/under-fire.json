  "description": "Under Fire is a tactical simulation of WW II land combat. Men and weapons from the United States, Germany and Russia are represented. There are nine scenarios in the game which range from open field firefights to house to house conflict. Victory is a subjective affair in Under Fire as there is no declaration of victory. The victory screen basically tallies up losses and objectives gained the rest is left to argument. Under Fire can be played by one or two players. Playing time can range from 10 minutes for a two squad battle to five hours  for a 32 squad firefight.",
