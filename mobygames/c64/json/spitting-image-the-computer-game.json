  "description": "This game is based on the long-running British satirical television show with puppet likenesses of political figures and celebrities.  A prophet determines that a world war will occur in seven years instigated by a mysterious leader.  To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II.<br><br>Having chosen which to play as, you travel to an opponent's country to engage in a best-of-three fight that is judged by Queen Elizabeth II on a postage stamp.  You attack each opponent on the ground as well as jumping in the air and each character has a special move like Thatcher's head-butt or Khomeini's beard whip.  You can also call for help twice from an aide who will usually throw a projectile at your opponent.\n  \nIf you manage to defeat all 5 opponents, you will meet the mysterious leader in a final showdown in a mud-wrestling pit in the dark where you will only be able to see the eyes of the characters.  You can also play 2-player fights, one against another on the same computer.",
