  "description": "<i>Crystal Caverns</i> is a text-based adventure game for multiple systems.<br><br>The player arrived in front of an old Victorian mansion deep within the woods.  Their goal is to search the forest and outlying buildings that surround the great house, and return all the treasures they find to the cupola of the house.  Gameplay is via VERB NOUN text commands, and the player must map the world by hand.  As the player explores the grounds, they find a hole which they can dig into the caverns that stretch far below the mansion.  In these great caverns, a number of treasures, including: gold toothpicks, a sapphire, a painting, a ring, and more can be discovered.  All of these must be returned to the mansion for the player to complete the game.  The player must use care while exploring, as the wrong move can result in the death of the player.<br><br>At the end of each game, the player is awarded points for the number of areas they explored, turns used, and treasures recovered.<br><br>",
