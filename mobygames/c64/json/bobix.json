  "description": "Bobix lives a quiet and peaceful life as an apprentice magician on the island Texul. After the Queen of the island falls sick and dies, Bobix discovers that the magician Bennof, his teacher, is actually an impostor who has poisoned the queen. Because Bobix tried to warn the palace guards, Bennof kidnapped Bobette and fled to another island. In order to rescue Bobette, Bobix needs to find four magic potions on four different islands.<br><br><i>Bobix</i> is a sidescrolling platformer. Jump over platforms and obstacles and kill hostile animals with a short ranged spell. Every island consists of several sub-levels. In every sub-level you must collect all bottles and enough diamonds to rent a boat. After all sub-levels are completed you take a boat to the next island. During these portion of the game, which are seen from a top-down perspective, you can collect balloons to gain extra points. Collecting the balloons is made difficult by the changing direction of the wind. As the game progresses the challenges become more difficult and the enemies more resilient; they will even try to dodge your attacks.",
