  "description": "<i>Time Trucker</i> is an educational game that teaches time skills to the player. The player drives a truck and has to pick up produce at farms and deliver it to a depot. The game has three different maps, and the player navigates around them from a over head perspective. The first map is printed in the manual while the other two are secret and the player has to figure out the right routes. The third map also has road repairs that blocks the path. Before starting out it's possible to choose between a male or female trucker although this does not affect the gameplay.<br><br>There are three different difficulties and the objectives differ in each. In the easiest one the player has to deliver as many orders as possible in eight hours. When arriving at a farm the player has to read the analogue clock and enter it correctly on a digital clock. If not successful the player won't earn any money on that order. The middle difficulty involves delivering a complete order every two hours to earn a bonus. Here the time does not have to be entered but it's necessary to arrive within the right time intervals. On the hardest level farms are only open for fifteen minutes. Both of the two later levels uses a 24-hour clock while the easy one uses a 12-hour clock.",
