  "description": "In this early UK-developed baseball simulation, one or two player matches can be played over 3,6 or 9 innings, with 3 different computer skill levels. The rules are explained by some introductory screens, and the game is fully faithful to these. Gameplay is in an arcade/action style, so you don't need to worry about statistics for different teams or players. <br><br>The main viewing area is a forced-perspective view of the field, with a small side-viewed window of the pitcher's delivery itself. When fielding, control automatically goes to the player nearest to the ball, but a point doesn't end until the pitcher has the ball back (unless it is a home run). Features include stealing bases, pitching curve balls, or customizing the colors of each team.<br><br>The game has been presented with considerable glitz, with cheerleaders on screen between innings and lots of advertising boards and other slogans.",
