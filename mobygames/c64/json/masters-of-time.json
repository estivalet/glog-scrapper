As the player explores this field, they are attacked by timeguards and timebombs which sap their energy.  When the player's energy runs low, they must enter the intertimelevel to arrive back at the present date.  <br><br>Upon arriving to the present date, the player must correctly remember the facts they previously received.  Completing this task, the player's energy is refilled, and they go out in search of more historical facts.",
