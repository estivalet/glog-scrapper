Many men have set out to become rich but none have returned with few actually reaching the pyramid itself.

If you make it there will be puzzles, traps and creatures waiting for you.<br><br><i>The Pyramid</i> is a text adventure where text describes each location and you type commands with the keyboard to control your hero and interact with each location.",
