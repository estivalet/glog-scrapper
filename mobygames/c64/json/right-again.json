  "description": "<i>Right Again</i> is a biblical themed guessing game.<br><br>The player must guess a person, place, or item from the bible, given a number of distinct clues derived from 4 different mini-games.  In the first mini-game, the player plays charades with an angel to determine what thing they are guessing.  They start with guessing person, place, or thing, and are then given further hints such as gender or whether animal, vegetable, or mineral.  In the second mini-game, the player controls an angel standing below a librarian who moves across a rack of chapters from the Bible.  The librarian will throw books up in the air, and the angel must catch them.  With each successful clue, the player is given a hint to narrow down which book the secret object is from.  In the third mini-game, the player must fly an angel over a map of the Holy Land, while avoiding clouds.  When the player finds the right city, they are told this is where the answer occurred.  In the final mini-game, the player must fly an angel over multiple time periods, receiving clues from characters from the Bible at that time, to finally track down the correct Biblical period the answer was mentioned.  After solving all 4 mini-games, the player can attempt to guess the thing from the bible all the clues lead to.  The goal is to minimize the number of turns required to solve the puzzle.",
