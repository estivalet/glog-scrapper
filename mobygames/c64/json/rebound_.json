  "description": "<i>Rebound</i> is an arcade game in which the player must place deflectors to guide a ball to as many targets as possible within a given time limit. The game is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/deflection\">Deflection</a>, only instead of a limited number of targets there is a time limit. New targets will continuously spawn and the player must hit as many as possible within two minutes. The player can place / and \\ deflectors, which will bounce the ball in a direction (based on the side from which the ball hits). When pressing a special button at the exact moment the ball collides with a deflector removes the deflector from play.",
