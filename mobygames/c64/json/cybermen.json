  "description": "After battling Meanies in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bonka\">Bonka</a>, you must now fight against <i>Cybermen</i> to collect as much Platignum as you can from a Cosmic Space Station in this flick-screen top view maze game. Each screen has various numbers of Cybermen programmed to protect the Platignum from intruders, and they must be avoided or shot while you escape through various open doors on the edge of the screen. The Platignum is randomly placed around the station so some screens contains it while others don't and you can't go back the way you came once you go through a door. If you stay on a level for too long then a Overseer appears and is indestructible so you must leave the screen to lose it. If you are shot, touch a Cyberman or Overseer, or touch the walls then you lose one of three lives. ",
