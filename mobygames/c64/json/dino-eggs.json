He has to return the Dino eggs to the present time in order to save them from this epidemic. Tim has to face the dino egg predators, such as spiders and snakes which will contaminate the eggs. The mother of the eggs also lurks by, and if a fire is not built, she may just step in. Will you be able to save the dinosaur race from extinction?",
