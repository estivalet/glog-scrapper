  "description": "In the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/inheritance-panic-in-las-vegas\">The Inheritance: Panic in Las Vegas</a> you've found yourself in Scotland. Your Aunt has donated her castle, but alas, you must prove your identity. Your family book is somewhere in this castle and &quot;false nephews&quot; are popping up everywhere. What a chaos!<br><br>As its predecessor, the game is played in first-person view with point-and-click interface. The player moves a cursor in the screen with the ARROW KEYS, and interacts with objects by pressing the ACTION key. Inventory is now limited to 4 items and moved to the bottom of the screen. The game now consists of single load, but to make it more difficult a percentage of your hungriness is introduced to the game. It is equal to 99% at the beginning and is decreasing with time flow. You should keep an eye on it and fill it, eating food found in the castle. <br><br>During the game, you, Mr. Peter Stone, will interact with different persons and collect/use different items. Some of your actions may be lethal for the others, but you should also keep your alive and get your Inheritance finally.",
