You can control the speed of your ship and the screen scrolls when you move as well as turn and fly the other way and you will need to turn if you reach the end of the level and you haven't destroyed enough of the scenery. There are various icons and they can affect your ship like destroy your ship or reverse the controls. <br><br>The second stage is a simple shoot-em-up where you shoot or avoid waves of ships as you from move left to right with the screen scrolling constantly. You can't turn or control your speed. The final stage will see you face an end of level boss. Destroy the boss and it's of to the next level.
