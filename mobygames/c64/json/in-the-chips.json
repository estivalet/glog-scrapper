  "description": "A business simulator which puts you in control of a Silicon Valley software firm: you've invested $100,000 in cash in the business, and now you get to call the shots. Your goal is to expand your share of the computer software market while striving against a competing company (run by the computer or by another human player).<br><br>Each turn represents a fiscal quarter, and both companies set up a business strategy. This is done by walking your character between the company's various buildings: at R&amp;D, development budget is assigned for up to five potential products (games, judging by their titles). Stock levels are set at Manufacturing, and retail prices are adjusted in the Sales office. Then there's Advertising, which will (literally) reach out its hand for budget. <br><br>These factors, along with your opponent's tactics, will determine your market performance - when the next quarter rolls in, you receive a financial report, and can redivide the pie accordingly. To win, you will have to balance supply and demand, read the market correctly and counter the competition's strategy. The length of the game (in quarters) is adjustable, and there's also a Monopoly mode, where both sides can try to corner the market by setting prices at below cost.",
