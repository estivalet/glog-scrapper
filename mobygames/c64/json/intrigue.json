  "description": "A film-noir detective mystery set in Washington D.C. featuring real-world locations and almost real-world actors in the roles.  <br><br>Your detective brother Joe has gone missing while investigating a plot to release a virus into the D.C. air leaving you to try to pick up where he left off.  By interviewing suspects (who look just different enough from old movie stars to avoid a lawsuit), piecing together clues, and following leads you must discover the location of the villains hideout, deactivate the virus spreading device, and correctly identify the mastermind behind the plot.  Each time you play, the criminal and clues change so you can never be sure who to trust and where you will be going (the box boasts over 2000 possible solutions).\n",
