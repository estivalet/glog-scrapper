After getting relieved of your post at the Port Foozle Inquisition Gift Kiosk, you see the Pastor of Disaster, the Minister of Sinister, the Grand Inquisitor. It looks like he has a job for you. Yes, you. After asking about other, ANY other, guards to go instead, you have your orders. Sigh. Very well. Archaeologists have unearthed a tunnel that seems to lead to a new section of the Great Underground Empire or GUE. You are to  enter this tunnel and explore the Great Underground Empire. You'll be back in no time. You hope.",
