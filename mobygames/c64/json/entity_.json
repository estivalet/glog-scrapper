  "description": "<i>Entity</i> recreates a solitaire puzzle game originating in Victorian England. Played on a grid of 17 squares, arranged as a pair of overlapping 3x3 diamonds. There are 8 white tiles and 8 black tiles, with a single space at all times. At the start, the space seperates the white tiles on the left from the black tiles on the right - the player's objective is to move the tiles so as to reverse this, leaving the black tiles on the left and the white tiles on the right. <br><br>Tiles can be moved one space into the gap, or can jump directly over a tile to land in the gap. However, they must be at a right-angle to the space, not on an opposite corner. The all-time record is 46 moves; a simulation of this game is included on the disk.",
