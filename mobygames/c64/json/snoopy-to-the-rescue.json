  "description": "<i>Snoopy to the Rescue</i> is a 1 - 2 player side-scrolling arcade game featuring the comic character Snoopy.<br><br>Snoopy needs to save Woodstock from a castle where he is trapped.  A side-scrolling arcade game, the player can move left and right, as well as jump.  Gameplay consists of multiple stages, where the goal is to climb to the top left corner of the screen.   On each level, there are a number of timers, and the player must stop each timer so that their total equals the number displayed on the top of the screen on each level, otherwise Snoopy dies when he reaches the end of the level.  Keys are found on each level, and when the player collects a key, the nearest enemy briefly turns orange and stop moving.  The player must run into the enemy at this time to destroy them, or the level becomes unbeatable.  Other dangers include water, and if Snoopy falls too far, he dies.  Each player starts with 5 lives, and when the lives are lost it's game over. \n",
