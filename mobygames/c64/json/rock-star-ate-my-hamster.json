  "description": "The player takes the role of Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. They must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once the player has chosen their artists then they have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand, or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but the player might pay for their choice later on in the game.<br><br>To make the group a star the player has options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for their stars. Each action choosen advances the calendar by one day. The player has until December to achieve their ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of the band's releases.<br><br>Once the player's band has recorded their first album the player can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director is chosen to direct it. The player can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of the rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend the gigs. The player loses the game if either they run out of money or all of their rock stars die.",
