  "description": "In <i>Miner!</i> the player's goal is to earn as much money as possible. To do this the player must mine for gold and sell when gold prices are high. The game uses a side view and the player owns a mine with an elevator that can be sent to various levels. The player can dig through the soil removing block by block. When digging there are various surprises the player can encounter. The most important is of course gold, but others like impenetrable granite, cave-ins, easily dug-out sandstone and loose footings will also be encountered by the player.<br><br>Outside of the mine the player can sell the gold he or she found. Gold prices fluctuate, so the player can try to find the best moment for selling. Each digging action the player undertakes costs money, so the player cannot wait too long or the mining operation will go bankrupt.",
