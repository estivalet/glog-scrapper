  "description": "2000AD hero Nemesis must defeat the evil Torquemada, the Grand Master of Termight, and the hordes of Terminators he has dispatched. The game is set on a succession of 30 single-screen levels comprising of networks of platforms. You are armed with a gun (with limited ammunition) and a sword, and must kill a set amount of Terminators on each level. Terminators follow a set pattern, so you can work out which ledges they will reach next. Dead Terminators remain on the screen - when you are not doing well, Torquemada can sometimes turn these into vicious scythe-wielding zombies.<br><br>To get to the exit players will often have to pile up their opponents' dead bodies to reach higher platforms.",
