  "description": "A Princess has been kidnapped and it is up to a pair of robots called Jim and Bob to go and rescue her over various levels. <i>Deliverance</i> is a platform game where the screen scrolls constantly from left to right as you navigate platforms, avoid obstacles and either shoot or avoid other creatures. If you touch an obstacle or creature, or get trapped when the screen catches you up then you lose one of five lives. As well as the main playing area, there is also a radar showing how far you have to travel to reach the end of the level. One or two players can play and both players are on the screen at the same time but don't interact with each other.",
