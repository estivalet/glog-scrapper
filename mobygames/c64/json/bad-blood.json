  "description": "A nuclear war has turned the world into a wasteland. The pure-blooded humans have retreated in large cities while mutants live in small villages on the plains where they make a living by hunting the many monsters. Now one of the human leaders, Lord Dominix, wants to start a war to wipe out all the &quot;bad-blooded&quot; mutants. Your village chief has assigned you with the task of preventing this war.<br><br><i>Bad Blood</i> is a top-down action game with light role-playing elements. You can not create your own character but have to pick one of the three predefined ones: Varrigg (a strong green mutant who fights with his bare hands), Dekker (a human male armed with a knife) or Jakka (she looks human but can shoot laser beams from her eyes like Cyclops of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=X-Men+licensees\">X-Men</a> fame). The choice you make has only a limited impact on gameplay and storyline.<br><br>Gameplay consists of exploring the world map, visiting several cities and villages, talking with NPCs, picking up items and new weapons (like shotguns, grenades, Uzis etc.) and lots of real-time combat. <i>Bad Blood</i> lacks character stats and character development. The game has a day-night cycle which influences the amount of monsters on the plains and whether or not you can talk with some NPCs.",
