  "description": "The Refuge Assurance English county cricket championship provides the basis of this managerial recreation of the sport. Options are selected using nested text-based windows.<br><br>The range of options you have is similar to football management games; select your team of 11 from an initial squad of 16, based on their batting and bowling skills. New players can be brought in for money.<br><br>During the match, you choose the bowlers for each over, and the fielding positions, although bowlers are not divided into fast/medium/spin, so you will not find yourself altering these too often. Matches involve a single innings of unlimited length.",
