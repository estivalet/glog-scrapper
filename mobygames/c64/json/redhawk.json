  "description": "By shouting 'Kwah!' ordinary Kevin Oliver can transform himself into superhero Redhawk, a power you must use in this cartoon adventure. As you travel the city you must pay attention to your popularity ratings - you can play the game either to perform good or evil. <br><br>The game uses a text parser with a vocabulary allowing for actions such as walking, looking around, arresting people, hitting them, using objects, or waiting in a set position for a set amount of time - every action sees time get used up. Standard input methods such as using AND or commas to delimit multiple commands, and leaving out words like THE and SOME are implemented.<br><br>Being in Redhawk mode uses up energy, so this must be used sparingly.The screen display is in comic book style, with the last 3 drawings on screen at each time.",
