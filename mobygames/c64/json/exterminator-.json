  "description": "Of all the mundane tasks which've been turned into action-packed games, bug-repelling must be up there with being a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Paperboy%27\">Paper Boy</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Trashman%27\">Trashman</a>. These aren't average bugs; Chicago is under siege from mutated insects, rats and even toy tanks.<br><br>You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.",
