  "description": "For many years this was the only squash game in existence, and it's licensed by one of the top stars of the 80s. Jonah calls the score, and claimed that the program could boost a player's squash skills, as well as provide entertainment.<br><br><em>Jonah Barrington's Squash</em> features one and two player modes, with 4 difficulty levels. Accurate rebounds are implemented, and the ball's bounce is visible from its shadow. Realistic tactics appear to produce the correct effects, in terms of playing attacking or defensive.",
