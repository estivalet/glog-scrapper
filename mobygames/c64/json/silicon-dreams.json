When you are awakened prematurely from hibernation, you know something's wrong!<br><br><b>Return to Eden:</b> Your objective is to get into the new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.<br><br><b>Worm in Paradise:</b> You have to find as much information about the city as possible, obtain money, and then become a member of the governing party of Eden.",
