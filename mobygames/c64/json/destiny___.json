  "description": "<i>Destiny</i> is a fantasy-themed graphic adventure game with RPG elements<br><br>Deep within a craggy, mountainous area of Adventure, guarded by Orcan warriors, stands the fortress of the once great and benevolent ruler, King Ecreip III.  The noble king had no heirs, thus shortly before his death decreed that all his lands shall go to the man who slays the invincible red dragon Faldakrin who threatens Adventura.  Faldakrin has now taken up residence in the great fortress, and is guarded by the invasive Orcans.  Your mission is to slay the dragon, but be warned, only one other has attempted this quest, and Sir Marcos Dracos has not been seen since.<br><br>The game is played via game cursor, and all available commands are on the right hand side of the screen.  The player moves by selecting north, south, east, or west.  The player must select individual areas of the screen in order to search or look at objects.  Graphical display of the player's location appears on the main screen.<br><br>There is a basic combat system, where the player can attack, try to run away, or offer gold to the monster.  The enemy monsters will either attack or attempt to flee each round.  Attack power is based upon the player's weapon, armor, and shield.  Each monster has an attack rating, and every attack can be either mild, moderate, or severe, which respectively do 1x, 2x, or 3x the character's attack rating.  The player is awarded gold for winning battles, which can be used to heal at the local inn or buy better equipment.   As time progresses, the player will age.",
