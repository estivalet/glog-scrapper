  "description": "Wally Week has become trapped inside one of his own nightmares, and is in danger of failing to wake up from it in time for work at the car factory. Only you can save him from the inevitable sack, by finding the key that can be used to bring your alarm clock to life.<br><br>The world inside his head is large and varied, with escalators, lifts and locked doors used to navigate it. Only two objects can be carried at a time, but some must be used in tandem, and others only become active when you walk over them while carrying one or two items they require to become active. <br><br>As this is a nightmare world, not everything is as it seems - everything is enlarged, and axes, punching hands and ghosts are all out to get you. Your energy is measured by a 'Snooze Energy' meter depicted by a glass of milk - once this drops to minimum, one of your 3 lives is lost.",
