  "description": "<i>Plato's Cave</i> is an educational game for the Commodore 64.<br><br>The player fires a laser from any position into the border of maze that can measure from 3 x 3 - 13 x 13. Within the maze there are user-defined number of hidden items including reflections to the right, reflections to the left, mirrors, positions that absorb, and simply empty squares.  The player must determine the location and type of all items by firing a laser and determining its exit point. The player then receives a score based upon how accurately they define the maze.  The game keeps track of entry and exit points, and can receive hints if stuck.\n",
