  "description": "<i>The Further Adventures of Alice in Videoland</i> is the sequel to the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/alice-in-videoland\">Alice in Videoland</a> based on the Lewis Carroll character from the classic novel Alice in Wonderland. The game sees Alice playing with her cat in her house before entering a magical mirror to a strange world. Outside her house, Alice finds a pathway which is viewed from the side at an elevated angle, and as she walks along the path from the left to right the screen scrolls as she moves. On her walk down the path, Alice encounters Dragons and a number of these can be destroyed by touching them but after a certain number, Alice will lose one of six lives if she touches anymore.  Also moving on the path are doors and these need jumping over and if she touches one then she appears back outside her house. The game allows up to four players to play and there are nine skill levels to choose from (1-9). <br><br>The original game Bug-Byte have re-released this from consisted of four different scenes to play and came on disk from Audiogenic Software Limited. The problem players found was when they reached the end of the first scene the C64 thought the game was still on disk instead of cassette and tries to load the next scene but fails to do so. After a couple of attempts the C64 would reset. ",
