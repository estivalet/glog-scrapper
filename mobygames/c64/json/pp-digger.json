  "description": "This is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/boulder-dash\">Boulder Dash</a> clone, where players has to collect a number of diamonds before time runs out. Boulders (or “rockstones”, as the game describes them) scattered throughout each room can be used to the player's advantage. Removing the earth in which boulders rest cause these boulders to fall down until they hit the next piece of earth, creating a path in which the player can navigate to other areas by. Also, boulders can be used to crush any pumpkins and ghosts that are nearby.<br><br>Other obstacles include changers and destructible walls. Changers create diamonds if boulders are placed on top of them, and destructible walls need to be destroyed in order to access passages that were previously sealed. Once players collect the last required diamond, they can proceed to the next room where more diamonds await them.",
