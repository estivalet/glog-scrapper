  "description": "Steel Thunder offers multiple theaters in which to do battle ranging from Cuba to Europe.  While actually in the tank, the player can easily move from the position of Commander to Gunner or Driver, offering a significant degree of realism, but still keeping the action moving.  You can simply stay in the Commander's seat, and give commands to the Driver and Gunner and just watch the action as it plays out, although only from the internal views.<br><br>As play progresses, the player also increases his rank.  The initial mission set-up screen offers the player multiple tanks ranging from the Bradley to the M1A1.  In addition to this, the player can also choose specific crew members and see their respective &quot;grade&quot; regarding their performance characteristics.",
