  "description": "The land of EggBugg is threatened by the evil witch, and the wizard has asked his bubble to collect all the rainbows throughout the land, and bring them back to his lab to be mixed into a potion that could destroy the witch. The bubble can only collect 20 rainbows at once, so multiple trips to the lab are necessary.<br><br>The witch has placed many creatures throughout the land, and they will hurt the bubble upon contact; so to make getting the rainbows easier, the wizard has equipped with a limited supply of stars - capable of shooting in three directions – which can be used to defeat the creatures. If the bubble has no stars, then it can jump over the creatures. As well as rainbows, various items can be collected that will award the bubble with more points, stamina, or stars.<br><br>",
