  "description": "<i>Laurel &amp; Hardy</i> stars the two famous comedians in their quest to throw cream cakes in each others face. The interface is divided into three horizontal parts: the middle one shows the match statistics and the possessions while the other two represent the town from the side. <br><br>The first order of business is finding the cream cake shop to get ammo. For finding the way in the big city, it is recommended to purchase a map. Various items on the way may help or bring disadvantages, e.g. a bike to become faster (but are forbidden in certain parts of the city) and liquor bottles (soda is good and beer is bad). After a successful hit a point is rewarded and after one has a certain number of points (can be specified before starting the match) he wins. ",
