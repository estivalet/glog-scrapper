  "description": "<i>Delta Man</i> is an action adventure game for the Commodore 64.<br><br>It's the year 2027, and you are a newspaper reporter, and one of possibly only a handful of humans left alive following a nuclear holocaust which has reduced the city of Chicago to a smoldering poisonous ruin.  You have survived because you discovered an experimental, high-tech robotic space suit which, at least for the time being, protects you from the terminally toxic atmosphere and lets you move freely about the city.  <br><br>Played from a 1st person perspective via the helmet of the suit, the player can move via different rooms.  The player must make their base in the partially destroyed O'Hare airport, while trying to stay alive by gathering items from the wrecked city.  Dangers including radiation, extreme temperatures, and toxins are a constant risk to the player.   The player must find weapons to defend themselves from the mutated remnants of Chicago's population.  The ultimate goal is to amass enough supplies and fuel to escape Chicago and reach the Mount Mitchell broadcasting station in North Carolina where humans are still broadcasting live.  <br><br>",
