  "description": "You are Archangel Bertram and you are on a mission from heaven into the depths of hell to get back the Ten Commandments stolen by Mephisto. To make you more angry and determined, Mephisto also stole your horn. You start outside the gates of Hell and you must go deeper and deeper into the depths and confront Mephisto and destroy him. <br><br>In this platform and maze game where the screen scrolls when you move, you must shoot various nasties with your halo and jump pits of spikes and lava over various levels. If you touch a nasty then he drains some of your energy and if it reaches zero or you touch spikes and lava then you lose one of 8 lives. Occasionally you come across a bible which can restore some energy. At the end of a level is a boss and when defeated you get a Commandment back. <br><br>As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, lives, commandments collected and lives. A joystick is used to control Bertram.",
