  "description": "In this 1st person perspective game, you must control a <i>Kayak</i> and race it down various river courses in the fastest time possible. On each course are gates in various positions down the river and you must steer your craft through them with the white pole always on your left. As well as steering your craft left or right you can speed up or slow down as well. If you navigate through a gate without touching it then a black square appears in the top left of the screen, but if you touch a pole then a white square appears. Miss a gate altogether and no square appears but you add a time penalty to your time. Also on the river are currents and if you touch these then your craft changes direction.",
