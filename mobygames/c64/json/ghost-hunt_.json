  "description": "<i>Ghost Hunt</i> is a supernatural themed shooting game. Your task is to capture all of the ghosts haunting a castle within a certain time limit.<br><br>There are five different colours of ghosts, and three of each colour. Every ghost has its own distinct movement pattern which can include sudden appearances and disappearances. The player maneuvers a cross-hair around the screen and if they press the button on the ghost while it is visible, it becomes stuck to the cursor. Once a ghost is captured, it must be moved to the side screen out of harm's way, before the next ghost appears.<br><br>In the first part of the game, each ghost appears in order. Capturing all 15 ghosts results in a cut-scene showing the ghosts dancing. The game then continues with the ghosts appearing in random order, and you must try to increase your score by catching as many of them as possible before your time runs out.\n",
