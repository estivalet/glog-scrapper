  "description": "TV-spin-off derived from the title sequence of the Central ITV series 'Magic Micro Mission' broadcast in six UK regions in 1983 and 1984.<br><br>The first part is a simple cockpit-based shooter, with flying saucers zooming past on elliptical paths from bottom left to bottom right or vice versa. You aim to position cross-hair sights with the joystick to shoot these down as they go by.<br><br>The second stage is a maze game similar to Pacman but set on a colourful circuit-board grid, with three 'chip' sprites moving freely around the maze and resistors moving up and down in four columns of the grid. You control a robot which must wipe up patches of 'oil' regularly distributed across the screen while avoiding the other moving components.\n",
