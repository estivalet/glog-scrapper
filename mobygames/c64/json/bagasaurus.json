  "description": "<i>Bagasaurus</i> is a game in which children control a dinosaur. The player has to move the Bagasaurus to the correct answer to questions/tasks which are presented at the bottom of the screen. One example is to pick up an animal which has a tail, picking up a dog would be a correct answer. In response to a correct answer the Bagasaurus will do a little jig. In addition to this there is also a story telling mode.",
