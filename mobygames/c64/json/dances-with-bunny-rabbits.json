  "description": "Life as an adolescent for Texas Timmy isn't too great at the moment. Reluctantly moulded into a cowboy by his Father, the last straw came when his Father confiscated his Teddy-Bear. The only solution to get the bear back is to make his Father proud and the only way Timmy can think of is to find out if a town rumour is true. It is said that in a mine in the Badlands, there are untold riches, so starting in his bedroom Timmy is off to find the riches. <i>Dances With Bunny Rabbits</i> is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
