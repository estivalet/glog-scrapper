  "description": "<i>Fighter Command</i> is a strategy game depicting the clash between the British RAF and German Luftwaffe during the 1940 Battle of Britain. The player is put in command of either air force: Germans need to strike British airbases, radar stations, and industrial centers in order to cripple their aircraft assets, while the Allies will try to defend themselves by wiping out the incoming Germans from the sky before they can reach the intended targets.<br><br>Each day the player gets weather, intelligence, and readiness reports as well as detailed charts listing squadron strength, losses, morale, and experience levels. A map of southern England is also available and allows for easier allocation of planes and targets.<br><br>The player may only play either the Adlertag (August 13, 1940), 10-day phases, or the entire 34-turn campaign (August 13 - September 15, 1940).",
