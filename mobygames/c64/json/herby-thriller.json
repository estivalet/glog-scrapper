  "description": "<i>Herby: Thriller</i> is the second <i>Herby</i> game following the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Herby\">Herby</a> released in the same year. The titular character needs to be guided through ten single-screen rooms. While the game borrows some elements from the original title, the concept is different. Instead of quickly moving between many rooms in a maze usually requiring a single action to progress, each screen is now a single level and a busy environment with traps, enemies, barriers and items.<br><br>A level is won when the exit is reached, but this usually requires a lot of actions such as moving past barriers, avoiding enemies, collecting keys and picking up items to watch their effects as a small amount of puzzles need to be solved. Herby stars with three lives and a single collision is immediately fatal. Other elements on the screen are the current score, the high score and the remaining of lives. Herby can be steered freely in eight directions using a joystick.",
