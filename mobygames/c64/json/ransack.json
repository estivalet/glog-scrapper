  "description": "<i>Ransack</i> is a side-view horizontally-scrolling shooter where the screens scrolls constantly left to right as you control AL, a globular droid on a revenge mission. The eight planets of the Ryvian System haven't been paying its share towards the Democratic Council of Planets and so 'Ransack' clause has been invoked. After a council representative was eaten after being sent to negotiate with the planets, a battle fleet has been planned to be sent. Due to budget cuts though, a robot with a faulty stabiliser system has been sent to bounce along all eight planets to destroy the residents.<br><br>As you bounce you must shoot or avoid the enemy ships while avoiding various obstacles like spikes, and if you are hit then you lose part of your energy which totals fifteen when full. If your energy reaches zero then you lose one of four lives. Power-ups can be collected to help you and these include double fire and bombs. After a planet has been completed a bonus level can be played where you have to keep bouncing on a moving platform blasting alien ships. If you touch the ground then it is off to the next planet.",
