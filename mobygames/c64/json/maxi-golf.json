  "description": "<i>Maxi Golf</i> is a simple 1-4 player golf game.<br><br>Utilizing a birds-eye view of the golf course, the player chooses their club and the direction of their shot. The player chooses shot direction by positioning the golfer's feet around the ball. The player also choose from 5 different strengths of shot (light, fair, medium, firm, and strong), and how much curve they wish to apply.  Wind and terrain play a role in game play, and players must avoid sand and water traps.<br><br>When the player lands a ball on the green, game play shifts to a zoomed in birds-eye view of the green.  The player must then carefully play their putting to place the ball within the hole.  Score is maintained through all 18 holes.<br><br>The game also comes with a scenario editor, which allows the player to make and store custom holes to distribute to other players.  ",
