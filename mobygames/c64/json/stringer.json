  "description": "In <i>Mr. Angry</i>, you play a photographer who photographs women for his own enjoyment. The object of the game is to search behind doors for four items: a pass, a key, a camera, and a lightbulb for the camera. Once you acquire these, open the door at the farthest left and photograph a woman who tries to look pretty by crossing her legs every five seconds.<br><br>But there's a catch: stopping you from completing your tasks is the hotel inspector, manager, and one of the bar patrons. Furthermore, if you open enough doors to find the items you need, chances are you wake Mr. Angry up, and he'll stop at nothing to make your job harder. More often than not, an item of yours will be behind his door.<br><br>There are 10 screens (or floors) to complete. After 10 screens, the difficulty level gets higher, and new characters start to appear like the chef and the security guard, which makes <i>Mr. Angry</i> even more fun. You also have a deadline in which you have to get everything by. If you fail to meet that deadline, you lose a life. As usual, lose all your lives and the game is over.<br><br>Certain doors are hard to get to unless you use elevators. Your enemies are smart enough to know how to use them, and they can catch you even when you are on these elevators. However, the only thing that they can't use is the conveyor belts on Screens 9 and 10.",
