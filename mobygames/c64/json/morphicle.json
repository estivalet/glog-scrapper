  "description": "You have been tasked to save the world in your transforming car '<i>Morphicle</i>' to stop the world from being blown up by a bomb. Over various levels you must drive and fly in search of the bomb to defuse it. Each level is split into three parts and these consist of:<br><br>Part One: You must drive along a road in search of the entrance of an underground compound viewed from above, avoiding touching the sides of the road or it is game over. Some roads have dead ends so a press of the fire button transforms the car into a plane to fly over the obstacles which you can only do a limited number of times. This also has a limited time and you will transform back into the car so you need to make sure you are above a road. The higher the level the less amount of times you can transform.<br><br>Part Two: You are now a glider viewed from the side in a maze which is controlled by various icons. You select an icon to move while another icon shows you where you will move to. Touching the sides of the maze will mean it is game over.<br><br>Part Three: The last part of the level is a sliding puzzle game where you have a picture of the bomb scrambled into various squares and you must move them within a time limit to make the picture of the bomb. When the picture is complete you have defused the bomb and you receive a password for the next level.",
