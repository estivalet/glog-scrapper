  "description": "Like most of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=German+Design+Group\">GDG</a>'s games, <i>Spoils of War</i> is a strategic/managerial wargame. <br><br>You command your conquistadors in exploration, colonization and battle on land and sea. Although the setting strongly reminds of the Spanish occupation of America in 15th and 16th century, the game is settled on a fictive planet called Paradise, in the Orion Sector. <br><br>Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/heirs-to-the-throne\">Heirs to the Throne</a>, gameplay is divided into different phases and activities. You explore and conquer new lands, build cities and havens and try to hold your lands against your opponents, or, even better, try to conquer their territories.<br><br>Battles are very tactical and strategical, as troop experience as well as supplies have a strong impact on battles, too.<br><br>For up to 4 players, the game offers scalable difficulty levels, strong computer AI, an economical as well as different land- and sea-battle systems and even a savable Hall of Fame for the best conquistadors.",
