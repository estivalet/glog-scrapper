  "description": "Graeme Souness Soccer Manager is a basic football managing game based on the English leagues where the player is responsible for bringing a team (any available) from the Conference to the top division.<br><br>Options are limited: the player can select the starting eleven, the players being rated in both ability and fitness, explore the transfer market for signing better players and request overdraft extensions. While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.",
