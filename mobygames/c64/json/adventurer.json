  "description": "Players control their character around a maze of passages, and the object is to find the way out. Along the way, snakes block the way and they must be killed with the players' throwing knife. When they leave whatever screen they killed the snake on and then re-enter the screen, the snakes are resurrected and the player has to kill them again. Points are awarded for killing a snake. The game ends when the player gets eaten.\n",
