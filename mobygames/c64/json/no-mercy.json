  "description": "<i>No Mercy</i> is a military themed crosshair shooting game, very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a>. Players shoot their way through levels by moving the crosshair across the screen and firing. Pressing space shoots rockets.<br><br>There are seven levels in total, starting in a desert camp, then by the river side, jungle plains, an airport, a prison yard, train yards and finally the escape helicopter. The levels are left-to-right scrolling screens, except the third and final level that are stationary. Enemies include foot soldiers, soldiers with bazookas, helicopters, tanks, boats, gunships and jet skis.<br><br>Players have limited health and ammo, and a maximum of three rockets. Bonus items scattered thoughout the levels can be shot to replenish ammo, rockets or health.<br><br>Most likely the game was not available separately and only through the <i>Golden Disk 64</i> magazine.",
