  "description": "This is a two player strategy game. Each player takes turns and, using a joystick, must shift a colored stone. The object is to get four stones of your color in a row, horizontally or vertically. In the Commodore 64 version, this will win you the game. In the Atari 2600 version, this will damage your opponent. If your opponent loses all energy, you win. You can move any stone, no matter what it's color. This means you could damage yourself or lose yourself the game. Once a stone has been moved, that move cannot be reversed.",
