  "description": "This is a collection of three mini-games loosely adapting the May, 1983 Choose Your Own Adventure gamebook number 8 of the same name.  In that book, the reader plays a secret agent underground in the nation of Dorado, a fractured rump state of the former US southwest in the year 2035.  The book concerns itself with escaping from this totalitarian state and returning to democratic Turtalia; the game covers similar territory with less hyperfiction and more primitive driving and flight simulators, following traversal of a 3D maze representing town streets accessed after a jailbreak.  With the player are three fellow travelers: Matt, resistance leader Zoey, and codebreaker Fred -- one of whom is a traitor.",
