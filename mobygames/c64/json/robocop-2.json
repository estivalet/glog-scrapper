  "description": "<i>RoboCop 2</i> is a mission-based platform game. Missions have various objectives, such as destroying Nuke drug canisters or killing all the enemies. If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/robocop\">RoboCop</a>, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.",
