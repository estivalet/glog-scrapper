  "description": "The world is a dangerous place to be after a great Holocaust, and the battle for survival is between humans, androids and mutants. Frontier style towns are battlegrounds between gangs, and innocent people are suffering. You are Zak and you have a reputation as a gunfighter with your lazer shooter and your skills are needed to be put to good use. Aggan and his gang are terrorising your town and have taken your wife hostage so you must collect energy discs and shoot members of Aggan's gang over various levels.<br><br>Each level is the same single screen shooter shown from an elevated angle as you control Zak. You must run around the screen collecting energy discs and once eight have been collected then it's onto the next level. As you collect the discs you can shoot androids that move about the screen but if you touch one or any of the scenery then you lose one of three lives. A joystick or keyboard is used to control your hero.",
