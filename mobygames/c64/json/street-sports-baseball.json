  "description": "A baseball game for 1 or 2 players in which the action takes place in parks, vacant lots and backyards with makeshift bases, rather than on an actual diamond.  In addition to the normal rules of baseball, players must cope with mud puddles, tree stumps, and other hazards.  Features a split-screen view which provides an overview of the entire field alongside close-ups of where the action is happening.\n",
