You can practice each event separately or play the whole competition.<br><br>The game also features a multiple player option, this makes it a nice party game. If you are alone, you can compete against the computer.<br><br>If you're stuck in an event, or want to get better, just take the coaching book (= the manual) and read how you can make more tricks. It also features many real facts of the history of the Olympic summer games.",
