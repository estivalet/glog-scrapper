  "description": "A friendly teddy bear is on hand to help teach the skills children should have on starting school. They are controlled using the space and return keys, so young children should be able to play with little support. Most games have multiple difficulty levels, which reveal themselves after the easiest has been solved.<br><br>If Teddy's friend is to climb the tree successfully, you must recognise which of the items in front of you can be paired up. Initially there are 6, rising to 18 as you get them right. The Gallery game involves matching pictures with the correct label, with more and more options as the game difficulty increases. In the actions game you must choose an action word and watch Teddy act it out.<br><br>To help teddy get up the steps to his beloved honey, you must correctly count the numbers of everyday objects such as teddies, trees and clouds on a screen. The Letters game takes place at the fair - matching the letters displayed will earn your Teddy an ice cream. Parents may wish to offer the same reward to their children, but should watch out for E numbers. The colouring module is less a game and more an experiment in design - choose the colours of each item to form a picture.",
