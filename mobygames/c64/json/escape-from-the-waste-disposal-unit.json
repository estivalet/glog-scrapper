  "description": "Your mission was to go to a Galaxy to befriend an unfriendly race of aliens, but when you arrive in your spacecraft you are hurtled into a large waste disposal unit. Your new mission is to now go through various levels of garbage to escape the unit. The game is viewed on a single screen and you must emit a beam behind your craft and touch the garbage with it that are moving on the screen to get enough energy to move to the next level shown on a bar. You also have another energy bar and this decreases when you use your beam or you touch a piece of garbage and when it empties then it is game over. A Bin-Bug also trapped helps you by allowing you to touch it to increase your energy. Before the game starts you can make the garbage longer horizontally or vertically, or choose a level (1-5).",
