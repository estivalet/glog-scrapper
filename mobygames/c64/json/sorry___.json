  "description": "<i>Sorry!</i> is a licensed computer implementation of the Parker Brothers board game.<br><br>Four players take turns drawing cards from a stack, in an attempt to be the first player to move their four pieces from the starting location around the board, and back to the home location.  Initially, a player must draw a 1 or a 2 to move their piece out of the starting location.  Sliding pieces allow the player to move an extra distance, and if two pieces land on the same location, the original occupying piece is sent back to their home to restart their journey.  The player can set any number of the 4 players to be controlled by the computer.  Other unique cards include the seven, whose moves can be divided between multiple players, and the four, which allows the player to move backwards.  There is also the &quot;Sorry&quot; card, which allows the player to switch position with an opponent piece.",
