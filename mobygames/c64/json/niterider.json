  "description": "<i>Niterider</i> is a top view driving game where the screen scrolls vertically upwards constantly as you move your Trans-Am around the screen avoiding obstacles and other vehicles in the desert. You are being harassed by Hells Angels and these move from the top or the bottom of the screen as well as cars that move down the screen. Cactus and water need avoiding and if you touch any obstacle or vehicle then you lose one of five lives. You are armed with oil-slicks and these can be used to destroy the bikes and if you destroy six bikes then you move up a level but you lose 50 points for every one used.",
