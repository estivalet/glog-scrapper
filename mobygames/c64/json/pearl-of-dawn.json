  "description": "This is an arcade adventure similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=dizzy+series\">Dizzy series</a> and set in medieval fantasy world. The goal of the game is to find the pearl of dawn and to do so you'll have to explore many screens, including the castle and it's surroundings. The basic gameplay is a typical action game without platform jumping elements, however besides slaughtering or avoiding all types of enemies you also need to solve &quot;puzzles&quot; - pick up objects lying on the ground and then find where to use them to proceed further. Pearl of Dawn features many interconnected screens that can be freely traversed back and forth. The game features 2.5D-like-graphics - think <a id=\"de3229633b36bb6f20a1421002528ab6c\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=golden+axe\">Golden Axe</a>, but characters can only move in two planes.
