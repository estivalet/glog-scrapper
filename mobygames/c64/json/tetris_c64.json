  "description": "The C64 version of <i>Tetris</i> is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.<br><br>Compared to other versions, the C64 adaptation differs in a few aspects: the well is 21 blocks high instead of the standard 20. Unlike in other early versions, clearing rows increases the score and a preview of the next piece to appear is always in view and cannot be toggled off for bonus points.<br><br>Options are simple: the starting level can be set from 0 to 9, and there is a choice between music (a continuous piece of 26 minutes in length) or sound effects during gameplay. There is a high score table with room for 15 names.",
