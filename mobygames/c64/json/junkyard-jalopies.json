  "description": "<i>Junkyard Jalopies</i> is a flick-screen platformer where you have to move around two screens per level to collect car parts to finish a car on the bottom left of the first screen. Before you collect car parts you first have to get to the junkyard from the left to the right of the screen, jumping over tyres. Each screen is made up of five levels (with an extra one at the bottom of the screen), and you have to use lifts to go up and down the levels while avoiding creatures and moving objects. If you hit a tyre, creature or object, fall down a level, or allow the timer to reach zero then you lose one of six lives. <br><br>Spread over each level are car parts to build the car and there are also bombs that can be collected. To complete a level you have two choices, build the car before the timer reaches zero or collect the bombs to reset the timer before building the car. Your hero is constantly moving and when you collect a car part you take it to the unfinished car to place it in the correct place to receive money. Once the car is built then you drive away before seeing an animated scene of you selling it for money. You then move to the next level with more creatures and objects with more bombs and car parts on the screen.",
