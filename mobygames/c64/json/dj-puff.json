  "description": "The player is DJ Puff the fire breathing dragon, set out to fry all your enemies in one puff. The objective of the game is to collect certain 'discs' spread across the game. These discs are either placed in hard to reach places or appear after you defeat certain types of monsters. <br><br>Basically you have to blast your way through or fly (jump) through treacherous terrain: water and bamboo sticks are one of many terrain types that can kill your character. Blasted monsters turn into 'bonus fruit' (yes, fruit) of which you can obtain for additional points.<br><br>A unique attribute of DJ Puff is that you can modify the speed to a very wide range, therefore the current CPU speed can be modified to suit the player (from Zzzzz speed to Lightning speed).",
