  "description": "In the dangerous and evil Deeps of <i>Doriath</i> lies the Coronet of Arien which will give the owner immortality when held. It was cast into the depths by Atelan, Lord of Time after himself and the Coronet were rejected by the woman he loved, Fianna. Centuries later and you, Elidaan the Loremaster have found a scroll with ancient writings written by Fianna describing the Coronet and it's powers. In this side view flick-screen arcade adventure you must explore the depths of <i>Doriath</i> in search of the prize.<br><br>As you explore you must gain 100% wisdom and find eight pieces of the Riddlescroll of Wurslea to tell you the exact location and how to retrieve the Coronet. To increase your wisdom you must open chests found scattered around which will contain pieces of the scroll and other useful objects. There are also various creatures roaming around and these either need destroying with spells or avoiding as this reduces your stamina when you touch them, and when it reaches below 2% it is game over. There are various spells that can be used but these need amulets to use them to destroy your enemies.<br><br>Potions can also be found to help or hinder yourself and these include Stamina, Fungata and Cloronar. There are obstacles that can reduce stamina and objects that require the correct coloured keys to pass. The joystick and keyboard is combined to play the game.<br><br><br><br>",
