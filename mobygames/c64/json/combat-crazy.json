  "description": "On a long and dangerous mission to kill the leader of an enemy army called Warbringer, you are the last remaining soldier but you have vowed to fight on until the mission is complete or you die. You must battle your way through three large areas, tropical rainforest, underground labyrinth and Warbringer's fortress before your final confrontation with him. <i>Combat Crazy</i> is a shooter with platform elements where the screen scrolls in various directions when you move your hero, and you must shoot various soldiers as well as weapons and avoid fatal obstacles. To complete an area you must find the exit to the next one within 16 minutes, but to progress you have to find two parts of a H-Bomb to blow the exit, which are scattered over the area. <br><br>Enemy soldiers run around the area and you can shoot them with your rifle or throw grenades which are limited but more can be picked up along the way as well as various bonuses to increase your firepower or get a shield which lasts for a limited time. Pressing the spacebar at any time kills yourself and all on screen but you lose a life. There are also various large weapons firing at you and these can be shot or avoided as well and if you are hit by any weapon or bullets then you lose part of an energy bar and when it empties then you lose one of five lives. Various obstacles are in each area and these include spikes, water and lava and if these are touched then you instantly lose a life. When you lose all five lives it is game over but you have three credits to allow you to continue where you last died. ",
