  "description": "It is the year 2123. The genetically-programmed warriors of the Andromedan Hegemony are making the first moves to enforce their government's greatest desire: the takeover of the United Planets of Solaria's fantastically wealthy new mines in the Asteroid Belt. On Earth, capitol of the United Planets, military and political leaders are beginning frantic efforts to marshal human and material resources to fight off the alien onslaught.<br><br>There is a knock at the front entrance to your dwelling. You open the door, only half-surprised to see that your visitor is a courier robot, painted in the distinctive blue-and-white uniform colors of the Solarian Armed Forces. It registers your palm-print on its signature pad, then passes you a sealed file container. You know without opening the file that it contains a draft notice and briefing materials. In a few hours you will be in the cockpit of a Katana single-seat interceptor, perhaps fighting for your life against the invading Andromedans....<br><br>So the stage is set for <b><i>Deep Space -- Operation Copernicus</b></i>. As the pilot of a Katana war vessel, you will have your choice of four missions to test your skill and tactics flying--and fighting--amid the hurtling debris of the asteroid cluster known as the Trojan Group. Survival is up to you!",
