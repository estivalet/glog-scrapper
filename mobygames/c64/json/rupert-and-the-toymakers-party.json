  "description": "The first digital outing of Rupert Bear, a classic British cartoon character that has been appearing in newspaper Daily Express since 1920.<br><br>Rupert has made himself late for his chums' party. The route to the party is through the evil Toymaker's castle.\nIn this platform game, each level is three screens long and consists of three floors connected by stairways that Rupert has to leap up or down. Collect all party invitations but watch out for marching toy soldiers, birds, planes and Jack-out-of-the-boxes. Touch any of them and Rupert loses one of his initial four lives.\nLuckily white-coloured baddies are willing to cooperate. Jump on them and they will transport Rupert to platforms that initially seem unreachable.<br><br>Once all party invitations are collected, a door to the next level will open. In all seven platform levels in the castle must be negotiated before Rupert can attend the party.",
