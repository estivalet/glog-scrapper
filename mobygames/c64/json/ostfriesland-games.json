  "description": "An obvious send-up of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=California+Games\">California Games</a>, this is another humorous collection of competitive sporting events with a certain &quot;local&quot; character - this time set in Ostfriesland, Germany, where the collective taste in sports is apparently rather quaint.  Popular regional games include cow milking (in which other cow <i>products</i> may be tossed into your opponent's bucket), shooting pigs (out of the sky), bike riding (with square wheels), teabag throwing, and (for that adrenaline-pumping extreme sports kick) competitive roof-building.<br><br>The above events blend playing against the clock, against the computer, and against another human player; you may practice each one individually or, if particularly lacking in self-respect, play the full set in a row.  As with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/blood-n-guts\">Blood 'n Guts</a>, be ready for a lot of joystick waggling.",
