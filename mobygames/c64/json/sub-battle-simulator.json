  "description": "<i>Sub Battle Simulator</i> is set in World War 2, with the player on the American or German side. Six different submarines are simulated in a total of 60 missions. You will have to navigate, using five different levels of mapping, and plan attacks based on weather and surroundings, paying close attention to the radar. Watch out for torpedoes and Sonars.<br><br>This was the first submarine simulation to include aircraft as opponents. You can choose to remain on the surface and defend yourself with your guns, or dive and hope to avoid the bomb and/or strafing that'll surely follow.<br><br>",
