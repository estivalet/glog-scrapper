  "description": "In <em>City Fighter</em>, a simple crosshair-shoot-em-up, you have to protect the city of London against an alien invasion. The alien attackers are on their way to destroy your underground nuclear reactor. To avoid this, you have to steer a powerful cannon from right to left, trying to blast away waves of attackers. The attackers will drop bombs on you. In each wave an alien starship mounted with an aggressive missile waits for you. Avoid the bombs and missiles and don't let the attackers reach the ground of the city. Once they reach the ground they will destroy your underground reactor: Your game will be over - the city of London will be history...",
