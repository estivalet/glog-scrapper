  "description": "You pilot the Z-Fighter. By cybernetic control, your brain becomes one with the ship and your every thought becomes motion. Destroy all attacking aliens. Fail, and the known universe will be overrun by the bloodthirsty aliens. A true shoot-em-up. The joystick controls all motion. Fire button fires.<br><br>Destroy alien encounters and score points. The higher the level, the greater the challenge. The greater the challenge, the larger the points received.\nAfter destroying 10 aliens, an energy unit will appear. If you destroy this, you will free an energy capsule. Chase and collect the capsule to obtain energy bombs.<br><br>Once you have gathered several energy bombs, you can blast a hole through the moving force barrier surrounding the Transporter Unit. Create a large enough hole and you will be able to warp through hyperspace to the next level. Complete all 4 levels and the universe is saved and you are a hero.",
