  "description": "Players control a tank which must collect the radiation packs scattered through various locations including forest, rocket pad, airport, bridge, and refinery. Players must also deal with enemies running around each location either by firing at them or memorizing their patterns so that they can be avoided. Ammunition is limited, but more can be gained by getting radiation packs. If the player collides with an enemy or touches a wall, a life will be lost. If the game is completed, the player goes back to the forest and starts with a score of zero.",
