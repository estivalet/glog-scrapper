  "description": "This is a horizontal-scrolling shooter that consist of only three stages. The aim is to guide your ship, shooting any airborne enemies that come your way. You have a single pistol that you can use to destroy them, but by shooting an entire group your weapon can be upgraded to twin shots. Shooting enemies drain the weapon's energy; and when there is no energy left, you have to wait for a number of seconds before you can shoot again. Contact with enemies results in a loss of life and whatever weapon you are using will be lost. The game ends when you lose all your ships.<br><br>",
