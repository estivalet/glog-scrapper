  "description": "Topper is a Copper in the shape of a top hat with arms and legs. There has been a crime and it's up to Topper to find the clues to apprehend the criminal from seven suspects and send him to jail within a time limit. The area is a collection of rooms on four levels connected by corridors and a lift system. The rooms are platforms games with a number of safes which may or not contain a clue about the crime. Collect them all until you have eight clues. One of the safes also contains a key to the jail. In the rooms are baddies and obstacles which need avoiding as a touch decreases part of your energy bar but can be replenished by visiting the police station. Lose your energy and it's game over.<br><br>The lift system consists of baskets moving up and down all the way down to the bottom level and up to the top level. Miss jumping into a basket and you fall into the boiler at the bottom and it's game over. Once you have collected the eight clues you can go to the courthouse where you are given a random riddle and using your clues you must answer it, get it right and you can take the criminal to jail. <br><br>The platform rooms are shown on one screen and the corridor sections are flick screen and viewed from the side. A joystick is used to control Topper.",
