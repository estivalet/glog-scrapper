  "description": "<i>Adventure Master</i> is one in a series of adventure creation programs that were popular in the mid-80s and allows you to create text-adventures with some graphics.<br><br>The system uses a simple two-word parser, so you are limited to commands like &quot;Go North&quot; or &quot;Get Thingamajig&quot;. The creation process is not overly complex: You can create rooms, objects and descriptions and add graphical illustrations and words to the parser. Graphics are limited to 160x96 4-color mode; there is also a limit of about ten pictures per created game  <br><br>It also included one complete and two unfinished sample adventures:\n<ul><li><i>Becca in Outlaw Cave</i></li>\n<li><i>Clever Catacombs</i> (finished)</li>\n<li><i>Wild Trails</i></li></ul>",
