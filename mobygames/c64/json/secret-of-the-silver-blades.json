  "description": "The heroes from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pool-of-radiance\">Pool of Radiance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/curse-of-the-azure-bonds\">Curse of the Azure Bonds</a> return once again.  This time, they arrive naked via a magical well inside a frozen town wishing for heroes to help them.  The party once again attempts to save a town under siege (once re-equipped) and struggles to learn the secret of the Silver Blades...<br><br>The gameplay is quite similar to that of the previous <i>Gold Box</i> games. Following the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=AD%26D\"> AD&D</a> rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. Unlike the previous games, there is no &quot;world map&quot; traveling in <i>Secret of the Silver Blades</i>. All the exploration takes place in the 3D world.",
