  "description": "<i>Logger</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Frogger\">Frogger</a> variant that as the title makes clear swaps the frog hero for a logger. Aside from the theme, it works like any version of the arcade game with the player starting out at the bottom of the screen and having to first move across a busy logging trail full of vehicles and then a river full of logs and barges. The aim is to reach one of the unoccupied cabins that are located at the top of the screen. A life is lost when hit by a vehicles, jumping into the river or moving outside the screen. Sometimes bears will appear on the grass strip in the middle and these too have to be avoided. Above the playing field is a sun moving from left to right and each level has to be completed before it sets. The player starts with three lives and gets an extra one when all five cabins are occupied.",
