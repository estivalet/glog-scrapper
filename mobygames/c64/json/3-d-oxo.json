  "description": "<i>3 D OXO</i> is based on the classic pen and paper game Noughts and Crosses. Instead of playing on one 3x3 grid though, the game has you trying to make a line of X's on a 4x4 cube. The aim is to beat the computer by placing X's and making a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line on the surface or through the cube. Each side of the cube is shown on the screen and the keyboard is used to place your X's.",
