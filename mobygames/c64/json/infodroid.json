  "description": "<i>Infodroid</i> is set on a planet which exclusively deals with administration and focuses on the delivery of information and packages. The player is in charge of a startup company and tries to become a big player within a established competition.<br><br>All deliveries are executed by droids which travel on five streams (two forward and two backwards) with different speeds; the central being static and allowing to enter a variety of rooms: junctions, dispatch rooms in which new delivery jobs can be taken and old ones concluded, information rooms where the game options can be changed and garages for repair duties. On the way, droids from other companies try to ram the player (hence the need for repairs) which need to be avoided by jumping between the streams. With money earned by delivering packages to the correct destination, new droids can be bought or the old ones upgraded, e.g. better shields or boosts which allow to jump multiple streams at once.",
