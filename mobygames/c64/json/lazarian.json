  "description": "In <i>Lazarian</i>, the player controls a space ship going through missions to rescue other space ships which have become stranded. In doing so the player will have to shoot at flying meteorites, aliens, and flying eyes. The player's space ship can be killed by being hit by meteorites and getting shot by aliens or cannons.<br><br>There are five stages to be completed. The final stage sees the player confronting the Lazarian itself which is defeated when the 'Evil Eye' is destroyed. The player's firepower varies from stage to stage; in the final stage for example it is limited to a small range which means the player must get close to the Lazarian to defeat it. ",
