  "description": "Everything one needs to know about this game one can glean from its title.  This game simulates the stimulation of a phallus by a hand, changing the stroking direction using the joystick or the down and left arrows on the keyboard.  With sufficient speed and rhythm, the phallus will lengthen.  Overstimulation may lead the phallus to change colour, a warning that a premature climax is at the threshold; scaling back the vigorousness of the stimulation allows the player to resume playing for the high score, as measured in total phallic length.  When climax is achieved, or when the timer ticks down, the player's performance is evaluated and scored.",
