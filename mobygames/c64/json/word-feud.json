  "description": "<i>Word Feud</i> is a puzzle game for one or two players. A three- or four-letter word is displayed at the top of the screen, and players need to find the same word among the eight rows of jumbled letters. Three humans are displayed on a line at the bottom of the screen. If the player manages to find the given word, another human is added to the line. If the chosen word does not match the given word, then its location is revealed and a human is destroyed. If players get thirteen humans on the line, the game ends and a new game begins as soon as a key is pressed. There are two variations to the game: one where the given word is hidden to the player, plus another where either a butterfly or frog will eventually eat all the letters if the player does not hurry up and finds the word.",
