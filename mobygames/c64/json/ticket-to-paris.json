  "description": "<i>Ticket to Paris</i> is an educational game designed to teach players about French language and culture.<br><br>The player arrives at Charles de Gaulle airport with several hundred dollars in American currency with the goal of learning about French language and culture.  The player can visit a variety of locations in the city, including the Eiffel Tower, the Louve, and the Pompidou, and more.  During their time in Paris, they must regularly eat and sleep to keep their energy up, if they don't they will collapse and have to spend the day in the hospital.  At every location the player visits, a French woman shows up and quizzes the player.  Time passes while the player stays in a location, and the player can choose to travel by foot, Metro, or taxi to manage their expenses and time. <br><br>As the player explores, they receive tasks, including visiting specific locations and seeing famous monuments.  More mundane tasks are included, such as going to a restaurant, grocery stores, or department store to purchase a specific item in French.  The player can even go to the horse tracks to gamble.  Whenever the player completes a specific task, they are given a clue to the identity of a famous French person.  Once the player gathers sufficient clues to guess their identity, they can return to the airport, and if they correctly guess the individual, they can leave Paris.  ",
