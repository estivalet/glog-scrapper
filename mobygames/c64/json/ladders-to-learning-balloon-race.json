  "description": "<i>Ladders to Learning: Balloon Race</i> is an educational game for ages 10 years upwards and allows one to four players to play a board game about the subject of Air and the Atmosphere. The game is a single screen and shows four paths with 15 dots with hot-air balloons on the starting dot, and the idea is for the balloons to reach the other side of the water with the first balloon to reach the 15th dot the winner. Each player takes it in turns to spin a dial with an arrow, and on the dial are the numbers one to four, and four question marks. If the arrow stops on a number then the player moves that many dots before the next player then spins. Occasionally a strong wind will appear and move the player back. <br><br>If the player stops the arrow on a question mark then they answer a question and if the answer is correct then they move forwards. If the answer is wrong then an explanation of the correct answer appears. To land on the winning dot then the correct number must be spun to land on the dot exactly or the player moves back to where they first spun the arrow. Before the game starts, the players have the chance to read about Air and Atmosphere to give them a better chance to answer the questions correctly.",
