  "description": "The president has been kidnapped and it is currently being held behind enemy lines. Players take control of a soldier who has to cross through the enemy lines to rescue this very important prisoner of war.  <br><br>The game consist of five different timed maps which make up the battlefield. Gameplay itself is viewed from a top down perspective of the war torn battlefield, which is filled with trenches and other obstacles, not to mention the enemy guards. Scattered among the battlefield are items which the player can collect to add to their inventory. Items include TNT, fuses, ladders, mines, keys, and wire cutters. These items will be needed to overcome obstacles to get through the battlefield and rescue the prisoner. The soldier is also equipped with a gun that can fire bullets at any incoming enemy soldiers.<br><br>The Famicom version of the game features a Game A, Game B and 2 Play mode. Game A is the basic game, while Game B increases the difficulty by constantly firing missiles at the player. The 2 Play mode has one player controlling the soldier while the other player controls the missiles. The missiles can be used to destroy enemy soldiers, however they can still harm the other player.",
