  "description": "GameTek's home version of the classic game show <i>The Price is Right</i>. Bob Barker and the Beauties are not present, but a multitude of pricing games from the show, as well as the wheel and the showcase, have been faithfully replicated. <br><br>Four (or a maximum of eight, counting both rounds - the programme suggests switching players) contestants can play, with the computer filling in for the rest. Whether bidding on Contestant's Row or playing a pricing game, contestants will attempt to closely guess the price of an item provided. All items in the game are often-unintentionally-humorous misspellings of recognizable brand names, to avoid trademark infringement.<br><br>Pricing games include the Mountain Climbing (in which your 3 guesses must be less than $300 away in total, otherwise a goat will push you over the edge), Safe Cracking (in which you have 3 possibilities for each part of the price, and must correctly guess it) and the Dice Game (in which you accept or reject random rolls to get the real price).<br><br>There is a persistent Hall of Fame with winners and their scores, and a parser for guessing/bidding prices. Players have to type in their price guesses, and answer to the math of how &quot;off&quot; they were, as they would if they were on the show.",
