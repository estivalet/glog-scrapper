Taking control of one or the other (Puffy is more powerful but Puffyn can move faster) you must find your way through.<br><br><i>Puffy's Saga</i> is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.<br><br>Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.",
