  "description": "<i>Julius Cäsar</i> is a strategy game in which the player takes the role of Julius Caesar in ancient Rome. The goal is to pacify all 30 Gallic tribes by negotiating peace agreements with them. This can either be done with diplomatic means, i.e. giving them money, or with force. The player has four legions which can be used for warfare and a menu gives statistics about each tribe for planning. However, the player has to act within a budget which only can be increased by tribute payments from pacified tribes. After each year the player has to give account to the senate which approve another year of leadership. They also give reinforcements for lost men in the legions, but the amount depends on their successes. The gameplay is menu based except when choosing a target for warfare: then the player directly moves a character over the map.",
