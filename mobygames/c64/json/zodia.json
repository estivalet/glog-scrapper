  "description": "Exploring other Galaxies hasn't gone well for you and your fellow intergalactic explorers as you are now the only survivor. To make matters worse on the way home, you have strayed into a Galaxy run by warlords from the planet Zordia and they don't like visitors. In this top view vertical shooter with the screen scrolling constantly upwards, you have to destroy or avoid wave after wave of alien ships to hopefully reach your own Galaxy. If you hit any alien ship then you lose one of three lives and when they are gone it is game over. Before you start you have two choices of difficulty (Difficult or Impossible) and a joystick is used to control your ship.",
