If this is done successfully, a code will be granted - put them all together at the end of the game. Foes are released in swarms through a control box. Once all these are dead you must destroy the box, to prevent respawning.<br><br>The dungeons feature treasure, food (for energy), and spells. Be careful not to destroy these by shooting them. Each spell has a random function - disorientating, paralysing or killing the opponents on screen. Like Gauntlet you are constantly losing energy, however treasure can be traded in for energy.",
