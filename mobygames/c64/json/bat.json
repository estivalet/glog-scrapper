  "description": "<i>B.A.T.</i> is a cyberpunk romp through the underworld of crime and corruption. As agent for B.A.T. (Bureau of Astral Troubleshooters), an ultra-secret organization serving the Confederation of the Galaxies in the 22nd century, you will be assigned various missions covering a wide range of spy activities and planets. <br><br><i>B.A.T.</i> is a mixture of first-person adventure game and role-playing. Most of the game is spent exploring the futuristic locations, talking to characters and gathering items needed to advance the narrative. Combat occurs randomly and utilizes a real-time system: the player must prepare for the battle within a limited amount of time, after which the combatants exchange blows. The protagonist is able to side-step and dodge the attacks. Other features include the ability to program the B.O.B. (organic computer implanted on your arm), and RPG-style character development based on various stats.",
