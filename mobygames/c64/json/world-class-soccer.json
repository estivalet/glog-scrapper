  "description": "<i>World Class Soccer</i> is a soccer (football) game that ties in with the 1990 football World Cup. The game uses a top-down perspective for matches and features the full World Cup structure and all the 24 teams who were involved. Multiple formations and team selections are available before each match. The ball sticks to the feet of the players, who can be tackled either by doing a block tackle, or attempting a slide tackle, which risks giving away a foul. Matches can vary between 4 and 90 minutes, and each player has differing skills and behaviour style depending on his team's relative ability.",
