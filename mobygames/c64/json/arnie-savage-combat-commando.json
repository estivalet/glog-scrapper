  "description": "<i>Arnie 2</i> is an isometric action game. Although it's obvious to which Hollywood actor the game's name alludes, <i>Arnie 2</i> is not a licensed title and not based on any movie.<br><br>It is the sequel to the Amiga / C64 platform game <a id=\"d34bbe4996245ab2f75bee00d5e37ea49\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Arnie\">Arnie</a> (1992). Unlike the previous title it has been developed in-house by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Zeppelin\">Zeppelin</a><br><br>Fast reflexes and a lust for violence are required for success here. Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.<br><br>Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.",
