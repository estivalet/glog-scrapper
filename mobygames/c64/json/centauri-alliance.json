  "description": "Describing <i>Centauri Alliance</i> as &quot;<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/tales-of-the-unknown-volume-i-the-bards-tale\">The Bard’s Tale</a> in Space&quot; would be fitting since it was designed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,11314/\">Michael Cranford</a>, the creator of the first two Bard's Tale games. In this science-fiction RPG, players build a party by designing characters from six different races and arming them with a variety of weapons and psychic powers. They then set off across a cluster of star systems on a secret mission to find a powerful super-weapon and save the worlds of the Alliance from evil forces.<br><br>The game contains most of the standard RPG elements of late '80s games including first person 10' X 10' square adventuring maps, turn-based combat and an ongoing quest to find bigger and better ways to kill things.",
