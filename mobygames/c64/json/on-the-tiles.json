  "description": "In the low light areas of a city, a stray cat is out to prove that it is the meanest cat in the neighborhood. To do this, it must prowl the streets looking for fish bones. When it has eaten enough of these, it is able to move on to the next territory.<br><br>While searching for them, it must also be on the lookout for hawks, hedgehogs, and frogs. These must be avoided by either jumping over them or spitting at them. The cat's energy is drained if it comes into contact with any of these, but eating sparrows and mice will replenish some of its energy. Another problem is fleas, which get into its coat. If more than ten fleas are in its coat, then one of the cat's lives are lost. Finally, other cats are patrolling the streets looking for the same things, so there is likely to be a cat fight or two.<br><br>People living on the street don't appreciate cats walking around the backyard. These people throw buckets or boots if it gets close to their front door. One of the neighbors owns a dog who is on the lookout for any cats that approach him. If the cat gets near him, he will be eaten and it will lose a life.<br><br>",
