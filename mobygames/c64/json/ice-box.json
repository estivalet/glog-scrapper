  "description": "<i>Ice Box</i> was developed for the annual <a href=\"http://www.minigamecomp.org.uk/\">Mini Game Competition</a> and was an entry for the 1k size category.<br><br>The gameplay in <i>Ice Box</i> is somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a>. Over the playing field ice cubes appear, moving from left to right and back. By holding the space key, you drop the ice cube into the playing field. Note that the ice cubes dropped onto other ice cubes tend to slide down. If three or more ice cubes with the same appearance are touching, they disappear. The game ends once the ice cubes have reached the top edge of the playing field. ",
