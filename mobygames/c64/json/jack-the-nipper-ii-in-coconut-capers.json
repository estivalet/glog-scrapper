  "description": "Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Australia, with the aim of progressing through 192 screens of platform action. He starts with nine lives but no weapons, although a supply of coconuts to lob is close at hand. <br><br>The jungle is full of snakes, monkeys, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs.<br><br>As well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).
