  "description": "After some shameful deeds, your people hate you and have put you in exile, but respect your skills as a combat pilot. Thus, they have sent you on a suicide mission to wipe out their enemy and keep them from future harassment.<br><br>The game is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from above, but a control system in which the ship rotates at an angle with a press of left or right. Your ship has smart bombs installed, and its basic weapon can be improved by collecting the tokens which shot enemies can release.",
