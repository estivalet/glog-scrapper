  "description": "<i>The Great Burger Riot</i> is a side view horizontal scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls constantly from left to right as you control a hamburger shooting or avoiding burgers and cans of coke over various levels. As you progress you will also encounter fences and other obstacles which need shooting and if you touch any food stuff, obstacle or the sides of the screen then you lose one of four lives. At the end of each level you must shoot all objects on the screen before a certain time to move to the next level.",
