  "description": "In this game, players navigate their spaceship around a single level where eight yellow eggs are stored. These eggs release several creatures, and it is the player's task to crush them with an egg scattered around the level. Once the egg is used, another one reappears on a different platform than the last one. The player proceeds to the next level when all the creatures have been destroyed. Stopping the player from completing their task are airborne enemies which can be killed with the ship's built-in laser.\n",
