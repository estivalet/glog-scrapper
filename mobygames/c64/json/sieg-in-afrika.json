  "description": "<i>Sieg in Afrika</i> is a tactical war simulation based upon the North African campaign between the Axis and Allied forces during World War II. <br><br>Italy declared war on Great Britain and France on June 10, 1940.  Mussolini immediately ordered his troops in Libya to advance into Egypt.  With more that ten divisions in North Africa to the three Allied divisions, he foresaw no difficulties the Western desert forces in detail.<br><br>Designed for 1 - 2 players, each player controls the major land forces of either the Axis or Allied forces. A computer opponent is available for 1-player games. The viewpoint is from a corps level commander, and the player assigns movement and combat tasks for those groups, and responds to operational events.  <br><br>The game is text-only, and came with a board and physical pieces to allow the player to keep track of the location of theirs and enemy units. All games begin in in June 1940, and progresses in 1 month intervals.  Each break allows the player to input new commands for their forces.  Each phase has an intelligence gathering component and a second component where troop orders can be given.  Forces can be instructed to attack, break off, engage &amp; destroy, hold, leaguer, move, rush, or search &amp; sweep a location.  The player must contend with limited fuel, food, and ammunition, and must make tactical decisions as to which units to reinforce.  <br><br>At the end of each turn, the player receives radio reports from their troops and main command regarding current enemy troop locations and combat results.\n",
