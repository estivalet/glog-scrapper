  "description": "You have been given a chance to show off your skills to play for a top football team. You must participate in four skill tests and complete each skill to a satisfactory standard and you can then participate in a assault course which includes all four skills. Before the tests you can choose your kit colour and skill level. The four skill tests are viewed from a 3rd person perspective at an elevated angle and you use the joystick to control your player. The tests are:<br><br>Dribbling: You must dribble a ball around various cones with the direction indicated by an arrow within a time limit of two minutes. A small part of the pitch is shown and the screen scrolls when you move upwards towards the goal. If you miss too many cones then the test is over.<br><br>Tackling: Players will  move diagonally down the screen and you must tackle and get the ball off them within one minute. If you miss a player or foul him then you lose part of a bar and when it reaches zero it is test over. <br><br>Passing: You stand in the middle of a circle of players and you must pass to a flashing player within a couple of seconds. The test lasts for one minute and if you pass to the wrong player or take to long to pass then you lose part of a bar. <br><br>Penalties: You must waggle the joystick to approach the ball with the screen showing a small part of the pitch. As you run up to the ball with the screen scrolling upwards you can see the goal in front of you with a moving cursor going to the left and right of the keeper. When you reach the ball you press fire to kick the ball with the power determined on how fast you approached the ball. You keep taking penalties until one minute is up.",
