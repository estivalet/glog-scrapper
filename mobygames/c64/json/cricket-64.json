  "description": "<i>Cricket 64</i> allows you to interact with a game of cricket between England and the West Indies in a limited overs match. Before you start the match you can change the players names of each team and decide who bats and bowls first, before you then select a bowler. The match itself is shown on the whole screen from above at an elevated angle and your final adjustment if choosen to is to move the fielders. Once you are happy with your selection the game begins. You watch the bowler approach the wicket before bowling the ball and then you watch the batsman either hit the ball, miss the ball, get out for LBW or the wicket being hit. <br><br>If the batsman hits the ball you watch the ball move until it stops. The fielder nearest to the ball is highlighted and you then decide whether to run or not. If you choose to run then the ball is thrown as both batsman run to the opposite end of the wicket. Once they reach the other end without getting out, the balls stops and you decide whether to run again. if you decide not to run then the bowler gets the ball and he approaches the wicket once more. At the end of an over you can decide whether to see the scorecard and you select the next bowler.",
