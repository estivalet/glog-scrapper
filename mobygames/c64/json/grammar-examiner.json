  "description": "<i>The Grammar Examiner</i> is a grammar board game for one to four players.<br><br>Players take on the role of an aspiring newspaper reporter, where they must travel about a board trying to earn money by answering grammar questions.  There is the option for a computer opponent named Melvin, who has modifiable intelligence. Players can role a 1 - 6, and can move about on the board as they see fit.  They can't land on the same type of space twice in a row.  Squares include random transportation about the map, being sent back to the starting area, random chance where the player gains or loses money, a grammar multiple choice question, or having to fix all the grammar errors in a short paragraph.  The player can gain or lose money on every square, and the goal is to reach $23,000 before their opponents do.",
