  "description": "Realistic physics and gravity make an appearance in this scrolling shoot 'em up. G-Man is a space geologist who is sent on a research mission, but misses the moonbus back (maybe he's not so 'super' then). To get back to safety, he'll have to navigate the Sea of Dreams and its nightmarish hordes of alien beings. Contact with rock faces, landmines or those aliens will cost you a life. You are armed with a laser and your Jetpac, which will need recharges of ammunition and fuel - these are dotted along the jagged surface and will require precise positioning to retrieve. There are several teleports along the surface, which will advance you a short way through the level.",
