  "description": "<i>Pasta Wars: Pasta Blasta</i> is a single screen shooter where you are Heinz 'Hurricane' Solo and must protect six ravioli tins from being taken off screen by Pasta Pinchas, by shooting a limited amount of Pasta Powda in a Sauce Squirter. You move around the screen by holding down forward while being able to turn 360 degrees, and if you let go off forward then momentum keeps you moving until you stop. The Pinchas appear of the edge of the screen and move around towards a tin and when they stop above one then they start to move towards the edge of the screen with the tin. As you blast, then your Pasta Powda decreases shown by a gauge but catching a Pasta Powda Pill increases it, but if you shoot the pill then the Pinchas get it. You are also armed with three Pasta Pellet's which stops all Pinchas on the screen but you are able to keep moving. If you touch a Pinchas or a tin then you lose one of seven lives and you appear in the place of a tin. Two players can play with each player taking it in turns to play when the other player loses a life and there are 10 skill levels (0-9) to choose from at the start of the game.",
