  "description": "<i>Gangster</i> is a single screen shooter using a LightGun where you play the role of a Downtown Cop who has been assigned by your boss to prevent a big prison escape over three screens. You have to shoot a certain amount of prisoners on each screen with limited ammo and you cannot let a certain amount escape or you lose one of three lives. Shooting police cars, hostages, or running out of ammo also loses a life. The three screens contains the following:<br><br>Jailbreak: Viewed from a 1st person perspective as you are standing outside the prison with a huge hole in the wall. You must shoot any prisoner that appears and try to stop them running off the screen. <br><br>Escape: Viewed from above, any escaped prisoners are now driving around the roads to get to a rendezvous at Charlie's Bar and you have to shoot the cars while avoiding shooting police cars.<br><br>Rendezvous: Viewed from a 1st person perspective again, you are now outside the bar and you have to shoot any prisoner that appears in the windows while avoiding shooting any hostages that appear.",
