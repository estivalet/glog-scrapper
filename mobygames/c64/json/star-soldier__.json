  "description": "<i>Star Soldier</i> is a run 'n gun game where you play a bounty hunter doing jobs for various planets for credits. You start the game choosing which weapons to use and how many energy packs to take. Once you are equipped you then scan the star system for any planets and when you find a planet you can get the information for it and any jobs they require. On the planet surface the game is viewed from above as you run horizontally from right to left with the screen scrolling when you move shooting soldiers running and shooting at you from all angles as well as any gun turrets. <br><br>If you touch a soldier or a bullet then you lose part of your energy shown in a bar. If you have more than one energy pack then the bar will refill when empty, have no more packs and it's game over. As well as your gun you can press the space bar to fire any extra weapons you have like grenades or missiles which are limited to how many you chose to take. When some soldiers are killed they leave behind objects like credits and weapons. A job is completed when you reach the end of the level. After a congratulatory message you can then choose another job.",
