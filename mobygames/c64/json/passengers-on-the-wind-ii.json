  "description": "<i>Passengers on the Wind II</i> allows players to decide the fate of the heroes and direct all of them so that they reach their aim. Players will discover many locations, directions, and events; and will live different stories according to the directions that he makes the characters take. Everything is controlled using either the keyboard or the joystick.<br><br>Players are both the director and the heroes. The screen is divided into three main elements: a graphical section where the action takes place; a section showing the character players are directing; and the section containing text, from which players decide the action. <br><br>The player can take several actions during the game: saving a game, viewing flashbacks (in slow or fast motion), or intervention on the central graphic screen to make the action develop. <br><br>The game is split into seven episodes which players have to gradually make their way through. In each, a main scene is displayed in the graphical section, and by simple confirmation players can make the characters appear.<br><br>To avoid restarting the game at the beginning each time, players are given an opportunity to save the situation in progress. In this case, a blank, formatted disk is required to save these situations.",
