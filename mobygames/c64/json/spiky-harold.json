  "description": "Winter is nearly here and Spiky Harold the hedgehog has only 24 hours to eat as much as he can before hibernating. You play as Harold and in this one player flick-screen platform game you must explore various screens and eat any food you find. On each screen are various nasties and if you touch them you lose one of 20 lives as you try to beat the clock. Coins can be collected to gain extra lives but any wine glasses picked up and it turns Harold drunk. As well as the main playing area you can see your lives, food eaten and time, and a joystick or keyboard is used to control Harold.",
