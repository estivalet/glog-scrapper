  "description": "<i>Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom</i> is an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Indiana+Jones+Games\">Indiana Jones</a> game that isn't based on a movie. Indy is looking for a lost civilization. He has to solve puzzles and traps left behind to get to the treasure and get out alive.<br><br>The entire game consists of only six screens all of which have monsters and puzzles guarding the exits. Not only will you have to solve the puzzles but first you must figure out what the puzzles are because no clues were left behind. The game's motto is: &quot;Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you.&quot;",
