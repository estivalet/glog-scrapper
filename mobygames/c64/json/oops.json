  "description": "<i>Oops!</i> is an arcade puzzle game where the aim is to move a Quadroid over 32 levels, collecting eight gravity pods on each top view single screen. You have to move your Quadroid over a maze of platforms while avoiding nasties that move about each screen and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. As you move about the screen there are also various platforms to be wary of like platforms that disappear when moved across, platforms that turn on and off, and platforms that send you in a certain direction. If you fall of a platform you also lose a live and when all lives are lost then it is game over. <br><br>To help you in your mission you are able to drop a detonation device that kills the nasties as well as question marks to collect which can give you extra lives, extra time and bonus points. Teleporters are scattered around the screen and when touched will transport you to another part of the screen. After every two levels are completed you enter a bonus level where there are no nasties but a time limit to try to get as much bonuses as you can.",
