  "description": "For Centuries, five huge prison ships floated around Zia in the Luma System, filled with prisoners whose uprising was quashed by Malik and the Wardens around Zan. Now believed to be just a story and if true the prisoners would be long dead, the story has become true as the five ships have arrived in orbit in Zan with large cargo's of mutated prisoners. To make matters worse, the prisoners have managed to eat through the hulls and are planning an escape. You have been assigned to send and control five Supertronic crafts to fly over the hulls of the five ships and seal all the holes as well as destroy any escaped prisoners. Each craft can be selected and controlled at any time. As well as the mutants to destroy or avoid, there are also defences on each ship and if touched or hit by a weapon then the craft loses power.<br><br>The five Supertronic crafts are able to transform into four different modes to help them in the their mission. The four modes are:<br><br><li>Hibar Mode: The craft shuts down all of it's systems and uses no power but can't be controlled. When a craft has run out of power it transforms into this mode and is lost.</li>\n<li>Solar Mode: When power is low, this mode activates solar panels to power back up and can be left to power up when other crafts are being controlled.</li>\n<li>Killar Mode: Enables the craft to use it's weapons to kill any mutants or destroy each ships defences. Weapon power pads can be collected when in Rovar Mode.</li>\n<li>Rovar Mode: This mode allows the craft to land on the hull of the ships via landing/take-off pads and seal any holes in the ships.</li>",
