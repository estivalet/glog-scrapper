  "description": "The name <i>Samurai Trilogy</i> refers to the fact that players can choose between three fighting styles: karate, kendo and samurai. In every of those disciplines the player gets confronted with six opponents, all with a different background and strengths. Before every fight the player chooses three training styles - examples being meditation, strength training or breath control - and the fight tactic emphasis (points divided to skill, speed, stamina and strength) for both attack and defense.<br><br>The fights itself offer no surprises: the player performs different moves and attacks (overall 16) and tries to outsmart his opponent. Everyone has a attack and defense bar and if one of the two runs out, the fight is over. Additionally there is a training mode available.",
