  "description": "In the year 6502 BC, Jesmon Hys from the city of Nodlon discovered the ancient Tombs of Ledromica  in the rich pastures of Tatseclus. Over the years of exploring the Tombs, Jesmon has discovered apart from treasures, that somewhere deep in the Tombs is a Temple dedicated to the worship of Rah. Too old to search for the Temple, Jesmon has written down his findings for the person who discovers them to continue his search for the Temple. <br><br>You play the role of Cuthbert who has discovered the writings of Jesmon and has decided to enter the Tombs to find treasure as well as the Temple. The game is a flick-screen maze game where you must search the various screens collecting treasure and bonuses while avoiding the monsters. You are armed and one shot is only needed to remove the monsters who appear after a few seconds after you enter a screen. Touching a monster loses you a life and you can only fire sideways. There are also doors that need opening with keys but you can only carry one key at a time.",
