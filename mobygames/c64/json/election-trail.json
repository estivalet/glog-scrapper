  "description": "<i>Election Trail</i> allows you to campaign to become the President of the United States of America on behalf of the Republican Party while the computer or another player battles against you for the Democrat Party for 20 periods. The screen is made up of one map of the USA and has two parts shown separately, a state map and a region map with each map having various options to choose from. Also on screen is the number of periods gone and how much funds you have which starts at 100. <br><br>You start the game choosing a state as your home and after seeing your oppositions state you then switch to the state map. You have a choice of four options which are Hold Rally (selected state), Campaign Tour (selected region), Media Campaign (selected region) and Invite Public Debate which asks you some questions on policies like are you in favour of tax reforms. After making a selection you are then presented with a region map and four more options, Seek Endorsement (International, Movie Star, Press and Home State), Try to Raise Funds, Ask for Opinion Poll and Call Press Conference. After your choices have been made then you watch the other player have a go before once again trying to raise votes and funds.<br><br>",
