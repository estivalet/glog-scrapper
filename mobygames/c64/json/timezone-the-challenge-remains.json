  "description": "<i>TimeZone: The Challenge Remains</i> is a side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls constantly from left to right as you control a spaceship to blast aliens over various levels. You are facing the Terrilon, a race of aliens attacking Earth and it's up to you to stop them by shooting and destroying them. If you are hit by any alien then you lose one of five lives and once you get to the end of a level it's off to the next. Two players can play and each player takes it in turn to play after the other player loses a life. You can select before the start of the game whether to have normal or random enemies.",
