  "description": "It is the future, and a holocaust has swept over the world.<br><br>Now, in a post-apocalyptic environment, you are set to destroy the evil Dr. A Noid, who had turned people to zombies with his artificial food called &quot;SLU&quot;.<br><br>First, you drive through the city with your ATV, destroying enemy vehicles and avoiding mines and gun turrets. There are several buildings you can explore.<br><br>In those buildings, you walk from room to room in a gauntlet-style setting, shooting zombies and avoiding traps. You'll find ammunition, food, and hopefully the pass to the Arena.<br><br>The Arena is the third part of the game: This is a deadly destruction derby where you have to steer your ATV through the treacherous maze and destroy all the enemy vehicles by pushing them into the holes in the ground.<br><br>After surviving the Arena, you'll proceed to the next city - until you get to face Dr. A Noid himself.",
