  "description": "<i>Magic of Endoria</i> takes place in the fantasy kingdom Endoria. Aeons ago the gods of Endoria were disgusted by the badness in the world and morphed themselves into crystal splinters and retreated into the underworld. Who gets all these splinters becomes the master of Endoria. Now two rival arch mages got aware of this myth and go on the search. You are one of them.<br><br>Of course you have to dig deep into the underground to find them. Your responsibility lies in the building. managing and defending of mines. To achieve this you hire employees with different professions: Craftsmen, researchers, mine workers, hauliers and warriors. These people want to see money for their work and they improve their abilities when they become experienced. <br><br>During the game you dig new alleys, equip them with traps, research new tools and fight against enemy troops to conquer their alleys. Later you have mutated creatures to your disposal.\nYou spend most of your time on a map with hexagonal fields. There you issue orders and set the routes of your employees.<br><br>The in 1994 released <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/magic-of-endoria\">DOS-version</a> is played in real time instead of turn based.",
