  "description": "In Rollin, you must move through a maze arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each of the boxes has a number in it – by crossing all four sides, that total is added to your score. Enemies are moving around the screen and must be avoided – contact will cost one of your three lives. However, once you enclose all four of the corner boxes, they change colour and can be ran into for a points bonus which doubles from the initial 100 each time.<br><br>The exact gameplay varies on each level. On odd-numbered screens, the levels are made up of dots, which can be eaten (for points) in any order. Even numbered screens are more restrictive – a section of line only remains ‘done’ if you then complete a box it is in contact with, without moving away from it.",
