  "description": "With a clear <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=James+Bond\">James Bond</a> influence, Sly Spy must stop terrorists destroying parts of the city in this collection of sub-games. Roughly half of these (starting with level 2, and alternating from there on) are side-scrolling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rushn-attack\">Green Beret</a>-influenced offerings, not entirely dissimilar to a great many Ocean movie licenses. There are bad guys to shoot and bullets to avoid, with boxes to climb up on and strategic positions to shoot from behind cover.<br><br>The first level involves skydiving down the screen and shooting at the agents as they themselves fall - complete this and you'll safely parachute to the ground. There's a motorbike chase, in which you must shoot out and dodge agents. Two underwater levels follow, in which more enemies and some sharks must be shot. Before reaching the final multiple-enemy showdown in a missile factory full of the baddies from the game.",
