  "description": "As the Empire's greatest Psychic, it is your mission to retrieve 24 stolen pieces of the statue of <i>Estra</i> the Snake God. The pieces have been placed in the secret Raal Temple on the planet Reonzar protected by various creatures. The Temple is viewed from above on a single screen and the pieces sit on the edge of the screen with a force field in the centre. You must collect the pieces, one piece at a time and take them into the force field through the gaps while avoiding the creatures who move in different ways. <br><br>On the top of the screen is an energy bar and this decreases slowly, so all pieces must be collected before your energy runs out. If your energy is getting low then you can enter a 3/4 circle to increase your energy bar. If you touch any creature, force field or the 3/4 circle then you lose one of five lives. Sitting in between the pieces of the statue are dots which also lose you a life if touched, but when it starts moving towards the centre of the screen then you can touch it to remove it. If any dot reaches the centre of the screen then you lose a life.",
