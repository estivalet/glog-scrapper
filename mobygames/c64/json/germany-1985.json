  "description": "First of SSI's &quot;When Superpowers Collide&quot; series. Strategic simulation of a conflict between US and Soviet forces. In Germany 1985 the Soviet forces attack NATO in West Germany in two different scenarios. In the first, Advance to Combat, Russian and US forces of similar strength race to establish a cohesive front line. The second scenario, Invasion, begins with Soviet airborne divisions landing behind NATO lines to block key roads and capture towns in preparation for the main advancing force. In both scenarios, the victory conditions are the same: the player controlling the greatest number of towns after a certain number of game turns is the winner. ",
