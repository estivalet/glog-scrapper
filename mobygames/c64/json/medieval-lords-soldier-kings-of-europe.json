  "description": "<i>Medieval Lords: Soldier Kings of Europe</i> is a political/war strategy simulator that starts (in its earliest scenario) in 1028 AD and continues for up to 100 turns or 500 years. Up to 10 players may take part, with the computer controlling up to 6 players. Limits can be set on how many actions can be performed in each turn, so be wary of over-expanding if there is not much time to give orders. Gameplay takes place in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, in a world full of conquests, diseases, and change.<br><br>The player takes the role of an immortal advisor to a king, caliph, sultan, or other leader, and must first manage domestic issues such as the economy and political stability, before attempting to conquer or form alliances with other regions. Random events such as plagues and religious orders ensure that each game is different.",
