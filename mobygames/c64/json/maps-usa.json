  "description": "Radarsoft created the educational program Maps USA for the US market and it was distributed by ACK, Inc. Maps USA teaches people in the States the geography of their own country.<br><br>There are three options to choose from, which are Search, Test and Heligame. In the Search mode the player can type in the names of the States, rivers, seas, mountains and the game will automatically go to the right place on the map. If there are several places with the similar name, then the computer will tell that the place was found, but will ask the player which one was meant. <br><br>In the Test mode the player has to name the places that has been pointed out by the computer in a certain time. In the heligame player controls a helicopter and must fly within a certain time limit to find the places indicated by the computer. Each place that have been found you'll get points. If the points are high enough, the player will get extra time and lesser known places in the next level.",
