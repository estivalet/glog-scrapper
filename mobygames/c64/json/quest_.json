  "description": "<i>The Quest</i> is a text adventure where the player's task is to find an ancient man of wisdom called The Maker and reunite him with his source of power. Like in other text adventures the player interacts with the world by entering two word commands made up of nouns and verbs such as &quot;go north&quot; and &quot;eat pie&quot;. Items found can be placed in a inventory with a &quot;get&quot; or &quot;take&quot; command but the maximum weight that can be carried is 50 lbs. The hero has a strength rating which decreases  for every move and it is therefore necessary to find food to eat and water to drink to regain it. Some food and water can be poisonous and has to be avoided since it will instead decrease the strength. The game consists of 120 rooms and 53 objects and ends with a 37 room maze. ",
