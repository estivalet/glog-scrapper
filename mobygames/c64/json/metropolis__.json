  "description": "Metropolis is a flick-screen platformer with some puzzle elements. Most screens have enemies following a straight path. Navigate through the screens and avoid touching any enemy, since that drains your energy. Find and collect items for later use. You can jump and open doors.<br><br>At first, you control the main character Moonboots the Lunar Explorer, who is stranded in Metropolis and must find his spaceship and refuel it to return to his home on the moon. During the game, Moonboots can change into three companions when carrying the right objects. They are Zoid the Droid, who is short enough to go under certain obstacles, Super Spy, and the Mad Monk. Some areas of the town are accessible to certain characters only, and some passages can only be traversed when you carry the right object.",
