  "description": "<i>2-Up: Macman / Keyboard Kaos .2.</i> is a double games pack that contains the following games:<br><br><b>Macman: </b>A single screen maze game viewed from above based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/pac-man\">Pac Man</a> where you have to eat all the dots in the maze to move to the next level. As you eat the dots, there are three ghosts also moving around the maze and these have to be avoided because if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. In each corner are power-pills and when eaten allow you to eat the ghosts for a short period of time.<br><br><b>Keyboard Kaos .2.: </b>A single screen typing game viewed from the side where you have to protect a city from fallen words released by alien invaders. As a word falls down the screen, you have to type it before it hits the ground. If a word hits the ground then you lose one of three lives. Before you start the game you can select a skill level (1-9) with one being the easiest.",
