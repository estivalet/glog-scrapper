  "description": "Piloting a small helicopter, you fly through a tunnel. The only way to control your vehicle is to keep pressing Fire, which causes it to move upwards; the faster you press, the faster the chopper gains height. You have therefore to adjust your tempo so that you won't collide with the tunnel walls. \n<i>Flapper</i> was an entry in the <a href=\"http://noname.c64.org/csdb/event/?id=1433\">1024 Bytes Game Compo 2nd Edition</a>, where it took 3rd place.
