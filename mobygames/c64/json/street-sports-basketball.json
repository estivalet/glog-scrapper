  "description": "Taking basketball out of poshly-decorated arenas with hotdog sellers, cheerleaders and pre-game entertainments, Epyx presented basketball played as it is by kids all over America. Four different courts are provided - the schoolyard, the alleyway, the parking lot and the backyard. Each of these has its own hazards to play around, such as oil slicks and potholes. The standard basketball dunks, passes and steals are on offer. An opposition player drilling the ball into you sees you gain possession.<br><br>One or two players can join in, choosing their team of 3 from the 10 kids you are offered, each with different abilities. There are 3 computer difficulty levels. ",
