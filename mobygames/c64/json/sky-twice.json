  "description": "The third planet of Zetta Kenntaury has been invaded and it's your job to walk along the planet over eight stages and kill all the invading aliens. The game is viewed from the side and the screen scrolls constantly from left to right. You have a laser to shoot any aliens as well as being able to jump to clear any obstacles. If you touch certain obstacles or any alien then you lose part of an energy bar before being sent back to the start of the stage you are on. Once the energy bar is empty then it's game over. As well as the main playing area you can see your score, stage and energy, and the joystick is used to control your hero.",
