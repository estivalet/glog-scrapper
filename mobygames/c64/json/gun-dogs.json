  "description": "The goal of this two-player game is to shoot as many ducks as possible and retrieve them with the help of your dog to score a higher score than your opponent. You and your opponent control a hunter and a dog. When the hunter aims at a duck, press the fire button to shoot the duck with one of the barrels of the shotgun. But if you miss, press the fire button again to fire with the other barrel. Steer your dog to retrieve the duck with the use of your joystick and place the duck in the basket at the hunter's feet.\n \nDucks can fall on land or in the water. The difficulty for the dogs to retrieve the ducks changes. This is also the reason for the different number of points awarded;\n \n<li>Duck falls on land – 10 points.\n<li>Duck falls in water – 40 points.\n<li>Duck falls on the island – 100 points.</ul>\n \nThe difficulty level increases with;\n \n<li>Floating tree trunks: The dog has to dodge them.\n \n<li>Fish: They can bite and drive the dog into the river. You then will need a new dog.\n \n<li>When swimming the river be careful of the current or you will be swept away</ul>\n<br><br><br>In level 4 you get a new obstacle; a fox will sometimes appear and steal a duck from the basket. You can chase him away with your dog, but if a duck is stolen, you lose 10 points.",
