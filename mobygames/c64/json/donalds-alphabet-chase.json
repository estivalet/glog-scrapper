  "description": "<i>Donald's Alphabet Chase</i> is an educational game for children ages 2-5 featuring Donald Duck. Donald's alphabet letters have escaped and are now hiding throughout the house! You need to help Donald locate all 26 of the letters and put them back in place. By pressing a letter on the keyboard, an animation is displayed where Donald finds and catches that letter. There are six different screens a letter may be hiding on, and each letter features a different animation. When all of the letters have been collected, the game is over and a bonus screen is displayed.",
