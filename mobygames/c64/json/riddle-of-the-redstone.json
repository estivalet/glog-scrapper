  "description": "Mr. Dillworth sees his end coming and so he decides to make his will. But which of the possible charity organisations should get it all? Of course the one who can solve his riddles! As the last of the candidates, the player receives three hints and searches Dillworth's premises...<br><br><i>Riddle of the Redstone</i> is closer to a choose-your-own-adventure than a traditional text adventure. While the player still enters the commands into a parser, there are only two or three available at a time. If the first try does not fit the options, the game explicitly lists the available choices. After entering a command, a text describes what is happening and leads to the next decision point. For example, after starting a game the player needs to choose which of three hints to follow first which locks the path the game follows next.<br><br>Depending on the choices made, the player may die or lose the game. Then it is necessary to either load an old save or start all over. Occasionally the player finds bags which show the progress of the current puzzle: the green bag means good, the yellow caution and the red failure. While the majority of the game is text-only, sometimes a picture is shown to illustrate the text.",
