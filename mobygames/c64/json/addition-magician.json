  "description": "<i>Addition Magician</i> is an educational game teaching math aimed at players aged six to ten. The game is built around a cube that there are nine numbers within. The player's task is to draw walls around the numbers so that a certain target sum is reached in every created box. So for example if the sum should be six, the players has to draw walls around five plus one, two plus four, one plus two plus three etc. Each game consists of a preselected number of boards that have to be completed. If the player succeeds with all boards he is awarded a prize. Before starting a game it is also possible to choose a target sum and how fast the game should be when playing against the clock. The game can be played by one or two players. In the two player mode the screen is split and each player has his own game board and the one that finish first wins.",
