  "description": "<i>Kong</i> is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Donkey+Kong+variants\">Donkey Kong</a>.<br><br>This is a single player game that can be played with joystick or keys. The aim of the game is to achieve a high score by rescuing Fay Ray from the clutches of King Kong. There are four levels in this game. In the first screen Kong rolls barrels towards the player who can smash them with a hammer to gain bonus points. <br>\nThe second screen is set in a pie factory and the player must hurdle oncoming pies on a conveyor belt. Level three has the player pursuing Kong up the sky scraper in lifts while avoiding falling girders and the last level is set in Kong's lair.<br>\nEach level starts with a set number of bonus points which count down over time so the faster the screen is completed the more points are gained.  Umbrellas and handbags can also be collected for bonus points.",
