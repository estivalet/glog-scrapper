  "description": "<i>Alphabet Zoo</i> is a top-view educational game where the player races around a maze. It is up to the player to collect the letters scattered around. The maze also contains two teleporters that warp the player who uses them to a random spot. <br><br>Each maze has a graphic representation of an object in the middle. There are two modes: Game 1, where the player needs to repeatedly collect first letter of the object's name as many times as possible within the time limit, and Game 2, where all the letters oft he name must be collected in the correct order. The game can be played in one-player mode, or with two competing players. The game allows to start from any level and choose uppercase letters only, lowercase letters only, or a mix of both. ",
