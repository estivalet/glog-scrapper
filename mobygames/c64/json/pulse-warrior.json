  "description": "Who needs weaponry when you're trying to save the earth from the invasion of the beings of Cirrus Major? Hopefully you don't, because the method of fending off the attack across the 108 zones of the game is rather more unusual.<br><br>The Earth of the 22nd century has massive solar platforms for receiving energy direct from the sun, and these produce massive pulses of energy discharge. The idea is that you fly into these and direct them at angles so as to hit and destroy the Cirran invaders. The more pulses you have touched before unleashing a shot, the more powerful it will be, but you must be careful not to cause your ship to overheat.",
