  "description": "<i>3-D Glooper</i> is a version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> where you must move about a maze-like city eating blue blocks while trying to avoid the baddies called Gloopers that roam it. You can only escape once all the blocks are gone. Occasionally a red block will appear which for a short time allows you to eat the Gloopers.<br><br>The game is viewed from a first person perspective. As well as the main playing area the number of lives, High Score, Score, and a timer can be seen at the top of the screen. Pressing F1 also brings up a map showing the location of any Gloopers and blue blocks left to eat at the top of the screen.",
