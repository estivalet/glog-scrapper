  "description": "<i>Blue Powder Grey Smoke</i> is a strategy war game based upon the American Civil War.<br><br>1-player versus computer or 2-player strategy game played in semi-real time.  The player can choose from a number of historical and non-historical missions, from either the Confederate or Union perspective.  In the non-historical setting, the positioning of troops and the characteristics of reinforcements are randomized, so as to not represent the original battle conditions. Gameplay uses a number of historically accurate types of arms. During play, the player can move between 3 different zoom levels to monitor the action of their troops in realtime, but the action can be paused at any time to issue commands.  Commands are issued via a menu system, and the player can choose objectives for their individual troops, as well as the speed, offensive, and defensive positions they wish them to take.  <br><br>",
