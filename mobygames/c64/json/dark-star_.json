  "description": "The player controls a ship, which must locate and destroy the Dark Star. The object is to stay on the one transport channel, shooting obstacles that get in its way. The catch is the channel divides into two paths, and you must decide what route to travel on. The catch is that only one path leads to the center where the Dark Star is located, and if you choose the wrong route, you will come to a dead end. You only get one life, meaning that if you crash into a wall or an obstacle, the game ends.\n",
