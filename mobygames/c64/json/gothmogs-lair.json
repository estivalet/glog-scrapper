  "description": "<i>Gothmog's Lair</i> is an interactive fiction adventure in a fantasy setting. There are no general location graphics; instead there are small animated graphics of key moments. The game includes character interaction and is 'real-time', meaning the other characters (such as animals and thieves) move around at the same time as you do. However, movement and combat are turn-based - you make a move, then the NPCs do. Commands include MOVE, GET and ATTACK, requiring two-letter direction initials.",
