  "description": "In this sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/its-clean-up-time\">It's Clean-Up Time</a>, Bobban and Otto are once again two wacky cleaners who have managed to get the contract to clean the Addle Hotel. One or two players can play this platform game with each level showing a large part of the hotel. They must run around each level to clean and avoid the mutant rubbish or lose a life each time they are touched by the rubbish. There are key objects scattered around to help them keep the hotel clean like dustbin lids, stun guns and brooms. Help them work their way through eight levels to finish in the haunted attic.<br><br> ",
