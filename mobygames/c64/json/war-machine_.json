  "description": "On a distant outpost of the Empire, your mission is to protect the remaining Neutronium deposits from an alien invasion force over various levels. The game is a single screen shooter viewed from the side at an elevated angle, and with your defence vehicle you must drive along the surface of the outpost blasting alien crafts in the sky above avoiding their weapons. As you blast the aliens you must also blast any automated mining vehicles driving along the surface trying to find Neutronium to mine even though there is no longer any to mine. As well as driving left or right you can drive in and out of the screen between rows and columns of rocks. If you are hit by the alien crafts weapons or hit a mining vehicle then you lose one of three lives.",
