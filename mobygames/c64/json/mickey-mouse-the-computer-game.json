  "description": "The Ogre King and his minions have taken over Disney Castle, and it's Mickey's task to win it back. The game starts on a sequence of stairways, up which Mickey must move, shooting any creatures that get in his way. Eventually you will come to a door and go through it, at which point the second section of the game begins.<br><br>These are viewed from above, and see Mickey negotiate his way through a multi-screen maze, with multiple exits on each screen. Ghosts and ogres block his path, but he's armed with a water pistol for the former and an axe for the latter, both of which need replenishing regularly. Some doors require keys to move through.<br><br>There are several sub-games, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Donkey+Kong\">Donkey Kong</a>-derived games. To win the game you must finally beat the Ogre King.",
