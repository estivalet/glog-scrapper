  "description": "<i>Marathon</i> is an one or two player educational game using maths where two runners have to race each other to reach the finish line before the other racer to win the game. The game has four skill levels (Walker, Jogger, Sprinter and Olympian) and the option to choose which type of problems (Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction or all four) can be selected before the race. In a one player game, the player competes against the computer, while two players play against each other on the same track. The screen is split into four parts with the top part showing the two racers, second part shows the next question, third part shows the available answers and the initials of the racer, the bottom part shows the time and the best result so far. <br><br>Once the race begins a question appears and using a 3 x 3 grid full of numbers, the player moves the number one to the correct number and presses the fire button within a short time limit. If the answer is correct then the player's racer moves one place but if wrong or the player doesn't answer quickly enough, then the computer moves one place. In a two player game, both players move either the number one or two to the correct answer in separate grids and the first player to press the fire button moves one place if the answer is correct.",
