  "description": "Shark is a 2D-horizontal-scrolling arcade shoot-em-up comparable to games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/x-out\">X-Out</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Katakis\">Katakis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/delta-patrol\">Delta</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/armalyte\">Armalyte</a>. Your craft is armed with a small phased plasma armour piercing laser weapon. Upgrade your craft with objects you can collect dropped from exploding enemy crafts. Collect mines, missiles, bouncing bombs, wire-guided missiles, shields, extra energy, plasma blasters, or a high power generator to speedup your craft. Avoid contact with enemy craft which drain your energy. A panel displayed at the top of the screen will give you essential information like energy level, weapon system in use, Score, Lives left, Remaining ammunition of Weapon. ",
