  "description": "Dante's poem 'Inferno' details a man's journey through hell, in the hope of reaching purgatory. This computer game interpretation takes the form of a mazelike arcade adventure. You can hold two objects at a time, to use towards solving the puzzles. The objects you need are located in the initial forest, so lots of backtracking is required. <br><br>Cross the River Styx through the boatman to reach the nine circles of hell. These represent people who will not go to Heaven based on Christian theologies, from non-Christians to those who breached the Seven Deadly Sins such as sloth and gluttony. Contact with these must be avoided if you are to prove yourself pure enough to enter purgatory.",
