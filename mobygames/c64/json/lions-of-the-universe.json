  "description": "Lions of the Universe is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up set in space, with a feel resembling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/armalyte\">Armalyte</a> in many ways. Players battle through a mazey territory, collecting tokens (which are left in the open, rather than collected form shot enemies) to improve weaponry. Enemies come towards you in waves and individually.",
