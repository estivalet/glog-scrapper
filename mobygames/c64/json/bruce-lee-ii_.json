  "description": "An unofficial port of an unofficial sequel: <em>Bruce Lee II</em> was <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/bruce-lee-ii\">first released for Windows and Linux</a> in 2013, as a fan-made tribute to the <a id=\"de7f1f78ebf1bb70977c33a8fa2976825\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bruce+Lee\">original platforming classic</a>, complete with a selectable &quot;C64&quot; graphical style.  Another programmer then picked up the gauntlet, resulting in this native Commodore 64 conversion.  The game keeps faithful to the original, as far as hardware limitations allow, but also introduces a new, easier difficulty setting (which demands less pixel-perfect platforming skills and starts out with ten lives, instead of five).<br><br>As Bruce Lee ventures into the depth of Tao-Bao's palace to rescue his captive sister, he is beset by a gang of mercenaries that follow him from room to room, challenging his considerable martial arts skills with their own.  En route towards the final confrontation with Tao-Bao himself, the Dragon's path will take him from the palace garden, through underground pools (Bruce can now swim and dive), temples, pagodas and even a brief imprisonment in the dungeons.<br><br>Along the way, passages will have to be opened up by engaging in the familiar pastime of collecting hanging lanterns; devious and dynamic traps make things difficult for our hero, but environmental aids like traveling platforms, poles, vines, conveyor belts, and the idiosyncratic moving tapestries can be deftly exploited to avoid the hazards.",
