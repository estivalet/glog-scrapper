  "description": "<i>Sensitive</i> is an action puzzle game with a very simple premise. The player controls a ball which has to roll over a set of platforms to the exit. The trick is that each tile disappears after the player has rolled over it. This requires careful planning of which path to take across the platforms to get tot the goal.<br><br>Each level is a single screen with grey and yellow tiles. Rolling over the yellow tiles will cause them to disappear, the grey tiles won't dissolve when the ball rolls over them. Later levels introduce special tiles, like tiles you can roll over twice, one-way tiles and teleporters<br><br>There are no level passwords so each new game starts from the very beginning with a fixed set of 4 lives.",
