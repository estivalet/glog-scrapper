  "description": "<i>Action Biker</i> is a game that uses the character Clumsy Colin from the British comic Buster, and he was also used as the mascot for the crisp range KP Skips. You take control of Colin on his motorbike and you must ride around an isometric 360 degree landscape to collect various clothing items and bike parts to enter a drag race. There are various obstacles to avoid and these include walls, fences, trees, telegraph poles, a petrol station and water and if you crash into any then you lose one of five lives. There are also raised platforms that can be negotiated but you are able to jump from them safely. Once you have collected all the items required, you can make your way to the drag strip to race.",
