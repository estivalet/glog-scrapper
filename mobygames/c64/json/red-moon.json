  "description": "The Red Moon Crystal is the only source of Magik in the land, and stabilizes the forces of the world. This crystal has been stolen and as a result, the land has fallen into chaos. A single powerful magician is sent to rescue the Crystal from the castle where it's hidden. <br><br><i>Red Moon</i> is an graphical interactive fiction game. Players assume the role of the wizard on his quest to recover the crystal. They will have the use of many weapons and a dozen magical spells. Combat is a key element of the game: both the magician and enemy opponents have hit points, in the style of RPGs. Spellcasting requires certain objects to be collected, and many spells must also be cast on a specific target. Various objects will be found during the adventure, including garlic, pills and a mask.",
