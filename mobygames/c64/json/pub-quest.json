  "description": "After a heavy night of drinking in your local pub it is time to pay the bill but you have no money on you and the landlord wants his money. The only location you know that has some money is in the sewers, but with many dangers and you not quite sober, you need to search and find the right equipment to go into the sewers for the money. To make matters worse, you have a certain time (choice of one, two and three hours) to pay your bill or the debt collectors will arrive. <i>Pub Quest</i> is a text adventure where there is text on the screen describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.",
