  "description": "<i>Colossus Chess 2?0</i> is a computer program that allows you to play the computer at a game of chess. The rules of chess are followed and includes the moves 'Castling' and 'En-passent'. As well as a normal game there are various options that can be chosen to further enhance the experience of the program. You can play as either white or black as well as just allow the computer to play itself. The whole board is shown on the screen viewed from above but there is another screen that shows you all the moves that have been played as well as various stats on how the computer is thinking. The board can be set up to allow you to place the pieces in various places as well as play various check positions to solve. A tournament mode can be set up by adjusting the time allowed for each move to be played.",
