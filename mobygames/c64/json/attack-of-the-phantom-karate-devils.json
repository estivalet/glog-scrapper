  "description": "<i>The Attack of the Phantom Karate Devils</i> is a fighting game where the player has to defeat an army of shadow-like creatures who have murdered the player's master. The game is played from a side view and the joystick is used to control the hero. Different kicks and punches (high or low) can be used with points being earned for each hit. There are also thrown knifes and stars that have to be avoided or blocked.  Upon reaching certain scores doors are opened that takes the player to new levels. Strength points are lost when getting struck but also when attacking. If the strength reaches zero the player dies but it is recharged when moving through a door. ",
