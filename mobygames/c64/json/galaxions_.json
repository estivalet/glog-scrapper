  "description": "<i>Galaxions</i> is based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/galaxian\">Galaxian</a> where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, to destroy alien invaders above. The aliens sit in a formation and move across the screen left to right and back again dropping bombs to destroy you. Occasionally a couple of aliens will break from formation and swoop down and when they move off the bottom of the screen they appear at the top again. If you are hit by an alien or a bomb then you lose one of three lives and once you destroy all the aliens then they appear again in formation.",
