  "description": "The Zyroneans were an advanced, pacifistic civilization until the arrival of the tyrant Kayleth. Sending down armies of androids from his space ship, he enslaved the planet Zyron and forced its inhabitants to work in mines and gather Chromazin, a rare mineral, for him. You are a Zyronean who has made a plan to free the planet from Kayleth' reign. However, as the game begins, you find yourself trapped in an unknown place with no memory of the events that led you to this situation. In order to find out where you are, what happened to you and ultimately save your home planet, you will have to interact with several (android) characters, solve various puzzles and survive encounters with ferocious creatures.",
