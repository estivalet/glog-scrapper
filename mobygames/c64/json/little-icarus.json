  "description": "<i>Little Icarus</i> is a side view horizontal scrolling game where the screen scrolls constantly from right to left over five levels as you control Icarus trying to catch up with his Father Daedalus. You must fly across the lands of Greece while avoiding various creatures like birds and bees, as you try to catch up with your Father without losing all your energy. On top of the screen is an energy bar and this increases faster, the higher you are in the air so flying close to the ground slows it down. Clouds move from left to right at the top of the screen and this increases your energy bar when touched. On the ground as well as buildings, ships and trees is a cat which moves along the ground and occasionally jumps when you are close to the ground. If you touch any creature then you are moved downwards a short distance and if you hit the ground, objects or your energy bar fills then you lose one of five lives. Pressing the fire button pauses the game and shows your progress as well as the high score.",
