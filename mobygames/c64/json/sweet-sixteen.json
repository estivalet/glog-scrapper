  "description": "A nasty piece of work, the player here controls the actions of a &quot;player&quot; -- a love-'em-and-leave-'em high school Lothario at Kenwood Academy who takes on a bet from his neanderthal friends of Chicago's Hyde Park area to seduce Nova Tilland, a stunningly gorgeous transfer student from Lab School... and to produce proof.  A $500 wager hangs in the balance.<br><br>Taking advantage of her good nature, the player confabulates a sob story about having a vehicular breakdown in front of her house.  She lets the player in to use the phone, through which his co-conspirators arrange for a tow truck to arrive in four hours, granting the player a window of opportunity to realise the dirty deed.<br><br>Given free rein to wander the house, the player must rustle up some means of documenting their conquest and come up with a scheme by which to distract Nova's father, a dangerous opponent personified in-game as an avid subscriber to &quot;Sniper, the Magazine for Gunmen&quot;.  That done, only navigation of an unlit area and the obligatory secret passage interfere with access to the squalid endgame, an unfortunate ends-justify-the-means exercise in bondage and coercion in a basement dungeon.",
