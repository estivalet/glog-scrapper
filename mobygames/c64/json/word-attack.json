  "description": "<i>Word Attack!</i> is a vocabulary learning game for multiple systems.<br><br>Contains 9 levels of vocabulary, and the player can chose to learn adjectives, adverbs, or nouns.  Players can review words and their meaning, and there is a multiple choice quiz and fill in the blank option.  <br><br>Finally, there is a game component called <i>Word Attack!</i>.  In this game, the player controls a small gnome who moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen.  A definition appears, and the player must shoot the appropriate definition with their hat before the timer on the right runs out.  As the player answers questions, the timer begins to drain quicker.  Every 5 correct answers in a row, the player advances a level, and the player receives 100 x the current level in points for each correct answer.  After all time has expired, the player receives a final score.  <br><br>",
