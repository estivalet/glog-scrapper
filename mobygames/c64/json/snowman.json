The objective of the game is to build a snowman which is done by collecting various items and then dropping them off at the right location. This includes snow, clothes, toys and ice. At the same time it's necessary to eat food to stay awake and avoid gas flames which melt the carried snow and ice. It's possible to freeze gas flames by picking up an ice lolly. There are also sleep monsters who send the player to bed if an alarm clock is not carried. The game contains four stages with different items that needs to be collected.",
