  "description": " <i>Mind Warp</i> is a space strategy action game suggesting that 3 hours of play are required to gain proficienncy with all functions, with obvious Star Trek influences. Ceta Major is under attack from Romulans and Klingons, and as the commander on board spaceship Excellence, it is your job to repel them.<br><br>Ceta Major is split into an 8x8 grid, and your scanners tell you how many Klingon and Super Klingon ships, Star Bases and Stars are in each neably sector (central areas of the block thus yield more info, but give enemies more chances to attack), while the Romulans only show on your short-range scanner.  Klingons take 2 hits to be destroyed (and can destroy you with two shots - keep an eye on the damage report), Super Klingons 3 hits, and Romulan ships 5 hits (but have less powerful weaponry). Your phasers are more powerful than your torpedos, but their use takes up energy. Visit star bases to charge up your power and reload weapons - planets do the same but can only be visited once.",
