  "description": "Like in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/911-ts\">ZX Spectrum version</a>, you control a Porsche 911TS fitted with Dunlop tyres.<br>\nThe gameplay is however different from the Spectrum version, you must travel along the road, while picking up passengers and taking them to their house. If your car travels on the grass, you do some damage. You can press the fire button on the joystick to make the car stop, which is useful for turning around and driving in a different direction. The game ends when the damage gauge reaches 300, or when your time expires.",
