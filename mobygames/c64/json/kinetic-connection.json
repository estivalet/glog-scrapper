  "description": "In <i>Kinetic Connection</i> you are presented with an array of blocks on one of 16 MicroKinema (levels), which are split from a square grid. Pick up, rotate and place the objects to form a mystery image in the grid. You can display the actual image you are attempting to mirror, but your limited fund of time depletes more quickly while this is visible. <br><br>Puzzles can be broken down into between 4 and 96 pieces. Many of the MicroKinema are animated, which gives you clues as to what should be placed where, and which way up.<br><br>Quick thinking and creativity are the keys. The puzzles can be saved, and played alone or with a friend.",
