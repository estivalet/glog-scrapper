  "description": "<i>The Match</i> is a football management game where you have to guide a football team from the English 4th Division to become champions of the 1st Division and win other cups as well. There are a choice of 40 teams to choose from, with each division only containing 10 teams each. On the main menu screen there is information about your team and various options. To help you in your quest to become champions you can select your players to play, train the team, get physio reports, and buy and sell players. The bank, league tables and fixtures can be checked also. Once you are happy with your selections it is on to the match which consists of viewing a whole football pitch from the side at an elevated angle. With the players moving around the pitch there is text below describing incidents that occur over the 90 minutes. You can pause the match as well as speed or slow it down.",
