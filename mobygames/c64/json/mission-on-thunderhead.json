  "description": "From the author of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/maxwell-manor\">Maxwell Manor</a>, <i>Mission on Thunderhead</i> is an action game with a science-fiction theme. <br><br>Thunderhead is a once-desolate planet now teeming with life, thanks to the hated Eternals. They have set up an underground complex, which is their main power base. <br><br>The game is split into two parts - Operation Tempest and The Final Appeal. In Operation Tempest you must find and activate the device needed to destroy the planet. In The Final Appeal you must find the items which will allow you to appeal the charges the Eternals hit you with.<br><br>Gameplay involves jumping and shooting - the player must collect the items which allow you to defeat monsters. There are also mazelike sections. Weapon power-ups and reloads can be found, as can extra lives. The game has 10 preset levels, and a seed number to allow over 1000 variations of play.",
