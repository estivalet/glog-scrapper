  "description": "<em>F1 GP Circuits</em> is a single-player Formula 1 arcade racing game. The only available mode is the actual Grand Prix season, as a sequence of five-lap races on several circuits around the world, each preceded by a qualification lap. The player can choose the car manufacturer, pilot and country to race for: as the game is not an official F1 licensee, several names are word plays of actual companies.<br><br>At the core of the game is the need to quickly react to upcoming turns or approaching cars: the game scrolls only vertically but the viewport is stretched horizontally, which gives the player very little visibility, though the game does signal upcoming turns. It is essential for the player to optimize pit stops for refuelling and repairs. Upgrades can be purchased after each race with the money earned by placing in the higher ranks.",
