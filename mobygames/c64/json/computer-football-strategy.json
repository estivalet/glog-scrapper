  "description": "<i>Computer Football Strategy</i> is modeled after Avalon Hill’s board game based on American style football.  Players can select from a wide roster of professional teams spanning from the 1966 Green Bay Packers to 1982 Washington Redskins.  Naturally this is a strategy game where players choose from many formations for offense and defense to setup each down.  Once selected the down is played out in top down animation style with the plays outcome and stats.  The game supports both: player versus computer or two player mode.",
