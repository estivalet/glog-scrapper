  "description": "Earth has been invaded by extraterrestrial shapechanging robots which have made our planet their battleground. The struggle between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons centers around energy as the objective is to collect four pieces of the Energon Cube and getting them back to the Autobot base. The Decepticons will do their best to get in the way and use the cubes to their own nefarious means.<br><br>You as the player control five Autobots that can either be in robot or vehicle form. You move around the platforms searching for the cubes. While in robot form you can either walk or fly, but while in vehicle form you drive around the platforms. Defensa-Pod can be used to switch between Autobots. <br><br>Once all the cubes are collected the game repeats at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Each Autobot has shields that deplete when shot at or hit by an enemy Decepticon, when all the Autobots are destroyed, it is Game Over.<br><br>\nThe Commodore 64 uses a scrolling playfield, while the Spectrum uses a flip-screen technique.",
