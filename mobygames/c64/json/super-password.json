  "description": "Super Password was a popular game show that ran from 1984-1989, and this game was adapted from that television program. Players give and receive clues to 5 Passwords which, when all are listed on the board, suggest the identity of the person, place, thing, event, phrase, etc., that is the Super Password.<br><br>Each game consists of three to four rounds. The first round is worth $100, the second $200, the third $300, and the fourth (if necessary) $400. The first player to win $500 (or more) wins the game. The winner gets to play the Final Round for $10,000. To play the Final Round, the winning player must guess the ten Passwords as each one's initial letter is highlighted at the bottom of the stand. Each word is worth $100, but a special bonus of $10,000 is awarded if all ten are guessed.",
