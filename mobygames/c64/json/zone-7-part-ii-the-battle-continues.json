  "description": "<i>Zone 7</i> is a shoot'em up that reminds a bit of Asteroids, but is played different. Like Asteroids, you spawn in the middle of the screen. Unlike Asteroids, your shots do not travel through the border of the screen and come back on the other side, but they bounce of the edge of the playing area and then keep flying until they hit the border again. Three shots can be flying around at a time. And the biggest difference is: your enemies don't split up. ",
