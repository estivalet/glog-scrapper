  "description": "<i>NetRacer</i> is the first multiplayer racing game for the Commodore 64 and it is available for up to eight players over the internet or a LAN. Using a top-down perspective, each car has a different colour and the game keeps tracks of the score (based on the distance travelled and laps completed) and damage, and features music and sound effects. Cars slow down when colliding with opponents or the edges of the track. Damage is restored by completing a lap.<br><br>The game was first unveiled at the Cincinnati Commodore Computer Club Expo 2008. It was built on the network code of <a id=\"da2e0c4e906f1780fbab6b78488c68deb\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Artillery+Duel\">Artillery Duel</a> by the same developers. The server it runs on is JAVA based and platform independent.",
