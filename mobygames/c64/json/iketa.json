  "description": "<i>Iketa</i> is a one-on-one fighting game. It offers both a two-player mode, and a one-player mode with several difficulty levels. <br><br>In the one-player mode, the player faces a progression of enemies, all of whom are ninjas wearing variously colored outfits. The player must win two rounds in each fight to move on to the next opponent. There are a number of moves available, such as a high kick or a jumping kick. Each battle lasts a maximum of 80 seconds; if the timer runs out, the game is over. ",
