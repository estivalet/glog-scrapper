  "description": "<i>Monster Munch</i> is a top view single screen maze game based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/pac-man\">Pac-Man</a> where you guide Munchie around the maze eating all the dots to move to the next level. As you move and eat, there are four monsters that also move around the maze and these must be avoided because if they touch you then you lose one of three lives. To help you, there are four power-pills in each corner and when eaten allow you to eat the monsters who have now turned blue for a limited time. When a monster is eaten then his eyes move to the center of the maze and re-appears as a normal monster trying to eat you again. A question mark makes an occasional appearance and when eaten gives you bonus points.",
