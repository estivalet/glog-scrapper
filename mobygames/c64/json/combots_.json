  "description": "<i>Combots</i> is a 1 - 2 player strategy war game for the Commodore 64/128.<br><br>In 2005, aliens landed and launched a world-wide campaign of domination.  Their Pulse Signal destroyed and neutralized nuclear stockpiles and eliminated most forms of communication between the continents and nations.  We were isolated, but we fought back.  The aliens came in armored machines that walked and flew, but humans built their own from scrap iron and spare parts.  From captured alien robots, we have learned their technological secrets, to wage war against the aliens.<br><br>This is a strategy based combat game involving large robots.  Combat occurs on a hexagonal map containing a variety of terrains.  Gameplay is turn-based with the player and computer forces taking turns moving troops.  The player controls shield powers and defensive capabilities of their fort.  A tactical vector display shows location and threat of enemy troops.  Combat can occur at long range involving cannon and missile fire, but there are also options for close combat between troops involving hand-to-hand combat.  Vehicles can be temporarily deactivated to enact repairs.  Destroyed enemy vehicles can be salvaged, at risk of self-destruction damaging the player's base.    <br><br>The player can make custom robots to pilot.  The player chooses from several different head, torso, and legs, as well as chooses the means of locomotion of the vehicle.  The player can choose the armor capacity of individual sections, and must place the location and strength of the vehicle's command center.  The player can then create custom ammunition for the robot, and place it on their vehicle.",
