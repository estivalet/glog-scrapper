Rufus attempts to defeat them by putting on a cape and learning to use magic spells.<br><br><p>Rufus moves around a landscape made up of platforms and ladders, avoiding or fighting enemies including witches, demons and vikings. First a number of prisoners must be freed from cages on each level, and then the exit must be found. Magic spells (which include weapons, and the key to open cages) can be bought from Spell Stalls or just found lying around. Chests provide coins to be spent at the Spell Stalls.",
