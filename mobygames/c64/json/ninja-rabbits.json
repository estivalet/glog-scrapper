  "description": "The rabbit you control has ninja skills and an appropriate costume. <i>Ninja Rabbits</i> is a platform game where you usually go to the right, except sometimes you must go down into the sewers or metro and fight there. Enemies on various levels include street thugs, ninjas, bears and frogs.<br><br>Most screens have more than one enemy, but you only fight one at a time. Be careful to avoid the bouncing dots, as these sap your energy. This is depicted as a carrot which gets smaller as it fades - collect extra carrots to recharge it.\n",
