  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/moebius-the-orb-of-celestial-harmony\">Moebius</a>, <i>Windwalker</i> combines role-playing with side-view beat 'em up gameplay. You are accompanied by Moebius on a quest to master the martial arts.<br><br>Hostile persons including thieves, guards and assassins will be encountered; you fight them in real time using moves such as cartwheels and flying kicks. This can be played either as a continuous battle, or with short breaks to catch your composure.<br><br>The role-playing elements eschew the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ultima\">Ultima</a>-style plan view in favor of a pseudo-3D system. Deism and Shamanism are just some of the included magic disciplines. Magical vehicles help you get around the 100 landscapes more quickly, although you spend much time on foot. The game takes place in a fully active universe of characters such as villagers and giant beetles, all getting about their business within a day/night cycle and variable weather.",
