  "description": "New York in the future is a dangerous place with criminals wandering the streets and causing havoc. The Mayor is desperate for any sort of help and you are the answers to his prayers. You are Tom Essex and you have drunk a bottle of formula invented by your uncle which turned you into Superkid. You now have the ability to fly and you have a Super Punch which knocks-out the criminals with one punch. You must explore three parts of the city stopping the criminals but also finding and rescuing girls on top of the roof-tops and taking them back home. There are also Grannys to escort from the Library to their home. Be careful not to touch the Grannys or you will kill them. <br><br>You have a set quota of how many to rescue and if you complete your quota then it's on to the next level. If you hit a criminal, get shot, have a granny or girl killed then your Crimewave Overload meter rises and if it reaches the top then you lose one of three lives. If you punch a criminal or rescue a girl or granny then the meter decreases.  Once you have completed three levels then you repeat them but this time at night with more people to rescue and with more criminals and faster ones.<br><br><i>Superkid</i> is a flick-screen platform game with part of the level shown on the screen for one or two players. Each player takes it in turns when the other player loses a life. As well as the main playing area you can also your score, number of lives, your rescue quotas and your Crimewave Overload meter. A joystick or keyboard can be used to control your hero.\n",
