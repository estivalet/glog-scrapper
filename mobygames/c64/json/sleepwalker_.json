  "description": "Your Uncle Silas lives in a run down large house with lots of hazards everywhere. The problem you have though is that your Uncle sleepwalks and with all those obstacles scattered around you need to stop him from hitting the hazards so he doesn't wake up and suffer from a mental trauma. First you need to find him in this large house. Once your Uncle is located the only way to help him back to bed is to suffer the hazards yourself. While hurting yourself you can stand in front of Silas to send him the direction to bed. He must be returned to bed before the time runs out.<br><br><i>Sleepwalker</i> is a one-player, flick-screen game. On the screen you can see each room with the various hazards scattered around like cables, tacks and dynamite. Also on the screen is your score and a large clock showing your time left. The joystick is used to control your character.<br><br>",
