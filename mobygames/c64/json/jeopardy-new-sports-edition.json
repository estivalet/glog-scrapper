Categories include everything from the Olympic Sports, such as Gymnastics, Swimming and Track to Football, Golf and Baseball. You can play one-on-one with the computer, or challenge up to two other sports fans to a game. Three players compete against each other by coming up with the question for a given answer. There are two rounds of play each with six categories of answers, and one final round consisting of a single answer. Each correct question given can be worth from $100 to $1000 for the player to respond first, or if a daily double is uncovered the player to find it may bet up to the current amount of money they have. The player with the most money at the end wins. Jeopardy! features a high scores table so players can save their characters wins and losses, different male and female character animations to choose from, and of course a wide variety of answers and questions.
