  "description": "A musical game with four modes:\n<ul>\n<li>Catch a Coco-Note - Pick notes out of a pool with your fishing pool. Once you've picked enough you can hear the band play the melody you've picked out.</li>\n<li>Composin' Coco-Notes - Same game as the first, except now played with an accompaniment.</li>\n<li>Beat The Clam - Race against a clam trying to claim notes from the pool and get a high score while finishing the song. Collect bonus notes for extra score and avoid the clam as he'll eat your fishing line as well.</li>\n<li>Beat The Clam -- Challenge - Same game as above except the clam is much faster.</li>\n</ul>",
