  "description": "Take the role of a US Navy SEAL operative and embark in 3 missions involving terrorists, hostages, and the like. The plot is fairly superficial, since each mission is independent from the rest.<br><br>Each mission has several &quot;portions&quot; with different types of game mechanics, making the game almost a series of mini-games. Swimming and submarining are among your tasks.<br><br>The most predominant type of gameplay, however, consists of side-scrolling arcade action with a realistic basis, so you only have one life and there are no power ups available during missions.",
