  "description": "Just like its <a id=\"d9c1462922379f20ada16d2d94c5e15aa\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Nova\">predecessor</a>, Nova 2 requires the player to guide one or more beams of light to a certain spot. In order to manipulate the beam, different tiles can be placed on the playing filed, these include: tiles that change the direction of the beam by 90 degrees, blocks that cannot be penetrated, blocks that are destroyed by the light and slow it down for a moment, tubes that prevent the beam from being blocked by another beam and &quot;bubbles&quot; that break the light and send it off into two different directions. While the gameplay remains the same, the number of stages has been greatly increased as there are six levels with 32 stages each. A level editor is also included.",
