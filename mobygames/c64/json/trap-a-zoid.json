  "description": "<i>Trap-A-Zoid</i> is an educational game in which the player must capture aliens which wander around on a grid (resembling dotted graph paper) by drawing examples of the specified polygons to enclose them. If the player traps a &quot;Super Zoid&quot;, it will escape their trap and they will be required to answer a geometry question before it reaches the edge of the screen.",
