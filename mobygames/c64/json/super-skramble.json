The objective is to achieve a high score with the three lives that are available.<br>\nOnly one bomb can be on screen at a time and the player's fuel, which runs out rapidly, is replenished by destroying fuel dumps. There are eight different kinds of terrain to negotiate as the game gets progressively harder. <br>\nThe game has a high score feature and can be played either with the keyboard or the joystick. There is no save game feature.",
