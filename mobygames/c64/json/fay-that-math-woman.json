  "description": "The educational program is intended to analyze the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions with answers from 0 to 18 typed in by the player manually. Correct answer gives the player 10 points and wrong answer takes 1 point from the player. Fay is a woman, who should be guided by player's knowledge in arithmetics to the top of a structure, containing 15 stages. Correct answer transfers her to the next question in each of the 4 basic operations levels. Additional two levels are combinations of two and four operations. Highest score is stored to beat it up, and a list of wrong answers can be displayed or printed for the analysis.",
