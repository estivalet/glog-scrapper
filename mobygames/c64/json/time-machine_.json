  "description": "In <i>Time Machine</i>, the player takes control over Professor Potts whose main profession is building time machines. As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each.<br><br>This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.<br><br>The professor has a limited amount of mini time machines in his pocket which can be placed on a screen for travelling purposes. However, the usage of them is not limited. The action elements of the game consist of enemies which try to hurt the professor. Those can be disposed of  by firing an (automatically recharging) electrical discharge. While those action elements are always present, the focus lies on the puzzle solving.",
