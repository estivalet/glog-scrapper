  "description": "The caravan of the brave adventurers heads towards Accardi-By-The-Sea, each of them motivated in his (or her) own way. The magician Frobwit is on his way to the Convention of Enchanters and Sorcerers; the lovely Acia is travelling to visit her sickly grandmother; the merchant Gurthark simply wants to sell goods; and the scout Ryker ponders the new feeling that has entered his life: love...<br><br><i>ZorkQuest: The Crystal of Doom</i> is a direct sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zorkquest-assault-on-egreth-castle\">Assault on Egreth Castle</a>. The gameplay system is identical to that of its predecessor, retaining the player's ability to either follow the narrative from a single character's point of view, or &quot;jump&quot; to a new character. Thus, the player is able to re-read the story and learn new things about how the characters' different paths affected each other, as well as the outcome of the entire story. <br><br>Like in the other <i>InfoComics</i>, the display technology uses a 3D vector format; many scenes are scaled (like zooming on a camera lens), sacrificing detailed graphic textures colors.",
