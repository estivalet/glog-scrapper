  "description": "<i>Fast Break</i> is an action/strategy basketball game for one or two players. You play three on three (guard, center, and forward) on the whole court with 3, 6, 9, or 12 minute quarters. At the start of the game you can customize your team by choosing from a variety of different players, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Included are 14 different plays you can use during the game along with the playmaker which lets you design your own plays. Players can be substituted or the playbook modified by calling timeouts or waiting for the end of a quarter.",
