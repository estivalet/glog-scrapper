  "description": "A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville.<br><br>The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.",
