  "description": "In <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lunar-leeper\">Lunar Leeper</a>, one of Sierra's earlier arcade games, players had to rescue prisoners on a planet's surface while avoiding the &quot;Leepers&quot;, who would leap into the air in an attempt to grab them, and one of the Leepers feature in this game. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=FuzzyWOMP\">Learning with FuzzyWOMP</a>, the player can select one of four games, by moving the Leeper to the icon and pressing the fire button to select it.<br><br>Clockwise from the top, the first game encourages the player to select a series of bones that match the number of dogs on the left side. In the second, the player matches a series of items at the bottom of the screen (including letters, shapes, people, and three-letter words) with the one shown on a platform. In these first two games, the correct answer will flash if a wrong one is given. <br><br>In the third game, players have to make their way through a maze while they are assisted by a caterpillar. The mazes are randomly generated. Finally, the fourth one has players paint a series of pictures ranging from a house and mountains to a human figure.\n",
