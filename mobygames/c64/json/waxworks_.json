But you are tired.  You lie down for a snooze...<br><br>It turns out you are trapped in the Waxworks.  Is it all a dream though?   Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.",
