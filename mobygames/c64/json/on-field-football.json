  "description": "<i>On-Field Football</i> is a game based on the sport of American Football where you can play the computer or another player following the rules closely. Before you play a game you can select how many players or a demo game, how long for a game (5 or 15 mins), and how the players will play a game. The view of the pitch is a 3rd person perspective at a elevated angle with the action behind the offensive team. <br><br>The game kicks off and once the player catching the ball is tackled then decisions need to be made. Using the joystick, you push it up, down, left or right to select a play and this needs to be selected within 30 seconds. Once both teams have selected then you can control either the quarter back if offensive or a defender if defensive. Once the quarterback has passed it the player with the ball is under your control. You are also able to punt the ball or kick the ball for the extra point or a field goal.",
