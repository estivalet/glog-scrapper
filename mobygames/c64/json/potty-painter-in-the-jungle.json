  "description": "<i>Potty Painter In The Jungle</i> is a single player action game with puzzle elements.<br><br>Bizarrely, considering the name of the game, the player takes the role of a gorilla. The gorilla is being hunted and must elude his captors. If successful they then do battle with the fearsome 'Teddy Twins'.<br><br>The game takes place on a grid with irregularly sized rectangles. Each rectangle has a score associated with it. By going around all four sides of the shape the player gets the score it contains. The objective here is to score on all squares.<br>\nHaving survived this phase of the game the player then progresses to the second part of the game where they must guide a teddy bear towards a banana.<br>\nThe third and final part of the game is similar to the first part but here the player takes the role, not of a gorilla but of a paint roller and the hunters are teddy bears.",
