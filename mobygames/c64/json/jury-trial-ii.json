  "description": "<i>Jury Trial II</i> is a text-based 2 - 6 player court room simulation for multiple systems.<br><br>Requiring at least 2 players, one player (or group of players) takes charge of the prosecution team, while the other group takes charge of the defense.  At the beginning of each case, both teams receive basic information about the case, and then have to quiz the local sheriff on further information regarding the events of the crime, the suspect, and any witnesses.  Each team can only ask a limited number of questions before the sheriff grows bored, and shuns the lawyers out of his office.  <br><br>In the next section of game play, both sides are presented a number of potential jurors, and the two players need to decide which jurors are most appropriate to try their case.  Only jurors whom are agreed upon by both the defense and prosecution are eligible, and different characters will have different likelihood of finding the client guilty or innocent.<br><br>In the next section, players progress to the actual trial.  Here, players take turns calling witnesses to the the stand.  One player plays the role of the lawyer, while the other player takes the role of the witness.  The lawyers choose from a number of questions to ask.  If the witness correctly answers the question, it pushes the jury away from the lawyer's argument, and if the witness is unable to answer a question, it pushes the jurors towards the lawyer's argument.  If the prosecution is doing badly, they can take a chance to speak with the sheriff again.<br><br>Finally, at the end of the trial the jury gives a verdict, and the accused will either go free or end up behind bars.",
