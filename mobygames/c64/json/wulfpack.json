  "description": "<i>Wulfpack</i> is a single player naval warfare screen set in World War II.<br><br>The game is played over three phases. The player commands a destroyer and in the first phase they must patrol the Atlantic protecting convoys from submarine attack. This phase of the game continues until sufficient supplies have arrived in England for the invasion to begin. If too many ships are lost then the game ends.\nOnce the destroyer runs out of depth charges it must return to port and it is the captain's / player's task to successfully dock the ship. There are twelve ships in the fleet and crashing into the harbour causes the ship to sink. If all ships are lost then the game is over.<br><br>Once sufficient supplies have reached England the second phase commences in which the destroyer assists in the D-Day invasion by bombarding the enemy defences while avoiding mines and friendly ships.<br><br>In the final phase, after shelling the defences the player must guide landing craft to the beaches. If sufficient craft land then the enemy surrender, if not the invasion fails.<br><br>The game can be controlled via the keyboard or the joystick and it has five levels of difficulty.<br><br>",
