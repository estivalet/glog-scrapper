  "description": "Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is an early text adventure based on the bestselling book, released years before Douglas Adams's better-known text adventure with Infocom. In it, you have to explore a quaint English village and even other planets to recover five artifacts from the books and return them to a key location. Commands are entered using a very basic two-word parser with minimal help or flavor text in the game. ",
