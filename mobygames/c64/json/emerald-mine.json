  "description": "A conversion of the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> game. The player is deep down in a cave and has to collect emeralds and diamonds while evading monsters - and the laws of gravity, which have the annoying habit of squishing him with huge rocks if he happens to stand beneath one as it falls down.<br><br>The game also has a two-player mode where two people can rid caves of their valuables at the same time - in addition to the 80 levels, there are 20 exclusive two-player levels.",
