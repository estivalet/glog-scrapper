  "description": "<i>Werner: Let's go!</i> is based on the German comics character Werner and offers five mini games:\n<ul><li>Meiern (also known as mia) is a dice game with an emphasis on bluffing. The basic rules: A player makes a hidden dice throw and checks the result. Then he gives the dice cup to the next player and says his result which may be true or a bluff (the said result needs to be higher than what the player before said). The next player either has the choice to throw the dice or to call a bluff. In the latter variant he opens up the dice cup and either the bluffer or the wrongful accuser gets a minus point.</li>\n<li>A side-scrolling car drive in which the player has to avoid obstacles by accelerating or ducking.</li>\n<li>Another car drive which is essentially the same with items which have to be picked up and used at the right time.</li>\n<li>The fourth game is about building a motorcycle. The player needs to choose between a variety of parts. This game is lost after twelve incorrect guesses.</li>\n<li>A motorcycle drive where the camera is directly placed behind the motorcycle. The goal is to avoid obstacles.</li></ul>",
