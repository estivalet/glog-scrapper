  "description": "You have 24 levels to roll through within the time limit. Each level is composed of an assortment of squares with different functions - red slows you down and green speeds you up, black holes must be avoided, cyan squares temporarily reverse your controls, and blue squares trigger a jump. Aliens can be shot, but every other hazard must be avoided, as contact with them or falling into holes costs valuable time.<br><br>Time left at the end of each level is added to the score. Hit the white blobs on the screen to earn credits, which can be used to purchase power-ups or tricks, which last only for the next level. Options include slowing down time, closing all black holes, deactivating the purple squares, and a shield.",
