  "description": "<i>Crime and Punishment</i> is a courtroom simulation, where you play the judge. The emphasis lies on deciding the punishment, rather than if the person is guilty or not - that has already been decided. The aim is to receive as many Gavels as possible (out of ten), by choosing the same sentence as a judge.<br><br>Cases range from perjury and theft right up to murder and rape. To help you make your decision, you can receive information about the crime. This includes the damage caused by the crime, the villain's background and personal circumstances, and his/her motive.<br><br>Be aware that the more information you ask for, the less gavels you receive. The AI can sometimes produce surprising choices of sentences.",
