  "description": "Hope to Hopp is a small platformer, a mini-game made in just 2048 Bytes that won a &quot;2KByter&quot;-competition arranged by German &quot;64'er&quot; magazine in 1993.<br><br>The player has to get that little guy called Benny safely through 19 levels. Apart from water holes and tricky placed platforms there are also flying cannonballs that don't make his way easier. Benny can run left and right and he can jump, but as he has no weapons or power-ups, he is better off avoiding the cannonballs at all costs. When he gets hit or misses the platforms the game is over and the player has to start again from the beginning.<br><br>The game is a one-direction side-scroller that scrolls forward by itself at a steady rate so the player has to be on his toes to make the jumps in time. With the levels getting longer and the platform placement getting trickier, the degree of difficulty increases. However, when the white clouds in the sky change their colour to cyan the level ending is near. Benny can then run to the right to exit the level and proceed to the next.",
