  "description": "<i>Dr. Pimple's Dog</i> is a single screen game viewed from above and after a name mix-up (you're a nine stone weakling), you have been summoned by King Notlob to rescue his 16 daughters, kidnapped by Dr. Pimple (another nine stone weakling). Over nine levels, Dr. Pimple has placed the Princesses in mine fields, with the mines hidden, and you have to get from the bottom of the screen to the top without being blown up. As you move up the screen, you leave a trail of red paint to show the path you have taken and when you are one place from a mine or mines you are told how many but not the locations. The fence surrounding the mine field is deadly and cannot be touched and also registers as a mine. <br><br>After you escape level one, the Princesses start to appear and they also register as a mine but you have the choice to leave them alone and just get yourself to safety. Level three onwards has the Doctor's dog following the trail of paint you leave behind and licks it, but do not let him catch you up as he has a bomb round his neck. A minah bird also makes an appearance dropping extra mines and on level nine you encounter Dr. Pimple who has to be caught. You only have one life and it is game over when you die but you start on the previous level when you start again.",
