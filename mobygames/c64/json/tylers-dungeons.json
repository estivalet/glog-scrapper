  "description": "<i>Tyler's Dungeons</i> is a maze game that consists of 250 rooms on four levels that are connected with elevators. The player character (which mostly resembles a walking squid) has to locate and collect eight pieces of treasure. Upon its release players who succeeded were eligible for a random drawing with a chance of winning 500 dollars.<br><br>There are three obstacles that the player has to watch out for: lurks, cross traps and snakepits. The lurks are ever present with one in every room of the dungeon. When moving from one room to another the lurk in the new room appears at the same position as the one in the previous room. The cross traps are rooms that will collapse on the player with him ending up trapped in a small space with nowhere to go. When in a snakepit the player has to watch out for snakes that suddenly appear from the ground. They then quickly move in a straight line through the corridor towards the player who has to step into an adjacent corridor to avoid it. The player dies instantly upon making contact with the baddies or being trapped and then has to restart from the beginning.",
