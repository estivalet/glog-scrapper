  "description": "Based on the same &quot;engine&quot; as <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gazzas-super-soccer\">Gazza's</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gazzas-super-soccer\">Bodo Illgner's Super Soccer</a></i> games, <i>Anders Limpar's proffs fotboll</i> brandishes the name of the Swedish Serie A and Premier League player Anders Limpar.<br><br>The game features the top teams of Sweden (as of 1989), as well as a surprise visit from Denmark. In single player mode, you can run a cup or a league, consisting of between 4 and 20 teams, playing games of 1 to 45 minutes. Playing style and kicks can be changed, and all members of the roster can be given names, and team names can be changed. The players gain experience from each match and teams may be saved and loaded to tape. Exhibition games can be played both against the computer or another player.<br><br>When playing, the view switches from a side view of the field to a vertical one when the ball comes closer to either goal.",
