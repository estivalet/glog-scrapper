Its training,  and transition to Thurleigh, England, and twenty five missions that a pilot might have flown at that time.<br><br>  You'll start of as a second lieutenant with only a few hours of flight experience. You must choose your crew, and then learn to fly in a series of training flying missions. You'll then also learn how to take off with your plane and then form in a formation group. After learning the basics, you'll go out on practice bombing runs. Earning the highest efficient ratings will get you the best scores during the game. The first missions will start in the USA. When your are finished with the training missions, you'll fly to England to take part in the war effort.<br><br>  Now your 25 mission tour of duty will begin, where you take part in bombing raids over Germany. Make sure you make a copy of you game disk before beginning to play. You'll have to drop bombs and then make your way back home. Sometimes damage will occur during these missions. Aptitude, Stamina, Copilot, Bombardier, Navigator, Engineer, Radio Operator and Gunner Positions all have an effect how your missions succeed. Each mission that you undertake will have a briefing screen describing the mission and objectives, similar to the screens in the training session. During you missions, there are thirteen possible types of damage that your aircraft can sustain.<br><br>  After each mission is completed, you will earn efficiency points. You will gain points for amount of enemy craft shot down, completing the mission and successful formations during the mission. You will also loose efficiency points for crashing, using a secondary airfield, ditching, bailing out and if you fall out of formation.",
