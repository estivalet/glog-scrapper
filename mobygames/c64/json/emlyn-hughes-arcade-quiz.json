  "description": "<i>Emlyn Hughes' Arcade Quiz</i> is a game based on quiz machines found in bars and public houses. The idea is to move through ten mazes of blocks and reach the Win bar on the right of the screen. Be careful though, as the maze scrolls to the left and if your not quick enough you will reach the Lose bar on the left of the screen. <br><br>You will encounter different types of blocks that will help or hinder you. These include Question blocks, get it right and you can move on, get it wrong and you have to answer another question meaning you slowly scroll towards the left of the screen. Money can also be collected to help stack up your total at the end of the level. Other blocks include a block that will block you for a certain time and a block that moves you in a random direction. <br><br>When you reach the Win bar you enter a bonus game where on a time limit you have to answer as a number of questions based on how many coins you collected. Afterwards you have a choice to either cash in your money or move onto the next level which will cost you money to enter. Along with the main playing area, you can also see how much money you have and any bonuses collected.",
