  "description": "A text adventure game. It is year 1997. Hong Kong has moved from British administration to the Chinese, but not without bloodshed. Worse, a rich gold mine has been discovered right under the city. In the middle of a new international crisis, a single agent - the player, naturally - is sent to destroy the city with a nuclear bomb, but he is captured. Your task is to escape from the prison camp and continue your mission.<br><br>The game features a simple verb-noun text parser with support for noun inflection (which was critical because the game was in Finnish).",
