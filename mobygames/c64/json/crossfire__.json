  "description": "<i>Crossfire</i> is a single screen 1st person perspective shooter where you are a policeman leading 'The Untouchables' against the mob lead by Al Capone and 'Legs' Diamond. You must visit nine locations and shoot all the bad guys that appear on the screen in various places, by controlling a cross-hair and shooting them. Civilian's also appear and these cannot be shot or you lose points at the end of each location. To complete a location you must stay alive while a timer counts down, and when it reaches zero then you move to the next location. As you shoot, the bad guys will shoot back after a short time and if you are hit then you lose one of four lives and the location starts again.",
