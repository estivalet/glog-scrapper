You get to the bridge and see a blue button flashing. Pushing the button, you hear a communique from your superior. You are to locate the Megaship Armstrong, missing and out of communication for ten years, and determine why she has stopped responding and never reached the colony she was destined for. You are then to report back what you find. Good luck.",
