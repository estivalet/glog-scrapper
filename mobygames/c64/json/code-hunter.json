  "description": "Earth is in trouble as an Alien Battleship moves towards the planet for invasion. The only solution is to send a <i>Code Hunter</i> Intruder Droid into the ship's computer network and place bombs to remove the guards. Once the guards are removed on one of 16 levels then a code is sent back to Earth and once the full code is received then the Battleship can be disarmed, then destroyed.  <br><br>The game is a platform game with the whole level shown on the screen. Each level is made of four rows with various amounts of platforms on each row and your droid has to move about the platforms placing a bomb. The droid can only place one bomb at a time in hopefully the path of a moving guard but can change the placing at any time. Once a guard has touched a bomb then it starts shaking and you have to wait for it to stop shaking before you can touch it and thus removing it. Once all guards are removed then it's onto the next level.<br><br>All the guards have to be removed before a decreasing energy bar reaches zero and if it does or you touch a guard then you lose one of three lives and the level has to be restarted. The main platforms allow you to move left, right, up and down but some platforms have various icons on them which sends you the direction it is pointing, increase or decrease your energy, send you back to the start platform or transport you to another transport platform.
