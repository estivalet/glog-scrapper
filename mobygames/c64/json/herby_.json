  "description": "In <i>Herby</i> the titular character needs to be guided through a maze that consists of more than 100 single-screen rooms, connected horizontally and vertically, to find the exit. He starts with five lives and needs to avoid hazards and enemies, while solving a number of puzzles. He can be moved around freely in eight directions using a joystick. The screen shows the total score, remaining number of lives, the room number, the percentage of the game that has been solved, and the amount of keys he carries.<br><br>Typical hazards are barriers that disappear briefly, moving enemies and moving blocks. A single collision is immediately deadly. Puzzles involve keys to open doors and items that need to be picked up. Some items have an effect right away, while others only reveal their purpose later on.",
