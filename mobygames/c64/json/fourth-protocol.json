  "description": "This interactive fiction computer game is based on the bestselling Cold War spy novel by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,295773/\">Frederick Forsyth</a> released in 1984 by Hutchinson publishing.  As the novel's hero John Preston, you have been appointed head of the C1(A), an agency of the British Secret Intelligence Service. You uncover a plot, named AURORA, to take power in the Soviet Union hatched by a secret faction of high-level minds.  In order to stop their plan you read a lot of info found in Top Secret folders, set wiretaps, monitor and interrogate suspects and informants, and gather facts and clues.  <br><br>The game has three main sections - The NATO Documents, The Bomb and The SAS Assault. A secret code must be gained in order to proceed from one to the next. Unique icon-based graphics provide the means to conduct your investigation though they're not mouse-clickable (you have to browse the icons using the space bar).  Plot twists and developments happen during the game and are communicated to you with text-only descriptions.",
