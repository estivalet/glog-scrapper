  "description": "Count Chameleon recognises the importance of the game of cricket to the power of the British Empire, and knows that a simple Rubbertronic Ray to scupper the ball's bounce is all it takes to bring their power down. You control the team of Viscount Stifflip, Professor Braindeath, Colonel R G Bargie and Miss Primbottom, as they attempt to stop him.<br><br>The bulk of the game is icon-driven, and allows you to switch between the four characters at will. The control options are all described in slangy English terms, so instead of talking to characters you 'Chinwag' with them, and fights are called 'Fisticuffs'. These are a key aspect of the game, requiring prompt arcade reactions and correct move selection, especially as using the low blow too often results in a character being wiped out.",
