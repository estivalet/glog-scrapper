  "description": "In this tennis game, the focus is on timing and directing your shots accurately, as the computer moves your player into position. The positive result of this is that you can (and to win must) play angled volleys and precisely-placed lob and drop shots. The gameplay is thus more tactical than many tennis games; choosing the move to outfox your opponent comes into play.<br><br>1 or 2 player, 3 or 5 set matches can be played, or asphalt, clay or grass. The four computer players are inspired by Jimmy Conners, Björn Borg, John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl. Court layout and service rules are accurate. The AI player watches your playing style and can step up a gear in quality if it needs to.",
