  "description": "There is a looking glass which when looked through stops anything looking beautiful and makes anything ugly worse. The looking glass has smashed into pieces and scattered around the surrounding areas making it a ugly place to be.<br><br>Based loosely on a fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson, <i>The Snow Queen</i> is a text adventure where you play the role of an adviser to Gerda who must find and rescue her friend Kay who has been struck by one of the pieces and has been spirited away to the Snow Queen. In an innovative twist to the traditional adventure game set up instead of playing the protagonist you act as an advisor to them, and Gerda can choose not to carry out your commands.  This means that you have to try to think in character when solving the problems presented to you in the game.  Both versions have text which describes your location and you type in commands to control your hero and interact with each location. The Commodore 64 version has graphics to let you see your location.",
