  "description": "Probably the first retro-collection ever foisted upon the buying public.  A collection of four classic computer games (well, three computer games and an adaptation of an electronic video game.)  Play <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Eliza\">Eliza</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Conway%27s+Game+of+Life\">Conway's Life</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,15632/\">Crowther</a>'s <a id=\"d345ba26e6b141c800f1d121694efffc7\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Mainframe\">Adventure</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Al+Acorn\">Al Alcorn</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pong\">Pong</a>.<br><br>All four games are liberal adaptations - there is no standard <i>Eliza</i>, and this version seems to lack compared to others. <i>Pong</i> is an ASCII rendition of the game (and includes a remake with color!). <i>Life</i>, however, includes various pre-formed populations, including the infamous glider-gun that figures prominently in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,15639/\">Steven Levy</a>'s book <i>Hackers</i>.",
