  "description": "Dr. Xavier Tortion (aka Dr. X), jewel thief and smuggler extraordinaire, is on the loose; intelligence reports he is somewhere in North America along with numerous jewels he's stolen. Your job will be to find the jewels and locate Dr. X! <br><br><i>Adventures in North America</i> is an educational adventure game which is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Carmen+Sandiego+Series\">Carmen Sandiego</a> series of games. In the game you will need to travel to various North American locations to search for clues; some clues have been left behind by friendly agents and indicate where jewels are located. Sometimes you will come across an informant; if bribed with money or jewels, you will receive a clue as to Dr. X's where about. When you think you have enough clues, you can guess where Dr. X is hiding; you only get three guesses though, so if you keep guessing wrong the game will end. If you are successful in your mission, you are given an efficiency rating; the fewer turns you can locate Dr. X in and the more jewels recovered, the better your score will be. ",
