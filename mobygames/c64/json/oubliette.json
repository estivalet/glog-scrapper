  "description": "<i>Oubliette</i> is one of the earliest party-based role-playing games. It is an open-ended hack-and-slash through a multilevel dungeon with a party of 1-6 characters, chosen from possible classes including Fighters, Priests and Thieves. They will gain experience, jewelry and armor as the adventure progresses, but they will also age and may eventually die. Spells are triggered through typing their activation codes.  The party can be changed before every trip to the dungeon by dropping off / picking up characters from the local tavern.  ",
