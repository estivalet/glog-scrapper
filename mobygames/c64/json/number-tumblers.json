  "description": "<i>Number Tumblers</i> is an educational game teaching mathematics. The game is played on a network of tumblers, cubes with either numbers or signs on them, where the player controls a creature called Wumblechum who has to jump between the tumblers to reach target numbers. After jumping on a + sign each number cube that gets jumped on is added and in the same way numbers are subtracted after jumping on a - sign. There are also multiplication and division signs. There are five target numbers and once one has been reached the counter is reset and the player starts working towards another one.<br><br>The game can be played by one or two players. In the single player mode it's possible to play alone in a solitaire mode or against an AI opponent in a computer challenge. The two player mode can be played either simultaneously or by alternating.",
