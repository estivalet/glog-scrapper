  "description": "In <i>Street Gang</i> the player takes the role of Mickey who just moved from the country to New York. Now he wants to become one of the big boys and join the street gang. But they set him a challenge: cutting off a curl of hair from their leader...<br><br>So in conclusion Mickey walks from left to right while defending himself again the enemy hordes. The game plays out as a standard brawler in which Mickey uses hand-to-hand combat against the foes. However, when he gets the hand of them he also can use other items like guns, baseball bats or teargas. Being hit by opponents, which sometimes hide in garbage bins, drain Mickey's energy and eventually one of his lives.",
