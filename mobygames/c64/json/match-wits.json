  "description": "<i>Match Wits</i> is a memory/concentration game mixed with elements from quiz and word guessing games. The game is for two players who take turns turning over squares to reveal the hidden words. The aim is to pick pairs of matching words which are then removed from the board. As squares are removed a hidden picture puzzle begins to be revealed and the players get chances to guess on its meaning. The player that enters the correct answer will win the round. A game consists of three rounds and the player with the highest score wins. There are six different subject categories to choose from: animals, cities, multiplication, words, sports and famous people. The game also comes with a secretary program that allows the player to edit and add content to the game.",
