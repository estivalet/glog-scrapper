  "description": "TLL sets you as a skilled pilot who must take on a tough mission - shooting out six discs representing enemy strongholds in built-up areas. This must be done by lowering your altitude as you approach each one, making it crucial to avoid trees and buildings which are closer to ground level.<br><br>The action is viewed from above using a pseudo-3D display, and scrolls vertically in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=SWIV\">SWIV</a>. At the side of the screen your altitude and fuel level are displayed, as well as an all-important mini-map. You will frequently have to refuel, which is done by touching down on the carrier. You don't have direct control over the plane's speed, a fact which takes the game out of the realm of simulation somewhat.",
