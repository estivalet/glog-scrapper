  "description": "<i>Spot</i> is an unofficial implementation of the board game <moby game=\"Connect Four variants\">Connect Four</i>. Players take turn placing tokens on a 7 by 6 grid in an attempt to get four in a row, but unlike <i>Tic-Tac-Toe</i> tokens may only be placed at the bottom-most available spot in any column. The game continues until someone has four in a row (horizontal, diagonal or vertical), or the entire grid is filled. This version of the game only features two player mode, there is no AI to play against.",
