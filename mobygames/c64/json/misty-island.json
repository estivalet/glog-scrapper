  "description": "You have been dumped on Misty Island, in a semi-conscious state by spies for knowing too much, and left too die with no food. As the spies leave, they whisper something about 'hiding the evidence', but your main problem is surviving. You have to try to escape the island back to civilisation, but first you need to find equipment to be able to get food to stop you starving to death, while surviving the island looking for the evidence. <i>Misty Island</i> is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.",
