  "description": "<i>Street Beat</i> is an adventure in the land of good groove. You basically  have a ghettoblaster, and you go around the streets of London and you get them to dance to the music. Once you have made the required amount dancing, you take the tape into a record company. Watch out for the policemen, the tone deaf walker, the gangster of groove and the psycho killer because they can make you start over, or kill you. This game is inspired by an unknown rasta and his ghettoblaster at Battersea Park in London, England.",
