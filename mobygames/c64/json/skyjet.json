  "description": "You are the pilot of a helicopter and your mission is to explore five levels to find parts to help build a supply base on each level. The game is viewed from the side as the screen scrolls in both directions horizontally when you move your helicopter. A part for the base is marked ET and you have to pick it up and fly it to the site of the base. Once placed you have to keep finding them until the base is built. Trying to stop you are various vehicles that try to bomb and shoot at you but you have a gun to shoot them back. Touch an enemy, get shot or bombed, or land too quickly on the ground and you lose one of five lives. Lose them all and it's game over and the joystick is used to control the helicopter.",
