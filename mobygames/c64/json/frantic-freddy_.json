  "description": "Not to be confused with the quite famous <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/frantic-freddie\">Frantic Freddie</a></i>, this is an unofficial C64 port of the lesser-known Spectravideo game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/spectravideo/frantic-freddy\">Frantic Freddy</a></i>.<br><br>Freddy must put all the fires and rescue all the trapped cats from building on fire. Freddy must run back and forth on the ground, dodging falling rubbish while shooting water at flames in the windows of a building. When all fires are extinguished, the game progresses to the next floor, where Freddy can climb between the floors, shooting to the left and right instead of upwards. On these levels, there are two kinds of flames – the red and the purple ones. The purple ones are more aggressive, following Freddy around the screen, and can only be put out once all the red ones are extinguished. <br><br>On the higher difficulty levels, cats turn up at intervals in the windows, falling down after a while. Freddy must catch the cats, or he will lose a life. Similarly, he loses a life if hit by a fire or falling rubbish.",
