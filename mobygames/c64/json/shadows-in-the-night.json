  "description": "The owner of a large mansion outside the village has died and left it in his will to various owners. The owners visited their inheritance to check it out but on entering the mansion, strange noises are heard as well as a piano playing. With no response to calling out and seeing no one playing the piano, the chimes of the Grandfather clock is the last straw and the new owners leave in a hurry vowing never to return. Andy, one of the new owners is enjoying a drink with you in the local pub, The Fox and Hounds, and the conversation turns to the haunted mansion full of Shadows of the Night. After listening to his story, you accept his dare to spend the night in the mansion for eight hours trying to discover clues to what causes the Shadows of the Night. <i>Shadows in the Night</i> is a text adventure with the screen having text describing your location with various sound effects to give the game atmosphere. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings and there is also on screen a clock counting down.",
