  "description": "Viewed from above, the task in Tilt is to rotate the screen so as to guide a ball across a maze into a hole. Unfortunately, if the ball hits any of the walls en route you have to start again, which means that the energy used on the previous tilts is wasted (and you only have a limited amount). There are a number of gates on each screen, which you must open by pressing the fire button at the right moments. As the game progresses the ball gradually gets bigger, giving you less margin for error on maneuvering it. There are also traps to avoid - these are active if the maze isn't tilting, so you'll have to keep it moving.",
