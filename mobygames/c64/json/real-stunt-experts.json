  "description": "You take the role of stuntman Fred MacMuscle who has been down on his luck but is offered to handle the stunts for a new series - Ricky Steel, Secret Agent. The caveat is that you are expected to cover your own insurance for each of the dangerous stunts.<br><br>Completing each stunt scene will give you a certain amount of money that allows you to pay for the insurance for each stunt. The stunts vary from driving a car along a track, using ramps to jump over obstacles while shooting or avoiding others to flying a helicopter to rescue prisoners of war and rescue hostages from a burning building.",
