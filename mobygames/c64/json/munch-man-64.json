While you eat the dots you are chased by four ghosts and if you touch a ghost then you lose one of three lives. There are four large dots in each corner and when eaten allow you to chase and eat the ghosts for a short period of time. Occasionally a fruit will appear and when eaten give you bonus points and a level is completed once all the dots are eaten and you then play the same maze full of dots again. Two players can play and each player takes it in turn to play when the other player loses a life.",
