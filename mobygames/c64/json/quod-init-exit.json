  "description": "<i>Quod Init Exit</i> (which is latin and roughly translates to &quot;what goes in must come out&quot;) is a simple one screen platform game starring a hungry pig. The player controls the pig who runs and leaps across the platforms and has to try to catch the various kinds of food that scrolls across the screen. If the pig doesn't eat enough he will starve to death. Everything that zips past him is not edible however. Poison bottle has to be avoided or the pig will meet an early death. When the pig's hunger meter is full a toilet will scroll through the screen. To complete the level he has to get to it and ride it off the screen. Failing to do so will leave the pig's excrements on the screen and the game is over. ",
