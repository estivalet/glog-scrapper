  "description": "The blessed island of Ymros is always at ease thanks to the Shard Of Spring -- a crystal that bestows eternal springtime. Now, the evil sorceress Siriadne has stolen the sacred shard and you have to get it back. The world you once knew has fallen to hunger, famine and despair. Everyone now asks you to come forward and take the challenge!<br><br><i>Shard of Spring</i> is a role-playing game, in which the player creates and builds up a party of adventurers composed of the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, trolls, and gnomes. The two main classes are warrior and wizard; each class specializes in different skills (such as elemental proficiencies). Towns are represented by simple text menus; most of the action takes place in the dungeons, fighting enemy parties in turn-based combat.",
