  "description": "A beautiful princess has been turned into an ugly monster by an evil Wizard and to make matters worse she has been made to dance forever in this single screen 1st person perspective game. You have vowed to help her by removing her hideous body parts, piece by piece as she dances around the screen. On the top left of the screen it tells you the next body part to remove and so you move a cross-hair and try to shoot it with a magic ray. A clock counts upwards and you have to remove all parts before it reaches a certain time. There is also a gauge that decreases and if you don't fire before it empties then it is game over. If you shoot your ray too many times without hitting the correct part then a new part reappears again. ",
