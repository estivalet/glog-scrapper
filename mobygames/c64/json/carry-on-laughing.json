  "description": "<i>Carry on Laughing</i> is a single screen platform game where you play the role of Mr Livewire whose job is to tidy up all the classrooms at St. Hexidecimals, a school for demented programmers. The school is made up of various screens and you must tidy up each screen by turning all the large X's into ticks while avoiding the various people, creatures and objects that move around the screen. At the bottom of the screen is a bar with Mr Livewire walking from left to right across with X's on it, and a screen is completed when all the X's are ticks and Mr Livewire reaches the right of the bar. On the walls surrounding each classroom are an arrow and you can select which classroom to go to next with a small grid on the bottom left showing where you have visited. As well as platforms to walk on there are various ways to move up to higher levels like ladders, bars and on one screen you can use bubbles to float upwards. If you are touched by the people, creatures or objects then you lose one of three lives and all the ticks have turned into X's. Two players can play with each player taking it in turns when the other player loses a life.",
