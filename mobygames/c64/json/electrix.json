  "description": "<i>Electrix</i> is a flick-screen platformer where you are an electrician tasked to fix the underground cables of a Powerstation in Los Angeles, sabotaged by vandals over 20 levels against the clock. Each level is made up of various screens with three rows underground and a row above ground connected by ladders and on the rows underground are broken wires that have to be run over to fix. As you fix the ten wires needed to complete a level, there are various creatures that move across each screen and these have to be avoided or you lose one of three lives. Various electrical equipment can be collected as well for bonus points.",
