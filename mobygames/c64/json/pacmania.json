  "description": "Not to be confused with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pac-mania\">Pac-Mania</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/namco-limited\">Namco</a>, this is a  <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/pac-man\">Pac-Man</a> clone where the object is to eat dots and power pills. Several ghosts appear in their hideout at the center of the maze, and these ghosts will eventually make their way through the maze, chasing Pac-Man wherever he goes. However, eating the power pills cause the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to hunt a ghost down and then eat it for bonus points, which are also awarded for eating a fruit that appears somewhere within the maze. Warp tunnels are located at either side of the screen, and these can be used to get away from ghosts that are on Pac-Man's tail.<br><br>Besides power pills, also scattered around the maze are white H icons. If Pac-Man comes in contact with any of these icons, he will be teleported to anywhere in the maze. Once Pac-Man eats all the dots and power pills in the maze, he will advance to the next one, whose structure differs from the previous.<br><br>",
