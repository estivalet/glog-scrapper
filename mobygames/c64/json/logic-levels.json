The player controls a hand icon which can place a variety of tools within the maze, including bridges, vertical walls that prevent ball movement, and springers that push the ball up a level,.  Spray pain cans can  change the color of the ball to pick up prizes of the same color.  The player can controls when to activate these items as the ball rolls.  As the ball rolls, it loses energy, and the player must reach the end with energy intact.  Energy can be obtained by changing to the correct color and moving over energy squares.  There are holes in the maze, and if the ball rolls off the side, the level is lost.  Levels become progressively more difficult.  ",
