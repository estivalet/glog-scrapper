  "description": "King George's daughter Priscilla has been kidnapped by an evil wizard named Harlin, who holds her in his castle. The King offers half of his kingdom to anyone who would venture into the faraway mountain land, enter the castle, defeat Harlin, and bring back the princess. Only one adventurer is brave enough to accept this challenge.<br><br><i>The Wizard and the Princess</i> is a text adventure with graphics. The game's environments are composed of still shots viewed from first-person perspective. The player types combinations of verbs and objects to interact with the game world, move between locations, solve puzzles, and advance the story.<br><br>The IBM PC version, entitled <i>Adventure in Serenia</i>, is the exact same game, with the exception of the plot introduction, which is described as a sequel to <i>The Wizard and the Princess</i>: Harlin uses the sands of time to undo his demise by the brave wanderer, and the player has to defeat him once again.",
