  "description": "As with IK+, the main addition of this Way of the Exploding Fist follow-up is a third player during the bouts - unlike IK+ all 3 can be human-controlled. A similar range of moves is offered to the predecessor, including attacking and defensive moves, and the moves vary in their value in terms of the points they offer within the fight, and the points they add to your score.<br><br>You start off as a rookie; to reach the first of the 10 Dans you must win 2 bouts before either of your opponents. Each bout is won by scoring 6 points, or by having the top score after 60 seconds. Finish last in any bout and you are out.<br><br>After every two rounds, a bonus game is played, which sets you in a darkened alleyway shooting at a succession of ninja heads, scoring points for each until you miss one.",
