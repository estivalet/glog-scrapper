  "description": "There is a battle taking place on the planet of Cybor between two giant robots representing two races from the planet. Your race's robot has been infiltrated by your enemy to make it weaker so the other robot can destroy it. Taking control of a worker-droid called <i>Cosmonut</i> you have infiltrated your robot's head and you must find any enemy wandering around and destroy them. There are also various rooms that need sealing by completing various arcade games. Once you have sealed the rooms then you can enter the Central Control Room and make your robot stronger to finish off the other robot. All this has to be done before your robot loses all it's power.<br><br>The main element of the game is a top down view maze game with the screen scrolling as you move. You are armed with a laser which has limited power to shoot the other creatures or you can avoid them as touching one lose one of three lives. Scattered around the maze are doorways to rooms and there contain the arcade games that need completing. The games include a shooting game where you have to shoot your enemy while avoiding being touched, avoid being hit by meteors or bombs, and finally take control of your robot and shoot the other robot. All these games are viewed from the side.<br><br>Once you complete the maze then it's on to the second maze to once again shoot the enemy and seal rooms. Once both mazes have been completed you can then strengthen your robot before participating in the final battle and save your race.",
