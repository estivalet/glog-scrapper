  "description": "Included with this game is an illustrated storybook with Paddington Bear, first created in books by Michael Bond, that serves as a preamble to the mini-games. <br><br>Paddington receives a present of a bedside clock from Jonathan and Judy, with glow-in-the-dark hands that can be seen in the dark.  <br><br>But the clock doesn't have numbers, only lines which must be deciphered. There are several mini-games which help children on how to tell time and read clocks: Wayup, Figures, Digital, Clock, and Stopwatch.",
