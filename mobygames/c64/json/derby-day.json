  "description": "<i>Derby Day</i> allows yourself and three other players to bet money on the outcome of seven horse races in one meeting from a bookie called Jolly Jack. Before the races begin you can select the type of odds you want to receive, Fun (up to 15/1), Serious (up to 7/1) and Dead Serious (99/1 to 1/99). You can also select whether to bet in Pounds or Pence, with Pence allowing you to have a player as the bookie in real life taking actual money off the other players. After your selections you are now presented with four horses in the first race with their name and odds. Starting with £100 each, each player bets on one horse with an amount of money, and if a player bets on the wrong horse they can change their bet.<br><br>The race itself is viewed from the side at an elevated angle with the screen scrolling left to right, and when the race is over then a photo finish is shown with the race result. The horse that wins pays out the full odds while 2nd place pays a quarter of the odds. The money is totaled up and the next races horses appear for the next round of bets but it is game over for any player with no money left.",
