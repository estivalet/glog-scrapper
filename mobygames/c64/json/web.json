  "description": "You are a troubleshooter for Global Weapons Inc and you have been sent to a plant with generator problems. When you arrive you realise that the situation is worse and that the plant is in meltdown with all 30 of its generators malfunctioning and all the automated devices running amok. The generators need switching off but the plant is too dangerous to enter so you have to send in your Remote Energy Manipulator or Sleepy as you like to call it, and find and shut down all the generators before the plant is destroyed and the surrounding areas.<br><br>The game is a maze game viewed from the side with the screen scrolling in multiple directions when Sleepy moves. For Sleepy to move he shoots out a web strand and when it connects to an object, Sleepy can move along it with the ability to shoot a web strand at any time at 90, 180, 270 or 360 degree angles. Once a generator is found then a web strand shot into the top will shut it off. Sleepy only has a limited amount of web and the amount decreases in size depending on the length of the web.<br><br>As Sleepy explores the plant there are many devices roaming the plant and obstacles that need avoiding like electrified gates that turn on and off. Sleepy can fire bullets at the devices to destroy them but if Sleepy touches a device, obstacle or wall then its arachnipower decreases. If its power or web strands reach zero then it is game over but these can be reset back to full every time a generator is shut down.",
