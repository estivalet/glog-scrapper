  "description": "<i>Knights of the Desert</i> is the operational level simulation of Rommel's famous North African Campaign of WWII. The game begins in March 1941 and ends in February 1943 in 12 turns each representing 2 months. Both players goals are the same. That is to sweep across the northern coast of Africa pushing the enemy as far back as possible capturing key towns such as Benghazi and Tobruk along the way. The only difference is the direction you are heading. As the German Commander your main goal is east to Alexandria. As the British Commander your main goal is to sweep Rommel all the way back to El Agheila and win the game. Knights of the Desert provides for solitaire play where the computer directs the British.",
