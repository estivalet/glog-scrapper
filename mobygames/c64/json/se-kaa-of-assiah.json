  "description": "<i>Se-Kaa of Assiah</i> is a single player text adventure with graphics.<br><br>This is a tale of good vs evil. The Wise Ones maintained order and peace for many, many years until the coming of the Dark Hordes. These evil creatures had one aim, to create havoc and mayhem wherever they went. They stole the Wise One's three artifacts of power, the Rod of Light, The Hammer of Vib-Ra, and the Casket of Vib-Ra. Robbed of their powers the Wise Ones were unable to hold the Dark Hordes at bay.<br>\nLegend tells of a warrior who will enter the Dark Hordes' fortress, the Castle of the Dead, and who will not only retrieve these artifacts but who will also relocate them to their rightful homes thus restoring the power of the Wise Ones and ridding the land of evil.<br><br>This game is a two part adventure. Episode One is the exploration of the Dark Hordes' fortress and escape with the artifacts. Episode two, which can only be accessed once episode one has been completed, concerns the restoration of the artifacts to their rightful homes.<br><br>The text parser allows simple sentences and multiple commands to be entered. The game can be saved but only when the player is quitting the game. \n",
