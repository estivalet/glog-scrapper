Contains <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick/game,Ultima+IV\">Ultima IV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick/game,Ultima+v\">Ultima V</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick/game,Ultima+VI\">Ultima VI</a>.<br><br>This ties the second 'trilogy' of the Ultima series (also known as the Age of Enlightenment) nicely into one complete package. This trilogy is based in the realm of medieval Britannia, which pits you in a relentless test of character.  In Ultima IV you are in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment while demonstrating the eight virtues.  Ultima V faces you against Blackthorn who has his own interpretation of the virtues.  Finally, in Ultima VI, you must resolve conflict between humans and gargoyles.",
