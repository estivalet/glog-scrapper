  "description": "In the year 2040 all major sports have been replaced by the exciting <i>Atomic Handball</i>. In this year handball has evolved to the point that, instead of a rubber ball, the game is played with a moon ball that can only be deflected with an electron paddle. Subatomic particles must be destroyed for points.<br><br>The game is a simple Breakout variant with only reason to break all the bricks present on the screen out.",
