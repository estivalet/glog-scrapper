  "description": "This three-part game loosely simulates the work of an ambulance driver rescuing people from a fire. First, you are trying to get across the city, which is represented as a maze of houses, to where a building is on fire. Avoid contact with the houses or other vehicles. A timer counts down from 1000 to zero, representing your score - zero means you're out of time.<br><br>There is no fire truck at the building when you arrive, so you have to catch the people who are in the building from falling to their doom, while avoiding falling flower pots. When three flower pots have hit you, this round of the game ends and the fire truck arrives. The goal is therefore to build up as many points as possible by avoiding these pots.<br><br>After the fire truck comes, you can enter the blazing building to scour for survivors. You have to rescue everyone in the building before the fires in the building burn you to death. This is done by touching them to lead them, then moving to a window, without being hit by the fireballs.",
