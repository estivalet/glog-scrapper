  "description": "You are a <i>Spitfire</i> pilot and you have been tasked to fly your plane across the English Channel and destroy any flying bombs on the ground and any enemy planes in the area. You also have to defend your base in England by shooting any flying bombs flying in the air towards your base. All this has to be done before your fuel runs out and you crash. You have six Spitfires to use but you can lose some if they are destroyed at your base. The game is a horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up with the screen scrolling left to right or right to left if you turn your plane. The game also scrolls upwards and downwards if you climb or lower your plane. You plane can take 10 hits before crashing or you fly downwards too fast and you hit the ground.",
