  "description": "<i>Jonny and the Jimpys</i> is a compilation of two exclusive games: <i>Bangers and Mash</i> and <i>Spellbound</i>.<br><br>In <i>Bangers and Mash</i>, you control Jonny who needs to collect three sausages and take them to his dog, Mash, while avoiding enemies known as Jimpys. If you come in contact with one of the Jimpys, then the sausages are stolen and you lose a life. <br><br>If a Jimpy follows you around, you can either pass through a series of gates that will alter the path or drop a maximum of two sausages. But if you choose to do the latter, you cannot pick up the sausage again, it will disappear in a few seconds, and you receive less points than you do giving all three to Mash. <br><br>You will advance a level when you have given Mash all the sausages in the current one. The game ends when you run out of lives.\n",
