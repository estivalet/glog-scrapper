Each player has his own characteristics and style of play as their 'favorite doubles' they like to throw.\nRegardless against whom you play they will become better as you progress towards the final.<br><br>A practice mode helps you to become familiar and more skillful at throwing the darts.<br><br>The game can be played by one or two players.",
