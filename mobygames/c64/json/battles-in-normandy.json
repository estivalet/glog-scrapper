  "description": "<i>Battles in Normandy</i> is a turn-based wargame employing hex grids, built on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/battlefront\">Battlefront</a> engine. It deals with the 1944 Allied landing in German-occupied Normandy during the Second World War. The eight scenarios included are: Omaha, Utah, Sword, Cherbourg, Carentan, Villers-Bocage, Goodwood and Epsom.<br><br>As with <i>Battlefront</i> the command scale is at the corps level. The battle system incorporates the factors of adverse weather and terrain, supply, experience and morale. A complete range of unit types is provided. Victory depends on seizing the key locations within the turn limit.",
