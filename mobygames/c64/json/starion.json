  "description": "Aliens using a time machine have changed several crucial events in earth history. As <i>Starion</i>, a rookie starfighter pilot in 2010AD, you must correct these, in a hybrid of puzzle and action.<br><br>There are 243 sectors to correct, each representing a year. After selecting one, you are involved in first-person space dogfighting, viewed from within your cockpit. Pay attention to your multi-directional scanner to locate ships and mines. There are also indicators for your fuel and oxygen levels, pitch and yaw, and engine temperature.<br><br>Shot enemies release letters, which must then be flown over. Once an area is cleared, you must use the letters to form a word. Then, fly through the time gate, and decide which historical event the word relates to.",
