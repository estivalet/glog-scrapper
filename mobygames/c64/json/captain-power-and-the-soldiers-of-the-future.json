  "description": "<i>Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future</i> is a 2D space shooter.<br><br>Based on the '87 TV series <i>Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future</i>, this computer game of the same name sends you into the year 2147. Earth is a wasteland, and the evil Lord Dread rules with an iron hand. Only a small group of high-tech soldiers under the command of the charismatic Captain Power battles the nemesis and his band of Bio Dread henchmen.<br><br>None of this matters in the game though. Instead, you launch into two space shooter sequences. Part one, the training mission, has you destroy three Dread drones in a cockpit-view shooting range. Part 2, the Attack on Volcania, is a 2D sidescroller in which you eliminate approaching enemy spaceships. If enough hostiles have died, you get to bomb the enemy lair. The ship-shooting / hideout-bombing sequences are repeated until the fortresses shields are finally down.<br><br>You will find more information about the Captain Power TV series in the trivia and links sections.",
