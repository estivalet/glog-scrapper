  "description": "<i>Die Hard</i> is a game based on the movie of the same name. A group of terrorists has taken control of a high rise tower in an attempt to take $600 million. Your job is to rescue your wife who is trapped in the building and stop the terrorists.<br><br>When the game was ported over from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/die-hard\">DOS version</a>, it was made into a side-scroller due to the limitations of the Commodore 64. The basic idea is the same. You must explore the various areas of the building to get what you need to stop the terrorists. Fight enemies you encounter because if you leave the screen, they follow.",
