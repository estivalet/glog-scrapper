  "description": "Concentration was a popular game show in the mid-to-late 1980s, and this game was adapted from that television program. The sequel, Classic Concentration 2nd Edition, features the same interface with even more puzzles to solve. <br><br>Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. Solve the rebus that lies beneath 25 numbered panels (a rebus is a puzzle in which words are represented by combinations of pictures and individual letters). The tiles have words denoting game prizes (&quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Camera&quot;, &quot;Telescope&quot;, for example), and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again. As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.",
