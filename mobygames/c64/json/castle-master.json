  "description": "<i>Castle Master</i> is the fourth and final individual game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D game system (after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-station-oblivion\">Driller</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dark-side\">Dark Side</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Total+Eclipse\">Total Eclipse</a>). As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. <br><br>Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. <br><br>Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately. ",
