  "description": "While the screenshots on the back of the box may get players hopes up that they are getting a home port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-soccer-champ\">Hat-Trick Hero</a>, what they actually get may be a bit more humbling.<br><br><i>European Football Champ</i> is a soccer game viewed from a top down perspective with the pitch aligned horizontally. Players can choose the length of the game from 2 to 90 minutes.<br><br>Unlike the Amiga / Atari ST game with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/euro-champ-92\">same title</a> that only focused on European teams, this version of <i>European Football Champ</i> features 9 international teams:\nThe 5 teams that were in both <i>Football Champ</i> / <i>Hat-Trick Hero</i> arcade games:<br>\nArgentina, Brazil. England, , Germany, Italy<br>\nThe 2 Football Champ exclusive teams:<br>\nFrance and Spain<br>\nThe 2 Hat Trick Hero exclusive teams:<br>\nJapan and USA<br><br>However this game lacks the Netherlands team which was in both of those Arcade games.\n",
