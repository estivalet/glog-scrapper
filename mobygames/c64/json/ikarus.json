  "description": "<em>Ikarus</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Joust\">Joust</a> clone in which players control a phoenix and must try to hit their opponent from a higher position. Pressing the fire-button causes the phoenix to flap its wings and fly upwards. Only when the phoenix is flapping its wings can players influence the direction of its flight. Successfully hitting an opponent from a higher position scores one point. The first player to score ten points wins the game.<br><br>Apart from a two-player-mode there is also a single-player quest mode, featuring ten levels with increasingly difficult opponents.",
