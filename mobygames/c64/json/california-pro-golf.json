  "description": "<i>California Pro Golf</i> is a golf game featuring two courses with 18 holes each. The hitting mechanics are similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Leader+Board\">Leader Board</a>. It is important to figure in the wind and to use the correct club which can be chosen out of 14. When hitting, the game is played in a 3D third-person perspective, but there is also an overhead map which can be used to get an overview of the course.",
