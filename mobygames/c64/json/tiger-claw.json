  "description": "<i>Tiger Claw</i> is a modern update of the classic Commodore 64 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bruce+Lee\">Bruce Lee</a>. Throughout its 24 screens, four stolen magic scrolls must be retrieved to finish the game.<br><br>Each screen is littered with platforms and ladders. Fighters, Daemons, Ninjas, Hounds or Birds randomly appear on screen which can be avoided or kicked out with karate chops. Not all screens are immediately accessible; Entrances to some screens open if you have disposed a certain number of enemies or killed a mid-level boss. Also,  some platforms initially seem out of reach. By collecting special masks the hero gains extra abilities like double-jump or wall-jump to traverse further into the game.<br><br>Tiger Claw is on every platform it is released highly customizable:<ul>\n<li>Training mode: Improve your karate skills by beating wave after wave of new enemies.</li><br>\n<li>‘Versus’ mode: Compete against a second player on a single screen. Three- and four-player mode are also possible on C64 and Amiga.</li><br>\n<li>Difficulty: The game can be played in Easy, Standard and Hard mode. The higher the difficulty the more number of enemies with faster reactions appear and the floor having less friction.</li><br>\n<li>Classic Mode: Only available on the Amiga, Linux and Windows version, it lets you play the game with C64 graphics and sound.</li><br>\n<li>Jump: Only available on Amiga, Linux, Windows, it configures which button your joy pad will be used for jumping.</li><br>\n<li>Music: Lets you play any of the songs available in the game.</li></ul>",
