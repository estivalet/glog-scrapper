  "description": "You play as a worker at a gumball factory, where you must move through the ranks of the factory by successfully sorting colored gumballs using a Rube Goldberg-esque gumball sorting machine.<br><br>The player starts each day at 0830 with a set quota of gumballs they must successfully sort through the day.  Gumballs of different color are expelled from the machine in the top left corner, and they work their way through a series of complex devices to eventually be deposited from various slots at the bottom of the machine.  The player controls the motion of various levers within the machine to control the pathway of the different colored gumballs.  The player must then also move the colored carts at the bottom of the screen so that the correct colored gumball is deposited in each cart.  <br><br>The player has until 1700 that day to meet their quota of appropriately filed gumballs.  If the gumballs go in the wrong slot, or are lost within the machine, the quota of gumballs for the day increases.  If the end of shift at 1700 occurs before the player meets their quota, then they are fired.  The player works through progressively more difficult stages including: Worker, Foreman, and then Supervisor. Each increased level in difficulty increases the number of colors of gumballs, the quota, and the number of collecting colored bins.",
