  "description": "The Super Trux trophy is a hectic truck race across nine European cities. As one of the participants, you need to drive your truck through different tracks in places like London, Brussels or Paris and finish each section in the designated time. <br><br>Every track features hazards, like ups and downs which limit your visibility, roadworks reducing the road to a single line, and the many other participant trucks. At the end of every track the road forks and the player can choose the next stage in their route. This feature, taken from Sega's &quot;OutRun&quot;, makes every trip a new challenge.",
