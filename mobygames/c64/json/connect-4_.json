  "description": "Based on the board game of the same name, <i>Connect 4</i> is a strategy game where you have to place counters in an upright grid against the computer or another player and make a row of four counters of the same colour, vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Each player takes it in turns to put a counter in one of seven columns with the placed counter sliding down as far as it can go. The game is over when a player has made a row of four counters and the score total between players is shown after the game. The computer has four skill levels (1-4) with one being the easiest.",
