  "description": "<i>The Lost Caves 8</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> variant. The gameplay mechanics are identical to its big brother: the player controls a miner who needs to collect diamonds which are spread out in the levels. Those levels are also full of dirt which is removed when walking over it. When the field directly under a rock is empty, it falls downwards while killing everything in the way - both the player character and enemies. Those enemies should obviously be avoided because they kill the player when touched; the game is over as soon as all lives are gone. The goal of each level is to collect a certain number of diamonds.<br><br>While its predecessors were aimed at <i>Boulder Dash</i> experts, this installment uses a traditional difficulty spike: the 32 levels are divided into four difficulties which range from easy to very hard. There are also intermission levels which present a puzzle to solve - success gives an extra live; failing has no consequence.",
