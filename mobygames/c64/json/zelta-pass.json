  "description": "Players control a spacecraft who must make its way through wave after wave of enemy fire and defeat the mothership at the end of each one. The craft is equipped with two built-in lasers which can be used to destroy enemies. Some waves require the player to navigate their ship through a specific path, making sure to avoid coming into contact with any walls.<br><br>If the craft collides with an enemy or hits a wall, it is destroyed and a new one take its  place.  Players are supplied with three ships, and if all of them are destroyed, the game is over. <br><br><i>Zelta Pass</i> was created using the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/shoot-em-up-construction-kit-\">Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit</a>.",
