  "description": "Sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/athena\">Athena</a>, the 2D side-scroller which starred a stylized Manga version of the Greek goddess Athena as she set out to find adventure in the mortal world.<br><br>This game features Athena Asamiya, a descendant of Princess Athena, who uses her new psychic powers (hence the game's title, <i>Psycho Soldier</i>) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu, thus allowing simultaneous two players gameplay.<br><br>The gameplay consists of the usual run and jump fare typical of the genre with the added feature of a constantly scrolling background, which, added to the many &quot;option&quot;-style power-ups and Athena's own psychic blasts make the game a strange shooter/platformer hybrid.",
