  "description": "Eden has been successfully colonised, by creating several domed cities. Society is rigidly functioning, unemployment, crime and poverty all non-existent. The economy functions on fines rather than taxes, making for a plethora of petty rules and no penal punishment. Robot employees make everything run cheaply. Body part reselling allows hospitals to turn a profit. Robots can even control human reproduction. The end result is a society in which humans have no useful role. Who would live in a 'paradise' like this?<br><br><i>The Worm In Paradise</i> is the culmination of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Silicon+Dreams\">Silicon Dreams</a> series of interactive fiction. The Worm in Paradise is set about 50 years after the events of the previous game in the trilogy, Return to Eden. The game relies on strict timing and a day/night cycle (using a decimal clock with 10 100-minute hours) – return to your home before darkness falls, and don't expect robots to help with tasks which will not be finished in the day. Vital buildings can be located using colour-coded co-ordinates, but these change every time you load the game, so be careful to write them down.",
