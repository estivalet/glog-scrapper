  "description": "<i>Road to Moscow</i> is a strategy war game where you take the role of the German Army trying to take Russia on the Eastern Front in World War 2. The computer takes the role of the Russian Army. The game covers the whole of the Eastern Front from Finland to the Crimea with East at the top of the screen so you have to move your Army upwards. There are 10 skill levels (0 - 9) and you can play a whole campaign starting in 1941 or play four individual campaigns which are 1941 - Invasion, 1942  - 2nd Offensive, 1943 - Russian Offensive and 1944 - Battle for Poland. Each campaign lasts a year and you have two movements a month. <br><br>The idea is to move your units to other parts of the map, once you are happy with your choices the computer calculates how far the units would have moved taking in account of the weather and terrain. Any enemy units in the way will fight the other unit until they are defeated, surrender or retreat. Things to consider when moving is not to move too far from your supply lines as these will make your units useless. The terrain and weather play a big factor as well as attacks from the Russians. Try to complete your campaigns before the Russian winter set in and the Russians built up overwhelming forces. <br><br>The aim of the full campaign is to make the Russians surrender Moscow, Stalingrad, Leningrad and everything West of them. The game is viewed on a small part of the map from above with the units shown as icons.",
