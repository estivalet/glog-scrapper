  "description": "<i>Nibbly '92</i> is a worm/nibble/snake game, where the player controls a growing snake while eating dots in an enclosed maze.<br>\nThe maze is contained on a single screen, and the snake must eat all the dots without being blocked by its own body, in order to get to the next screen with a new maze.<br>\nWhen sixteen levels have been played, the game repeats the mazes with more difficulty for the player by increasing the snake growth, until eventually the maze becomes impossible to solve.<br>\nThis game is the predecessor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super%5fNibbly\">Super Nibbly</a>.",
