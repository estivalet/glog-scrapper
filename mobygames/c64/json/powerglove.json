  "description": "In an age where fossil fuels have been exhausted, Earth's power needs are supplied by thermal reactors under both the north and south poles. Unfortunately, an explosion has knocked out the north pole reactor, and without the power supplied from the reactor, billions are at risk of dying. You are sent in to engage the reactor's backup systems and restore the power supply. Protect yourself against the out of control maintenance robots within the reactor facility and use the control diamonds to enable the backups. You are the world's only hope!<br><br><i>Powerglove</i> is a metroidvania-style game originally created for Commodore 64 as an entry in the 2013 RGCD 16K C64 Game Development Competition (where it placed 3rd out of 15 entries). Later it was made available for Windows, Mac, and Linux using a pre-configured emulator.",
