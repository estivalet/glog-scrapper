  "description": "Yogi must travel across Jellystone Park to rescue his friend Boo-Boo, who has been kidnapped. Travel through 198 screens to reach him, collecting six toffee apples en route - these are converted into a code which allows Boo-Boo to be rescued without his kidnapper raising a fuss.<br><br>The park scrolls sideways, with Yogi moving into and out of the layered screens. It contains animals who can harm you on contact, as well as black holes and water hazards. Contact with the park ranger or tourists is also forbidden. Yogi must watch his energy level, which is kept up by swiping fish and pick-a-nick baskets. Boo-Boo must be rescued before he and Yogi have to hibernate for the winter. ",
