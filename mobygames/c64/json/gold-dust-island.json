  "description": "<i>Gold-Dust Island</i> is a strategy game for 2 - 5 players.<br><br>The players have been stranded on a gold laden tropical island, with their job being to collect as much gold as possible before escaping the island via boat.<br><br>The island contains a well for drinking water, a forest for boat building, and a gold field.  Each turn, a player can either move between different locations, dig for gold, work on building a boat, fill their well, fetch water, or trade with each other.  Gameplay time is limited by a tropical cyclone which will destroy all human life on the island if not escaped in time.  The players have a limited supply of water, starting with 10 days worth.  If they run out of water, they will die of dehydration, thus water supplies need to be maintained.  <br><br>The player who successfully builds a boat and has the most gold prior to the cyclone arriving is victorious.  <br><br>\n",
