  "description": "All of Tarkus and Eugene's friends have been kidnapped and you and a friend have to search seven sectors and find them all. If a two player game is selected then both wheelies play at the same time. Any sector can be chosen but the higher the sector the more Wheelies to rescue and more enemies to avoid or shoot. The game is viewed from above at an angle and you must guide your wheelies vertically up the screen which scrolls as you move. At the bottom of the screen is a pair of bottles. These contain both players energy and slowly decreases as you play. Touching or being shot by a baddy drains more energy. If the bottle is empty and you touch a baddy then it's game over. Mushrooms are scattered around the levels and will top up a small part of your energy while the occasional bottle found tops it up completely. Once the number of Wheelies have been rescued then you must reach the exit.",
