  "description": "Alien robots are attempting to burn down your city by entering buildings and setting them on fire. You have been tasked to enter each building separately with fire extinguishers and put out any flames that are started by the robots who enter the building. Each building is viewed from above with the whole building on the screen. The direction you move sprays the extinguisher in a small area and puts out any flames it touches. The flames though spread too quick to be put out just by your extinguisher so you have a limited amount of firebreaks which can hold the flames back for a limited time. <br><br>Constant use of the extinguisher makes it overheat and when a gauge fills up it overheats and cannot be used for a short time. You also can only use the extinguisher for so long before it disintegrates but you do have more that can be used. If you are surrounded by flames then you are killed and you lose one of three lives. When all the flames have been put out then you move to a bonus screen which sees you making a path for points before the time runs out. Complete the bonus screen and it's onto the next building.",
