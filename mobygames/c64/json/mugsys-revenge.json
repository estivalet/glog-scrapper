  "description": "As in the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mugsy\">Mugsy</a> this strategy game is presented in a highly visual style with lots of detailed comic-book style stills and short animations. As a gangster in 1919, you see an opportunity to make money by illegally supplying alcohol during the Prohibition era in the US. Hints as to all decisions in the game are given through textual conversations with your assistants - these can include how much booze to produce, how big a bribe to give, and whether to invest in your own Speakeasy bar later on.<br><br>Unlike the original game, there are some arcade sequences which involve running around and shooting down the police as they try to arrest you.  The character can be hit up to 5 times but it only takes one shot to take out a cop. After each of the game's 10 years you receive a screen updating you on your progress, as well as a special one if you and your business survives the full decade.",
