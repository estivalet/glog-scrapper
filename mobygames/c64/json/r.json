  "description": "In this logical game you have to move a sphere around cogs to collect a formula in the correct order. To move between cogs you press the space bar at the point they meet. Holding down W will allow you to move the opposite way the cog is moving but here you move slower, releasing W allows you to travel faster the way the cog is moving. Some cogs have baddies on them and you must time your transfer to it without being hit by it.<br><br>On the screen you see a small part of the game area. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, lives, level and parts of the formula collected.",
