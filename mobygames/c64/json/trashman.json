  "description": "While few young people aspire to the role of a Dustman, New Generation Software felt they would enjoy pretending to be one in this innovative arcade game.<br><br>Each section presents you with a road of houses, drawn from forced-perspective 3D, with flick-scrolling as you move up the road. Each house's dustbin must be collected, emptied and replaced within the time limit, which is indicated by the Bonus timer at the top of the screen. If this reaches zero, you receive the first of 3 warnings -  a third sees you out of a job.<br><br>Setting foot on the grass causes the bonus to drop more quickly, and there are additional hazards to avoid, including the local cars, which appear to be driven by maniacs, and cyclists and barking dogs, which can both injure you and cause your movement to slow.  Once all the bins have been emptied walking up to the top of the street will complete the level.",
