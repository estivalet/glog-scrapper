  "description": "<i>Stuntman Seymour</i> is a side-scrolling platform game. The protagonist, Seymour, as a stuntman must make his way through four movie sets with different themes. <br><br>There are numerous enemies on each level, and collision with an enemy or its projectile, or falling into water causes Seymour to lose a life (he has 5 of them). Seymour can defend himself by shooting bullets that travel forward, or tossing bombs that fly directly upwards and then fall (there's a limited amount of bombs, but more can be collected on the way.) The levels also have score-giving items to collect. At the end of each level, Seymour fights a giant boss that jumps around and tosses bombs. ",
