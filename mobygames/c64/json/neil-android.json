  "description": "In the year 2099, the spaceship EPIC makes another one of her journeys when she is suddenly caught in a plasma storm, forcing her off course into unmapped. Due to the damaged caused by the storm, the EPIC was forced to land on an uninhabited planet to make urgent repairs. While on the planet, the ship's crew had no idea that an unknown virus made its way onto the ship. Upon returning to the EPIC's home base of Altontron, the crew became aware that the ship had been infected by the alien life form.<br><br>They have sent an android called NEIL to get rid of the aliens. Each room of the ship contains nine green aliens that NEIL needs to destroy. As well as these aliens, there are also robots that come in the room from time to time. When shot, these robots leave behind cells, which give NEIL extra ammunition, allow him to replenish his air supply, or use a smart bomb which kills all aliens in the room. Finding a turbo lift allows NEIL to travel between floors.\n",
