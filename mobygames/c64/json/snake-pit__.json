  "description": "<i>Snake Pit</i> is a fast-paced game where the player controls a character shaped like a grinning face. The goal is to eat up all the eggs that fill up the single screen field entirely and survive as long as possible to reach the next stage. Also in the field are multiple snakes with a different colour. They cannot escape until you make a hole in their wall by eating the eggs there. Only the red snake is able to move about right away. As soon as the snakes are on the loose they start eating the eggs too and the player's character needs to avoid their heads. Their body also gets longer with each egg they eat and that way they can block the path. There is a strategy to it by keeping the snakes walled in as long as possible while avoiding the red snake.<br><br>The goal is to eat all the eggs so the second stage starts. It has different gameplay as now the goal is to eat the snakes by biting their tails. The game keeps track of the score and the high score is registered.",
