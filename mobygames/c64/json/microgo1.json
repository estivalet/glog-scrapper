  "description": "<i>Microgo1</i> is an early computer adaption of the classic Chinese board game known best under the name <i>Go</i>. The board comes in a smaller 9x9 layout instead of the normal 19x19 layout. You can choose from playing against a computer or against another human player or watch a short tutorial which shows how to play the game. You can choose from several difficulty levels, resulting in a different handicap (the human or computer player starts with one or more stones already on the board). The NES/Famicom version of the game, released under the title <i>Igo: Ky? Roban Taikyoku</i> also features little ninja mascots tossing the &quot;stones&quot; on the board.",
