  "description": "<i>Moonspire</i> is a flip-screen exploratory sci-fi shmup. The game features over 260 screens to fight through and elaborate firing mechanics. The title is set on Arcturus 7, and involves an alien race called the Draxx that the player has to infiltrate. The Draxx had invaded and then called back their forces to the far side of the planet's only moon - taking with them the control orbs from the now rapidly cooling thermal-boosters.<br><br>This halts the terraforming process and is reverting the planet back to an inhabitable and desolate ice world. The player has to infiltrate the Draxx Moonspire, cause as much devastation as possible and reclaim the stolen orbs.\n",
