  "description": "The famous animated TV series by Hanna-Barbera spawned a film, and ultimately this licensed game, which contains 8 levels alternating between side-scrolling dodge-and-manipulate and driving gameplay. All four members of the Jetson family have a themed level.<br><br>The driving sections take place within George's Jetcar, and you must slow down for the speed-limited areas and beware of black holes.<br><br>At the beginning of the game you are George Jetson, labourer of the Spacely Space Sprockets company in 2062. Your boss Mr. Spacely wants you to work, but you want to collect money and have a fun. So after the boss ordinary order you can explore the company as usually, collect money bills and useful items, avoiding dangerous robotic mechanisms and Mr. Spacely himself. <br><br>On further levels, other Jetsons family members must do the same things, but at their own locations. Level 2 involves taking Jane out of her booby-trapped home, level 3 sees Judy trying to get a kiss form pop heartthrob Jet Screamer, and finally Elroy is locked in at school and has to escape.<br><br>You have to activate the items hidden behind the hatches with buttons. These allow you to progress on level, for example, fix an elevator with wrench. Time presses and you have to complete your mission quickly.",
