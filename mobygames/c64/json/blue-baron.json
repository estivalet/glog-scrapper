  "description": "You are the <i>Blue Baron</i> and you have been tasked to complete 12 missions by bombing selected targets to help the allies win the war in 1918. In this side view horizontal scrolling shooter you must fly your plane, find the target, bomb it and then return home. You start on an airfield and when you are ready you take off before facing other aircraft and balloons that need shooting or avoiding. You are able to take four hits from the enemy aircraft's and balloons and if you take more, then your plane is destroyed and you lose one of three lives. A fuel gauge will also decrease as you fly but certain aircraft when shot leave behind a fuel token or a hit token.<br><br>Early targets only require one hit from your bomb but later missions see targets requiring more than one hit but you can only carry one bomb at a time. You have to land back at your airfield to pick up another bomb but here you can also re-fuel and reset your hit points. A second player can also play and his job is to drop the bomb as well as direct your gun fire to hit the other planes.",
