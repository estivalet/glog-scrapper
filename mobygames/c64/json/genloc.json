  "description": "<i>Genloc</i> is a platform game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hawkeye\">Hawkeye</a>. The scientist Dr. Klein has created a &quot;genmanipulated dragon&quot; which has escaped from his lab. The hero, Shimon, must now destroy the dragon eggs to stop the beast from breeding. <br><br>The game consists of three levels. On each level the player must travel back and forth, in order to find and destroy eggs that appear one at a time. On his way, Shimon is menaced by undending hordes of respawning enemies of various kinds. The creatures can be avoided or shot with Shimon's gun. Shimon's energy, represented by a hourglass meter, gets depleted when he comes in close contact with the monsters, but it slowly regenerates on its own after a while. There is also a time limit, which is replenished once the player finds an egg. Running out of energy or time, or falling off the bottom of the screen, means losing a life. <br><br>After a specified number of eggs is found, the monsters disappear and a dragon boss appears, which must be killed to complete the level.
