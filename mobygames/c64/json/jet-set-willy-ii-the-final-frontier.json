  "description": "This platform game is the sequel of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/jet-set-willy\">Jet Set Willy</a> and basically just an extension of the previous game, adding 40 rooms to the existing 64 rooms of its predecessor. Each room its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers. When the game was loaded the user was given a reference to the  sheet and had to enter the four colours shown there.",
