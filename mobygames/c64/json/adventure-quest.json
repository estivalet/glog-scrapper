  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/colossal-adventure\">Colossal Adventure</a> is an interactive fiction game with a VERB NOUN interface. <br><br>The fantasy setting takes a clear influence from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Lord+of+the+Rings\">Lord of the Rings</a>. After centuries of harmony, Middle Earth has hit problems due to a cataclysmic sequence of events - a crop failure leading to animals turning violent, and then an attack from a mysterious enemy to the north. The evil Demon Lord Alagiarept is discovered to be responsible, and as such the Wizards are given a week to beat him, before Middle Earth must surrender.<br><br>You play a rookie magician with Meditation, Mysticism and\nMoneymaking skills. While the main war goes on, you attempt a much bolder mission - locate the four Stones-of-the-Elements and the Medallion of Life to enter Alagiarept's Dark Tower and kill him.<br><br>Your quest will take you through Beaches, Moors and Rocky Outcrops, as well as more specific locations such as the Pillar in the Desert, the Cave of the Sun-Dial and the Mills of God. Wolves, skeletal hands, sharks and octopuses must be dealt with.",
