  "description": "It's time to go down your local alley and have a game of bowling. <br><br>The game is viewed from behind your bowler at a slight elevated angle. Before you bowl you can move your bowler left or right to get the perfect position. There is an option to choose which angle to bowl by pressing the + or - key and also which hand you want by pressing R or L.<br><br>To bowl the ball when you are happy, you move the joystick forward and press the fire button to release the ball. You can't release the ball while not running. Don't go forward too far or it's a foul. The usual scoring is worked out by the computer. Here's to scoring 300.",
