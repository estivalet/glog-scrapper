  "description": "You are a stuntman and have to perform death-defying stunts, like riding a motorcycle avoiding obstacles and jumping on ramps, driving a car and jumping onto a helicopter before your car crashes against a wall, and later continue around on jetskis.<br><br>Every time you mess a trick up, the scene has to be cut. If there are too many cuts, you'll lose a &quot;life&quot;.",
