  "description": "Players control a car that must drive on the road along with other cars. To deal with them, the car is equipped with a smoke screen and weapons which players can use to kill them. From time to time, a helicopter flies overhead and will launch missiles and torpedoes at the player, but they can be destroyed with missiles which their car is also equipped with. If the player's car comes into contact with enemy fire or collides with other cars, the player loses a life.",
