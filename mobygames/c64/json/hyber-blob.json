  "description": "<i>Hyper Blob</i> is set on the planet Cubos on which the player works a tourist guide. Unfortunately he has to take care of a Blobpods tourist group: mindless bouncing balls.<br><br>The 100 side-scrolling levels consist of differently positioned blocks, e.g. as stairs or with gaps. The Blobpods bounce from left to right and only bounce back when they bump into a block. If they fall into a gap, they die. The player controls a cursor used to pick up blocks and drop them at another place: building a safe path is the only way to save the Blobpods. Special blocks include immovable blocks, mutant blocks (which cause the touching blob to eat up all blocks it touches) and blocks which disintegrate after blob contact. To complicate things, there is also a time limit for each level.",
