  "description": "In the third game of the adventure game series <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Zork\"> Zork</a>, you are once again a nameless adventurer, only this time you won't travel through a beautiful magical land, but are immediately cast into a deep dungeon. Like in a dream, you hear a mysterious voice telling you that you have passed all the tests but one. When consciousness returns to you, you find yourself on the endless spiral of stairs, with only your trusty lantern near you... will you be able to survive the horrors of the Dungeon?<br><br>Like its predecessors, <i>Zork III: The Dungeon Master</i> is a text adventure game. You read descriptions of rooms and then interact with the game by typing commands. As all early <i>Zork</i> games, it is very easy to get stuck in the game, so you'll have to reload several times in order to find the correct way.",
