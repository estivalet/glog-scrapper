  "description": "Nick Razor's pride and joy was his brand new 'Hot Hatchback' Space Cruiser.  He had spent all his last salary cheque, earned as a galactic dust man, on buying it.  Then it is stolen and the careless thieves press the hyperspace button by accident.<br><br>Nick traces his 'wheels' to the remote Ice Temple and discovers that, far from being the innocent entertainment centre it claims, the building is a thermionic reactor being controlled by aliens to remove the planet's energy.<br><br>The whole planet is cooling down at such a rapid rate that it is turning into an icy waste and the Aliens are using the energy to fuel rocket warships destined to conquer the Earth.<br><br>In order to destroy the dastardly plan Nick must remove all eight pieces of the reactor and dump them down the refuse-crusher chutes.  It's not going to be easy and will use all Nick's past working experience but Nick is mankind's only hope!",
