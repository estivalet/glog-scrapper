I can hear the birds singing in the summer sunshine, together with the fresh country air.&quot;</i><br><br>Thus starts the game, plunging the player straight into a text adventure where the object is to explore this land, find the eponymous Crystal Frog, and return with it. The player's progress is measured as a percentage score and the maximum possible score of 100% can only be achieved by visiting every location and using specific objects.",
