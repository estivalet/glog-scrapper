  "description": "<i>Hollywood Poker Pro</i> is a strip poker game and the successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hollywood-poker\">Hollywood Poker</a>. The poker variant of choice is Draw Poker. The gameplay is similar to most other games of this kind: the player chooses one of four girls and plays poker against her. If he runs out of money, the game is lost - if she runs out of money, she loses a part of her clothes. If she is successful, she can buy back a part of her wardrobe. The AI adapts to the player's style, but this is only true within the same match.<br><br>The goal is to strip the girl naked. The Amiga and C64 version allow to zoom into the photographs.",
