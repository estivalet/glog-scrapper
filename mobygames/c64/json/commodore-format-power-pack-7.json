  "description": "Issue 7 of Commodore Format magazine came with a cover-mounted cassette containing three former full-price games, plus 5th Gear from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Hewson\">Hewson</a>'s Rack-It label. Shortly after this, a law was passed limiting UK 8-bit magazines to a maximum of 2 former commercial games per issue. The games are: <ol><li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/crystal-castles\">Crystal Castles</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/uridium\">Uridium</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/blue-max\">Blue Max</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5th-gear\">5th Gear</a></li></ol>The provided copy of 5th Gear was bugged, and prone to crashing if the Datasette cassette deck was stopped or knocked. A fixed version was included with issue 28, nearly 2 years later.",
