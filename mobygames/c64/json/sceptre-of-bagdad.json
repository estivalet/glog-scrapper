  "description": "You're Caliph - king of Iraq. An evil wizard from distant land broke into your palace, transforming it into a maze of traps and puzzles, and taking the sacred Sceptre of Bagdad. Unless you can recover it, your spell as ruler is finished.<br><br>Featuring lots of enemies to dodge, platform-style jumps and object manipulation, the game resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Dizzy\">the Dizzy games</a>, with a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Set+Willy\">Jet Set Willy</a>-influenced setting. There are many objects you need to use, but you can only carry two at a time. You have three lives with which to complete the game.",
