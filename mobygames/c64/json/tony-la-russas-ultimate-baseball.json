  "description": "Tony La Russa's Ultimate Baseball (named after the manager of the Oakland Athletics at the time) was Strategic Simulations' short-lived foray into sports games.  The simulation here is of a full season of major league baseball.  You can view statistics for every team, and play with one or two players, or manage teams while the computer plays through the season for you.  Players have injury records and performance streaks.<br><br>The game could be enhanced with several add-on disks, sold separately: Great Teams 1901-1968, A.L. Stadiums, N.L. Stadiums, Classic Stadiums, and Fantasy Manager, which let you draft players into new teams and leagues.",
