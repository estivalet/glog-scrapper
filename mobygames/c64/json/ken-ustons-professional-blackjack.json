  "description": "As suggested by the title, this adaptation leverages the methods of famous blackjack strategist <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,417016/\">Ken Uston</a>.  Focusing on completeness, the game simulates tables at more than 70 casinos across the US, and implements their different house rules in minute detail - from the number of decks to dealer behavior, surrendering, splitting, doubling, insurance bets and more.  A table can have up to 7 players; each can be controlled by a human or by the CPU, and given different cash amounts and betting units.  For even more variation, players can create their own casinos and customize the rules to their liking.<br><br>The game's stated purpose is to teach Uston's card-counting system.  To that end, it includes a series of drills to practice the four different strategies, arranged by skill level.  Computer-controlled players can be set to use any of these strategies during a game.  For further instruction, the game offers card count data displays, keeps statistics and can rate the players based on their performance given their chosen strategy.",
