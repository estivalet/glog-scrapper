  "description": "Charlie Brown’s ABCs is a simple educational game aimed at children ages 4 to 7. The game is intended to teach both the alphabet as well as the location of letters on the keyboard. <br><br>The main screen of the game shows the entire alphabet with both uppercase and lowercase letters. When a letter is pressed, an animation of a Peanuts character interacting with an object starting with that letter appears, accompanied by music. For example, if the letter ‘K’ is pressed then an animation of Charlie Brown flying a kite will appear. <br><br>Similar to Odyssey games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/roulette-states\">Roulette, States, </a> this game utilizes peripherals and was packaged with 10 learning activities and a set of flash cards.
