  "description": "<i>Pyramid</i> is a single player text adventure.<br><br>The player takes the role of an archaeologist. The game starts in a tent on the site of an excavation. The object of the game is to explore the site and to recover four treasures and bring them back to the tent.<br>\nProgress through the game is measured by the player's score, the maximum possible score being 100.<br><br>The game's parser allows the player to enter long commands but it assumes that the last word is an object and the first word is a verb, ignoring all the rest. So 'Go very slowly and quietly to the West' is interpreted as 'Go West'. The game does allow two part commands such as &quot;Put Sword&quot; at which point the game will ask 'Where?' and the player responds with 'Table' or whatever is appropriate. ",
