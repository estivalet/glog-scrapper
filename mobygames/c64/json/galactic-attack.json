  "description": "In this game, players have to launch a spaceship from a vessel that moves left and right repeatedly until the fire button is pressed. After the ship is released, it must be guided through a field of orbs (that also move left and right) to one of the four pads at the bottom of the screen. While avoiding the orbs, the ship can be slowed down by releasing fuel so it makes navigating to the pads easier. The pads each consist of three layers, and a layer is removed when the player's ship lands on it and a small blue alien enters it. Once done, the player needs to guide the alien back to the vessel. The invaders will get released from the orbs, but the player can shoot them with a bullet. ",
