  "description": "As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some spares.<br><br>There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).",
