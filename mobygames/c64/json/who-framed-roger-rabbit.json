There are 4 levels in the game, 2 of which are driving levels (levels 1 &amp; 3).

There are pick-ups to help you on your way.<br><br>Level 2 is the Ink &amp; Paint Club. The will is on one of the tables. Roger has to pick up all the pieces of paper the penguin waiters put down, whilst avoiding the alcohol and gorilla bouncer.<br><br>Level 4 has you in Judge Doom's warehouse trying to save your wife, Jessica from the dip truck. You have to use gags to progress and make the weasels laugh themselves to death, literally!",
