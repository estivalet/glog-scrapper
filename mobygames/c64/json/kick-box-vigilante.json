  "description": "You have been invited to the Siandown Temple by The old Masters to fight some of their fighters because the Masters believe no Westerner can become a Kick Box Master. Obviously the Masters don't want to be proved wrong so they have arranged for you to face four of their best kick boxers. <br><br><i>Kick Box Vigilante</i> is a fighting game with each fight shown from the side shown on the whole screen. You have various moves at your disposal which are controlled by a joystick. Each fighter has five Yin and Yan symbols at the top of the screen and if a fighter is hit then they lose a part of the symbol, lose all five symbols and it is fight over. You have to beat each fighter twice to move onto the next one and if you don't beat them within the time limit then it is game over.",
