  "description": "Your aim in life is to be the greatest train robber in the Wild West, a multi-stage task. Your character has plenty of attacking kicks and punches to use on anyone who gets in his way, starting with the local banker, and then some coyotes roaming the plains, who are easier dodged than killed. After this, you find yourself atop the train, attacking a succession of guards in one-on-one beat ‘em up duels, each of which must be won outright within the time limit to avoid losing a life. Many of these shoot at you, so dodge their shots as you attack them. The game offers a practice mode, in which you have 32 lives to try to improve your skills, and a ‘normal’ mode in which you have unlimited continues as long as you can reach the high-score table with each continue – in this mode, as in the ‘advanced’ mode in which you must always start again from scratch, you have 5 lives",
