  "description": "<i>Cartel$ &amp; Cutthroat$</i> is notable for being one of the first business sims in existence. 1-8 players compete for profit in this simulation of cut-throat competition that is a simulation of the basic tenets in finance and economics.  Understanding these concepts is key to winning the game, which involving setting your production level and price where marginal costs equal marginal revenues, borrow funds when prime rates are low to expand, and minimize cost per unit. You must also pay careful attention to the state of the economy and consumers' tastes, both of which change constantly. If you're unsure of what to do, your advisor in the game will guide you in the right direction.\n",
