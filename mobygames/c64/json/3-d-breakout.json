  "description": "<i>3-D Breakout</i> is based on the classic game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/breakout_\">Breakout</a> where you have to deflect a ball with a paddle and destroy a collection of bricks. Instead of deflecting the ball vertically, this version has you sitting behind the paddle deflecting the ball into the screen to destroy a  wall of bricks in the distance. If you let the ball pass the paddle then you lose a life, lose all lives and it's game over.",
