  "description": "<i>Passport to London</i> is a maze and strategy game.<br><br>Welcome to London.  You are a tour guide in charge of 12 very enthusiastic tourists.  Alas, your tourists have two nasty habits.  They tend to wander off and get lost, and they like to take home 'souvenirs' of priceless British treasures.  Your mission is to track down the missing objects.<br><br>The player must investigate 9 separate tourist sites in London.  Each location contains a maze of tourists, and the player must locate the tourists and bobbies in each location.  They will give information on which tourist may have stolen which item.  Of note, tourists will move between locations every 15 - 30 minutes.  Once the player has determined which tourist has stolen which item, they must be tracked down, and accused of which item they stole and where they stole it from.  The player will occasionally encounter ghosts, who randomly transport the player to a different location.<br><br>The player has 100 pounds and 12 hours to find the missing items.  The player can travel by bus, taxi, underground, or walking.  All 4 options use a different amount of time and money.  The game is over when the player has run out of money or time, or has collected all missing items.",
