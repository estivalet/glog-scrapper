  "description": "<i>Eoroid</i> is a text-moded puzzle solving game, played on a 20x15 board. The main goal requires removing all the blocks from the board within limited numbers of moves. By clicking on a single spot, the player affects all the fields around by their reversal, including the chosen one - filled block disappears and a blank spot is replaced with filled block. Basically, each taken action reverses simultaneously 9 fields, one in the middle, and 8 around (3x3 square).",
