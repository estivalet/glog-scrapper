  "description": "After trying to destroy 'The Creator' in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/creators-revenge\">Creators Revenge</a>, you are once again attempting to destroy him in his heavily guarded fortress in this top view flick screen maze game. The Creator is in a sealed chamber and you have to move around the fortress through multiple exits on each screen looking for three keys so you can open a room containing a power source which keeps the chamber sealed. The keys have to be collected in order, with each key collected opening the room containing the next key. Once all three keys are collected then you can open the power source room and destroy it before finally entering the chamber containing The Creator and destroying him. <br><br>You can bring up a map at anytime which shows the location of the keys, power source and the chamber containing The Creator. In some of the rooms are various creatures that can be avoided or shot and if you touch one then you lose one of ten lives. If you stay too long in a room then a creature appears and follows you around the room until you leave the room as it cannot be shot. Some rooms are full of water that cannot be touched and you can only cross it if you find a boat. Bonus items are scattered around the fortress and these can be collected for bonus points.",
