  "description": "In this football management game you are the new manager of a team as well as it's striker and you have to take your team from the English 4th Division to the 1st Division winning domestic and European trophies on the way. If your management skills impress you have the chance to take charge of a European team or an International team with your ultimate goal to win the World Cup.<br><br>All the usual football management options are there including picking your team, buying and selling players, and giving a team talk. In team selection you can pick yourself and drop yourself if it's for the benefit to the team. The actually match highlights are text based with a clock ticking away with important parts of the game appearing. If your team have the ball to shoot at goal or if the opposition are about to shoot then the game changes to an arcade sequence. You see the goal from the halfway line at an elevated angle and you have a couple of seconds to move a bar which ether is the direction of your kick towards goal or which direction to move your goalkeeper.",
