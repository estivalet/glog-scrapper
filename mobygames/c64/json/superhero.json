  "description": "Five guardians threaten the peaceful existence of the people, and it’s you who’s been entrusted with saving them. <br><br>Lots of goodies have been hidden around the worlds to help you, ranging from swords and Power Boots to advanced ones such as Teleport Keys and an ESP Gauge, which guides you direction-wise. Many of these are only visible once you have the helmet. <br><br>After each Guardian dies you get a Deadzone bonus level, which can earn you an extra life if you escape unscathed. An advanced player status screen is included.\n",
