  "description": "<i>War Cars Construction Set</i> is a race game where you must race against the computer around a large maze viewed from above, collecting flags. Your vehicle also carries two rocks which only one can be deployed at a time. This will block your opponent for a short time. Each car has five lives and if you crash into the other car then you lose one of five lives. The game keeps going, letting you build up a score and it only ends when all lives are lost. <br><br>There are various flags scattered around the maze and these can affect the game. The bonus flag awards you with 100 points, the Car Flag gives you an extra life (maximum of five), the Rock flag gives you a rock (maximum of two) and the Chase Flag allows you to crash into your opponent or gives points if close to the car. As you race around there is a timer counting down. When it gets to Zero the car with the most flags gets a 100 point bonus for each flag collected. After a short time the timer resets and starts counting down again.<br><br>As the name of the game suggests, there is also a construction set which allows you to design up to five tracks. You must have at least ten corners or the computer won't be able to work out the locations of the flags. Also if the computer isn't happy with the track when you save then it will abort it.<br><br>",
