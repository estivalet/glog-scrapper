  "description": "After successfully being a train robber, Cactus Pete now has a $4000 bounty on his head. You play as Pete as you attempt to rob more locomotives by riding your horse alongside and attempting to grab onto a ladder. The game is viewed from the side at a elevated angle as you ride your horse alongside the train, and you can speed up or slow down but be careful of any cactus alongside the track which will make you fall off the horse. Push your horse for too long and a timer represented as your horse's energy will slowly decrease until it gets to empty and your horse collapses. <br><br>Once you have got onto the ladder you can climb onto the roof of the cars. As you move from right to left you have to navigate the gaps between cars as well as ducking if a tunnel approaches. Once you reach the last car you can drop into it and attempt to find two keys for the safe while avoiding the guard dogs. Touching one loses one of three lives. When you have your loot you need to get back on the roof to get to the front of the train to get back on your waiting horse. The next train awaits. Another player can play and you both take it in turns when the other player loses a life.",
