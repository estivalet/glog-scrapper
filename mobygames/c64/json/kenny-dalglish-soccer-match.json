  "description": "Kenny Dalglish was a hugely successful player for Celtic, Liverpool and Scotland, before becoming the first person to win the English league championship while both playing and managing (for Liverpool in 1985, also winning the FA Cup that year). This was his second licensed game, and is a side-scrolling action game featuring single matches played between a team in red and a team in blue, each of which can be any of 9 skill levels. Matches can be varied between 10 and 90 minutes. The ball is loosely controlled in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kick+Off%e2%80%99\">the Kick off series</a>, although it isn’t possible to pass the ball a short distance, so an element of hitting and hoping comes into play, especially as the ball can’t be curved far. The ball bounces quite heavily, and is very difficult to shoot on target from closer than 30 yards or so.",
