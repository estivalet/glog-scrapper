  "description": "The rich André Thelman used the last years of his life to build a deadly maze with 20 levels. Whoever passes it will find a valuable item at the end - and of course the protagonist wants to grab it. The player takes control of a boat with the one and only goal to find the correct teleporter to the next level. The boat has the ability to jump over holes and use a gun to shoot at robots which try to harm it. These robots come in multiple variants with different behaviour. <br><br>Progress is made more difficult by switch puzzles and special tiles, like ones which prevent the ship from turning around. Power ups like a level skip or extra lives can be picked up inside the levels, but they disappear after a short time. However, the picked up symbols don't get activated before finishing the current level. When the ship turns around, the whole level flips around it.",
