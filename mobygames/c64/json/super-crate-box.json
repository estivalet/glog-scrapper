  "description": "<i>Super Crate Box</i> is a hectic shooter set in a single screen area filled with an endless amount of enemies. They spawn near the top and then run down to disappear in a fire at the bottom or are killed by the player. When the player does not manage to kill them, they return enraged, with a different colour, and a much faster speed. The main goal of the game is to collect crates that spawn in different parts of the level. Only one crate appears at all times and when it is picked up by the player it reappears at a different part. Each crate builds up a counter but also supplies the player with a new weapon, discarding the existing one.<br><br>Three different areas can be unlocked as well as three modes per area, offering variations in the enemy strength and speed, or the spawn position. In each level different goals can be completed (usually based on collecting a number of crates). This unlocks new playable characters and weapons such as mines, a grenade launcher, a bazooka, a revolver, a laser rifle, a katana, and more.",
