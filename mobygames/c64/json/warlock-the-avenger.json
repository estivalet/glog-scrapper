The standard bad guys are there, as are items to pick up including health and extra weapons.<br><br>The game gives you one life, whcih represents the gradually declining amount of energy. You should get further on each go, with the difficulty curve being quite precise.<br><br>As a bonus, an exclusive conversion of Druid is included.",
