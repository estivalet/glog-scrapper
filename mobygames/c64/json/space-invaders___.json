  "description": "This conversion of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> stays very true to the original despite being written in BASIC. Game play is exactly the same with the player in control of a tank at the bottom of the screen firing at advancing aliens. The aliens fire back and the player can take cover behind bunkers. The bunkers give way a little bit easier than in the arcade version due to fewer pixels. The sound also tries to stay true to the original with the ever increasing speed of the beat when the aliens draw nearer.<br><br>Obviously the Commodore PET version does not feature any colour in its graphics. The Commodore 64 version does, but the aliens don't change color as they draw nearer.",
