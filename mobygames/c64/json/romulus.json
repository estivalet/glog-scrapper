  "description": "The task of de-bugging mega-chips for the Igos Transputer Company has fallen to you. Intelligent bugs are appearing and you have to stop them. In your Vector Module you enter the chip and try to stabilise the circuits. You enter various channels and must destroy all the bugs.<br><br>Once at the end of a channel you enter the transition stage which takes the form of three sub-games. In the first stage you have to remember a number of tones and colours and repeat them back in their correct order. The second stage displays three pairs of boxes, the lower boxes contain a moving pattern. You have to match the upper boxes with the lower boxes. The final stage is a competitive game against the computer. You must shoot nodes and  remove the computers node. The winner is the first to have six nodes on screen at the same time.<br><br><i>Romulus</i> is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up. You can steer the ship left or right. The joystick steers the ship and controls it's speed. The fire button shoots your weapon. Also seen on the screen is your score, lives and time.",
