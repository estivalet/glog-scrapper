  "description": "Inspired by the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/centipede_\">Centipede</a>,  a garden is in the height of summer but is full of unsavory creatures and a mutant mushroom monster called <i>Minipede</i>. You must blast the Minipede to clear a level as well as the other creatures including spiders, snails and ladybirds for bonus points over 15 levels. You sit at the bottom of the screen where you can move left or right, and forwards a short distance as well as backwards. The Minipede moves across the screen from the top and advances downwards when it reaches one side of the screen. Scattered around the screen in many numbers are mushrooms which can hinder your movements and when the Minipede hits one it changes direction. If you touch any creature then you lose one of four lives.<br><br>The C64 version has 14 different creatures while the C16 and VIC 20 have 10.",
