  "description": "Play as Plaqueman to fight the plaque D. K. This Plague Germ is covering all the teeth. Your weapons are the toothbrush and dental floss. All the while you must not come into physical contact with D.K. or you will be &quot;eliminated.&quot;  Your brush needs fluoride toothpaste to energize it. If you don't pass the toothbrush through the toothpaste it will not work. Floss has to be used to get the spaces in between teeth. If teeth start decaying you will get warning sounds.",
