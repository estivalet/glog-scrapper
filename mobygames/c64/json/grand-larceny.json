  "description": "You are standing outside a hotel and your mission is to enter the hotel and explore it to find the plans to a super computer. There are many rooms and floors to explore as you find objects in various places and various other characters. You must use certain objects in the correct places to proceed and interact with the other characters to find the plans and escape from the roof by helicopter.<br><br><i>Grand Larceny</i> is an adventure with arcade elements as you control your character with a joystick as you view him from the side and the screen scrolls when you move. Below the playing area is text that describes your current location and any objects in the area, and like a text adventure you type in commands to interact with your surroundings and objects.  There are only 24 verbs available that can be used.  The game also features music.",
