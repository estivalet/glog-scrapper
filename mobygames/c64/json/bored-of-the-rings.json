  "description": "No prizes for guessing the inspiration for this one. The Great Ring needs to be returned to Mount Doom, a treacherous task to be undertaken by Fordo the Boggit. Spam, Pimply and Murky are his country-bumpkin friends, and he will later meet with Bumbadil and Hashberry, two old hippies. The main quest involves meeting up with Legoland the Elf, Giblet the Dwarf and Aragont. <br><br>In keeping with the humour, familiar locations become &quot;the featureless plain below the pink mountain&quot;, &quot;Lake Anadin&quot; and the &quot;Land of the Personal-Stereo-Wearing Goblins&quot;.<br><br><i>Bored of the Rings</i> is an interactive fiction game with graphics made using Quill. The interface allows the player to take and use items using VERB NOUN commands, and talk to characters.<br><br>The game is split into three parts, accessed via passcodes. The tape also includes issue 1 of <i>Sceptical</i>, Delta 4's short-lived magazine on tape.",
