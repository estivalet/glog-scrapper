  "description": "Kokotoni Wilf has been sent on a bold journey through time, to recover the seven pieces of the Dragon Amulet. There are 63 screens across 6 times zones to trek through in order to find these star-like objects.<br><br>These screens are viewed from the side, and resemble <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Set+Willy\">Jet Set Willy</a>, except that Wilf can fly through them and hover at a precision point. With hazards ranging from dinosaurs to spears to spaceships, and pieces located in hard-to-reach places, you will need this extra skill, especially as you have no weaponry. Most screens have more than 2 exits, but some are dead ends or lead directly into hazardous points. On each world you can immediately access the first 3 screens.",
