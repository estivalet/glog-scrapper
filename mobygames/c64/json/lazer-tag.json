  "description": "<i>Lazer Tag</i> is a game based on the sports brand of the same name. The real activity involves walking around with guns and trying to &quot;shoot&quot; the other players - the only significant difference to paintball is that it uses infrared guns to register hits instead of physical projectiles. This game transplants this non-violent principle into a science-fiction scenario. The player takes the role of a cadet at the Lazer Tag Academy who tries to work his way up by solving laser tag challenges.<br><br>Every level is played against a time limit and has the goal to score as many points as possible. However, there are two different modes: rabbitoid and target. Rabbitoid is a classical deathmatch competition (well, except that there is no death) in which the competitors move around the playing field and try to find a balance between covering from enemy shots and scoring hits. In target mode, the AI takes over the moving part and the player's role is restricted to aiming.",
