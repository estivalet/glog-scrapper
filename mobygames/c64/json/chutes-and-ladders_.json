  "description": "<i>Chutes and Ladders</i> is a 1 - 4 player game of luck based upon the original board game from Milton Bradley<br><br>Players take turns spinning a wheel with the numbers 1 - 6, and moving along a board marked 1 - 100.  Players start in the bottom left hand corner of the board, with the goal to reach the top left hand corner of the board.  Along the way are chutes which drop the player to a lower level, and ladders which are shortcuts along the path.  Players choose from 1 - 6 playing pieces, and graphical vignettes accompany movements on chutes or ladders.  A computer opponent is available for single player games.  The first player to reach the end of the board is the winner.\n",
