  "description": "<i>Warlok</i> is a side view horizontal shooter with the screen scrolling constantly, and your mission is to navigate a tunnel deep underground while avoiding various obstacles and the walls over four stages. As well as avoiding touching the obstacles like bouncing balls and electrified doors that turn on and off, you can shoot certain objects as well, but if you are hit then you lose one of five lives. As you progress an energy gauge slowly decreases but there are energy capsules that can be shot to increase your gauge.<br><br>At the end of each stage are blocks that are protected by a force field that turns on and off. Inside is an object that needs releasing and collecting, and to do this you must blast the top four blocks away. The object then flies upwards and you must collect it before it reaches the top of the screen or it is a life lost and back to the start of the stage. There are five skill levels to choose from and also four levels to complete which are made up of the same four stages. A joystick is used to control your ship.",
