  "description": "The inhabitants of the pretty but insignificant planet Blot decided to leave to find a trendier planet, and escape being called the Blotians, a most unhip name.  Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.<br><br>Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it &quot;The Hippest Place in The Known\nUniverse&quot;.  Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.<br><br>The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers.  The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes.  He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.<br><br>The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages.  The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis.  At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.<br><br>The final stage on each level is a torture chamber, which takes place on a single screen.  Here Clyde must stop one of his friends being killed by the demons, who are using some sort of ACME device.  This is a puzzle game stage, where you must use the items in the room to kill one of the demons threatening Clyde's friend.  Clues can also be bought from the witch.  Whatever the outcome, either death will be gory, although the cartoony graphics of the game means that things aren't really graphic.",
