  "description": "<i>Thai Boxing</i> is a one-on-one fighting game shown from an isometric perspective (viewed from the side on the Amiga, Atari ST and C16 versions). Different joystick combinations let your fighter perform high, middle or low attacking moves as well as dodge or block his opponent's attacks. Fighters receive scores for successful attacks. The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins. Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.",
