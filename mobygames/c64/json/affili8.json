  "description": "<i>Affili8!</i> was developed for the <a href=\"http://www.minigamecomp.org.uk/php/2008.php\">annual Mini Game Competition</a> and was an entry for the 2k size category. <br><br>A clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pipe-dream\">Pipe Dream</a>, <i>Affili8!</i> is a puzzle game where the point is to build a network of pipes so that a marble can pass through it without crashing into the walls, the sides of pipes or falling into the void. <br><br>You can set up a pipe fragment somewhere in the 6x6 playfield by moving the cursor with your joystick and pressing Fire. On the right side of the screen, you see the pipe fragment which you are now placing; once you place it, a new, random one is chosen. Sometimes you'll get a bomb instead, which can destroy a single tile on the playfield. You have 5 seconds to place a tile (or a bomb) - if you wait too long, you lose one of four possible &quot;misses&quot;; when you lose them all, it's game over. When a marble passes through a pipe tile, this tile disappears. <br><br>The player receives a point for each placed tile, and 10 points when the marble passes through the pipes and reaches the checkered flag outside the playfield. Note that once the marble passes the flag, it will continue to roll through a small corridor outside the playfield and towards the entrance to the playfield again, so the game can be continued indefinitely.
