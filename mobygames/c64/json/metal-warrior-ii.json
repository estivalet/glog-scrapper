  "description": "Following the events of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/metal-warrior\">first Metal Warrior game</a>, Ian's war-metal band Cyberpriest splits up after a bitter conflict.  In the aftermath, Ian grows distant and unstable, and finally disappears - leaving a mysterious note.  The player takes control of Joan, AKA Phantasm - Ian's former bandmate (and his love interest) - as she sets out to explore the town, find clues about Ian's whereabouts, and uncover a new mystery.<br><br>The game plays much like its predecessor, being a side-scrolling action/adventure.  Phantasm will have to deal with characters both friendly and hostile, whether with words or with weapons; she starts out wielding only her fists, but more armaments can be found, as well as a host of other useful items.  New features include an experience system, which works somewhat like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Castlevania\">Castlevania</a>'s, and a password feature which lets you continue your game in case of a premature death.",
