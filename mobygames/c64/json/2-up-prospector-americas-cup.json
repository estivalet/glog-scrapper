  "description": "<i>2-Up: Prospector / America's Cup</i> is a double games pack that contains the following games:<br><br><b>Prospector: </b>In this single screen game viewed from an elevated angle, you have to search a vast plain for gold with your trusty metal detector. As you move around the plain and you are close to gold then the detector moves up and down making a noise. Once you are on the spot where the gold is then you automatically collect it. Your detector also warns you off any quicksand and if you walk on it then you die and it is game over. Bushrangers also make an appearance and you have to get away before they shoot you and it is game over. Walking in to a tunnel allows you to appear on the other side of the screen.<br><br><b>America's Cup: </b>A single screen game viewed from an elevated angle for two players where you have to race sailing boats around a course marked out by buoys, representing Australia and the USA. As you sail around the course you must avoid hitting the buoys or a siren sounds and you have to sail round the buoy again. Hitting the other boat gives you a penalty of having to turn 720 degrees. To win a race you have to complete so many laps of the course and the champion is the boat who wins four races.",
