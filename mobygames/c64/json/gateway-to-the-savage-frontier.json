  "description": "The party of adventurers has just escorted a caravan from the dwarven-ruled citadel Adbar to the city of Yartar. Now it's time to relax - the heroes head to the nearest tavern for food and drinks. However, somebody slips a drug into their food, and they all pass out. Upon awakening, they discover that they have been robbed of nearly all their possessions. The heroes must now begin everything from scratch. Investigating the matter, they unravel a much bigger and more sinister plot, which involves the evil organization Zhentarim and their plans for conquering the land.<br><br><i>Gateway to the Savage Frontier</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=gold+box\">Gold Box</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=ad%26D\">Advanced Dungeons & Dragons</a> role-playing game set in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=forgotten+realms\">Forgotten Realms</a> area known as the Savage Frontier. The gameplay is very similar to other games in the series, including creating and managing a six-member party of adventurers following the AD&amp;D rules, first-person view for exploration, and turn-based combat. A new addition is a world map travel mode, which includes enemy encounters, and character-specific side quests, which can be undertaken by finding and talking to certain non-playable characters.",
