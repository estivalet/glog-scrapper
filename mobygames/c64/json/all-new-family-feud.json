The amount of people (always a hundred total) who answered the same thing as the family equals the rewarded points. So for example if 20 persons said &quot;Madonna&quot;, the family would get 20 points when guessing it.\nand need to guess the most popular. There are three to five rounds and in the end the family with the most points win.",
