  "description": "<i>Delta Patrol</i> is a side-scrolling spaceship shooter involving waves of enemy formations in the Delta Sector of deep space. This horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up with 32 levels is something of a predecessor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/armalyte\">Armalyte</a>. It's set in the Delta region of space, in which the Hsiffan Khanate species have a powerful presence, using their technology to steal and analyze Terran ships.This environment is the home to outcasts and criminal elements of space pirates, misfits and alien creatures of mayhem. You've been assigned to the Delta Patrol, an elite intergalactic police squadron,for the express mission of taming this region of all antisocial and murderous entities.<br><br>The player is in control of his space cruiser engaging formations of the enemy, gaining power up points with victories over each attacking formation. There are obstacles to be avoided, and your default ship isn't strong enough to survive half of these, so in time-honored tradition power-ups are available via a credit system, while trying to intercept and connect with blocks for higher speed, faster fire rate, and increased energy. <br><br>Intense battle time erodes power and the player must constantly be aware of these opportunities to stay in action.The more credits you have, the more blue tokens (offering weapons) are offered - if you don't have many, fatal-to-touch grey tokens are unleashed. <br><br>Enemies encountered are the spiral Gyro, Space Donuts, and the alien mothership. Your own powerful cruiser is equipped with plenty of firepower, including the Fish Weapon, designed to disperse the atoms of even the most fearsome space creatures.<br><br>The 32 levels each feature different static hazards, as well as the actual Hsiffan forces, which come at you in programmed attack patterns.<br><br>The player must also be alert to avoid the Sea of Dreams, where gigantic waves can overwhelm his cruiser and drag him into the depths forever.",
