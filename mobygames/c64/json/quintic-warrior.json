  "description": "A holocaust has nearly wiped out mankind and the few survivors live together in a Space Dome protected by Quintic Warriors who as well as having intelligence, strength, tenacity and intuition, have the Quintic Factor. This gives a few people a fifth attribute which gives them a supreme fighting ability as well as cunning and survival instinct. You are one such person who has the factor and you are on patrol around the dome looking for any threat in your spacecraft. Out of the blue, Zorinian Mutants have started to attack the dome by slowly marching in various rows towards it. As you blast and destroy the mutants you realise that the main defences of the dome have gone haywire and are actually aiming their fire towards you. To make matters worse, a Zed Ramer has been brought along to aid the destruction of the dome and the people inside.<br><br><i>Quintic Warrior</i> is a top view single screen shooter and you control your spacecraft in multiple directions blasting the mutants who move slowly up the screen in various rows over various levels. As you blast the mutants, you must avoid the fire of the dome's defences which are three guns on the sides and the bottom of the screen and they keep firing lasers at you but will only destroy you where all three lasers meet. If you are destroyed then you lose one of three lives but if any mutant reaches the top of the screen then it is game over. A Zed Rammer makes an appearance during a level and this moves down the side of the screen firing across the screen. Once all mutants are destroyed then you move to the next level and the starting level can be selected at the start of the game (0-21).",
