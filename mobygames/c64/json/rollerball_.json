  "description": "A variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/qix\">QIX</a>, in <i>Rollerball</i> the objective is to trap the ball the game is named after by filling 75% or more of the playfield using your 'space scriber'. If the ball comes in contact with you or your trail before you finish closing off the section, you lose a life.\nThe primary difference between Rollerball and the original is a pair of 'Squeezer' enemies that move along the outlines of areas you have filled in.",
