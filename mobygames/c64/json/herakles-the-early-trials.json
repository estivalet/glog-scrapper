  "description": "Ancient Greece is no longer a nice place to live with wild beasts roaming the lands with supernatural powers and cities with Kings treating their subjects harshly. The people feel the Gods are ignoring their pleas no matter how much they prayer and offer sacrifices. Greece needs a hero and you take the role of one such potential hero. Your name is Herakles and you live in a small dwelling called Tiryns and you are descended from Perseus the Gorgon Slayer and fathered by Zeus himself. <br><br>Many years ago you were driven mad by the Goddess Hera and you ended up murdering you wife and children. You have finally accepted what has happened and you are ready to atone for your sins and to place yourself alongside the Gods and fulfill your destiny. The only way you can do this is to save the people of Greece by completing ten tasks set to you by the King Eurystheus in the city of Mycenae. You will face many creatures and evil as you attempt to save Greece and atone for your sins.<br><br><i>Herakles: The Early Trials</i> is a text adventure with the occasional graphics to show your surroundings. Text describes your surroundings and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with objects, people and creatures.",
