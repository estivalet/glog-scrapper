  "description": "This game shares two major similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Great+Escape\">The Great Escape</a> - firstly, it's licensed around a venerable film, using the setting to new effect. Secondly, it's isometrically-viewed (with monochrome graphics, even on the capable-of-far-better C64) and features full object interaction of the Filmation style - this is taken further here, as the physics of the objects are varied by their shape and centre of gravity.<br><br>There are three stages to complete. In the first you play Johnathan Harker, who must retrieve some papers (he works for an Estate Agent's) and escape the castle. The second level introduces Johnathan's wife Lucy, and van Helsing, with play switching between the three. Lucy's role is slightly different as it is she who pursues the vampire itself, and she takes on the task alone in level 3.<br><br>Food must be collected to keep the characters' strength up, and crucifixes and candles can be picked up to help matters.",
