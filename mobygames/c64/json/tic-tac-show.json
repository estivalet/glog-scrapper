  "description": "<i>Tic Tac Show</i> is a 2 - player trivia game for multiple systems.<br><br>Designed to play like a trivia game show, two human opponents or one human and one computer opponent can square off against each other.  Players take turns choosing a square on the board, and if they answer the question correctly, they get the spot.  If they answer incorrectly, their opponent gets the spot.  The first person to acquire 3-in-a-row wins the game.  If nobody gets 3-in-a-row, then the player who has the most spots wins.  There is a wild card spot hidden on each board, which does not require answering a question. Players can create their own trivia topics and questions, and add them to the game.  ",
