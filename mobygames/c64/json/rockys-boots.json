  "description": "<i>Rocky's Boots</i> is a simple educational puzzle game where you can learn about logic circuits.<br><br>You control a nondescript square, moving it about several rooms. Each room contains basic electronic parts like AND, OR and NOT gates, flip-flops, delays and clocks. You can pick these up and combine them to build simple or complex circuits. <br><br>After a helpful tutorial, the task in the game is to build &quot;kicking&quot; machines: Objects of different colors move through an area and turn sensor outputs on and off. You now have to build a circuit that activates a kicking device which kicks the right objects out. When you do it just right, Rocky the raccoon dances a little jig to a joyful melody for you!<br><br>The game also features an editor where you can build you very own kicking puzzle.\n",
