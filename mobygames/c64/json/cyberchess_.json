  "description": "<i>Cyberchess</i> is a 1-player chess teaching and playing tool based upon a mechanical chess playing machine.<br><br>Based upon a series of four previously played games between chess grandmasters, the player must set up their own chess board and follow along with these games.  Gameplay consists of multiple-choice questions, where the player tries to guess the move the grandmaster player made next.  If the player gets the move correct, they are rewarded with points.  If they guess incorrectly, they are docked points based upon how poor their move was in relation to the the grandmaster.  The score is followed through the game, with the player ultimately being rewarded a final score based upon their chess game.  ",
