  "description": "Take over the kingdom of <i>Darkhorn</i> in this early RTS tactical/strategic game. There are 4 sides battling to take command of Darkhorn - all can be played by human players, all giving orders simultaneously. You can be a dwarf, human or elf. <br><br>The land consists of nine different map regions, with different terrains suiting different sides. Once an overall winner is found, they must face the Final Trial to take overall control. Alternatively, you can play a quick battle on one of the sixteen provided maps, or generate one at random.<br><br>Choosing locations to occupy and when to fight is critical. Sword fighting is represented by a short action sequence.",
