  "description": "You control a witch who has the job of recovering four magic scrolls that were stolen from Neverland by Colo, the evil sorcerer, and his henchmen. You have four items to protect yourself - a Cape, a Cross, a Wand, and an Hour Glass - each one performing a different function and helping the witch to defeat the creatures that inhabit Colo's domain. <br><br>Each burrow is split into four different levels: Heaven, Forest, Caverns, and Ice, and each section is represented on screen as horizontally scrolling levels. Chests are encountered along the way, and they provide bonus points, extra time, magic weapons, and a balloon that takes the witch to the previous section. Somewhere within the burrow, the witch must find the guardian, Ant Eater, so that she can recover one of the scrolls and proceed to the next burrow.",
