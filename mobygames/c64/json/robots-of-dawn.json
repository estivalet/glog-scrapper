  "description": "In this text adventure based on Isaac Asimov's science fiction detective novel <i>The Robots of Dawn</i>, the player takes the role of Earth detective Elijah Baley, who is sent to the Spacer world of Aurora to investigate the murder of Dr. Han Falstofe, a prominent roboticist and constructor of humaniform robots. Suspects include Falstofe's political and professional rival Dr. Kelden Amadiro, his surrogate daughter Gladia, his biological daughter Vasilia, or ladies' man Gremionis, who was rejected by Gladia. Even Baley's robot friend and partner, R. Daneel Olivaw is not free of suspicion. In addition to the investigation, Baley must also deal with his fear of open spaces on Aurora, a result of having spent his entire life in enclosed spaces on the overcrowded Earth. Also, most Aurorans will not exactly be willing to help Baley due to anti-Earth sentiment.<br><br>As typical with adventure games in the detective genre, puzzles are less based on item manipulation but more on gathering evidence and questioning suspects. In each game played, the murderer might be a different one - the location of items and people's reaction to questions differ accordingly. To convict the killer, Baley must determine motive, means and opportunity and present his evidence to the Chairman of Aurora.",
