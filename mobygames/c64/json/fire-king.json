  "description": "The city of Stormhaven Bay was once enjoying prosperity, protected by the balance of four elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Each element had a mage that supervised and controlled it, preserving harmony in the land. But the Fire Mage, the leader of the group, was slain by a horrifying monster. This broke the balance, and monsters began to roam the land and attack townspeople. A brave hero is needed to defeat the fiends and restore peace!<br><br><i>Fire King</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/demon-stalkers\">Demon Stalkers</a>. Like its predecessor, it is essentially a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a> variant in its core. The player explores the top-down world, descending into dungeons and fighting hordes of enemies in fast-paced, action-oriented combat. Compared to its spiritual predecessors, <i>Fire King</i> incorporates more RPG elements.The player can choose to control one of the six available characters, and specialize in one of the three disciplines: Magic, Armor, and Strength. Spells and other helpful items can be found in the dungeons and used against the enemies.",
