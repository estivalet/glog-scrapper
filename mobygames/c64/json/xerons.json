  "description": "In 1997 at the World Peace Conference, the World President Eugene Minter declared that the Solar System was no longer in danger of attack by any alien invaders. In 1999 he was to be proved wrong as Moon Base Alpha is attacked by a huge battle fleet. You are the commander of the last Laser Blaster as you attempt to destroy wave after wave of attacks by the aliens before hopefully reinforcements arrive.<br><br><i>Xerons</i> is based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/galaxian\">Galaxian</a> as you control a Laser Blaster viewed from the side on the bottom of the screen with the alien invaders sat above you in formation. You must blast all the aliens with your laser but alien crafts will break from formation and move down the screen firing at you. If you are hit then you lose one of three lives. Once all alien crafts have been destroyed then you move to the next level. A joystick or keyboard are used to control your blaster.",
