  "description": "<i>Counter Attack</i> is inspired by the board game Connect 4 where two players take it in turns to place a counter in one of seven columns on an upright grid to make a row or force the other player to make a row vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Before the game starts there are two options that can be selected, how many counters to make a row, and if the winner is the first player to make the row or to force the other player to make one. As the game progresses placing counters, each player has a choice, either place a counter or rotate a row or column one place, left, right, up or down. ",
