For Windows the game is played on the VICE emulator. It contains the CRT and D64 files needed to run it and these can also be used separately to play the game on the original C64 hardware.<br><br>The game has the typical <i>Farming Simulator</i> gameplay here shown from an isometric perspective. There are three tractors and one harvester the player can control, based on the brands Case IH, Fendt, John Deere and New Holland. The game takes place on a single map. The different vehicles can be controlled and there are keys to quickly switch between them. Basic actions are acceleration, turning, breaking or reversing, and using the equipment.
