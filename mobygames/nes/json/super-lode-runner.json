  "description": "Between 1984 to 1986, <i>Irem</i> released four more different Lode Runner arcade games in Japan after the original arcade game's release. 55 stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into <i>Super Lode Runner</i> for the Famicom Disk System. The game also kept the innovation from the arcade games of the two-player mode and brought in 15 stages for simultaneous action.<br><br>The game keeps the typical gameplay of the Lode Runner series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.<br><br>A few months after this game was released, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Lode+Runner+II\">Super Lode Runner II</a> was released which is similar to this game, only it included different stages from the arcade games. Also, this game shouldn't be confused with the MSX game with the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/super-lode-runner_\">title</a>. While in a similar situation as this game, it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.",
