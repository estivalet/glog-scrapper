  "description": "<i>Cheril in the Cave</i> is a 2D platformer originally created in 2017 but released for the first time in 2020. Players control the character Cheril in a series of caves presented as fixed-screen environments linked together using the flip-screen mechanic. The game is slow and requires precise platform jumping to avoid hazards such as blades and slime, as well as enemies. There is some freedom to explore as often objects such as a floppy disk are needed to activate a terminal elsewhere and proceed. The character starts with five lives and every encounter immediately removes one. It is possible to jump on top of characters, but this will not kill them. Certain enemies such as bats can be killed by luring them into slime. The game starts with a short tutorial.",
