Each level contains hearts that Lolo must collect to open a chest and collect the key. Lolo must strategically move blocks and manipulate enemies to accomplish this feat. Many enemies wait until after the last heart is collected to spring to life, splitting the challenge between collecting all the hearts and then still getting the key.<br><br>New to this game is a map creation mode (hence the title, <i>Departure to Creation</i>) that allows players to design their own puzzles.
