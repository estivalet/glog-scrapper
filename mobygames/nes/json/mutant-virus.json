  "description": "In The Mutant Virus you play the part of Ron Trainer, the best of the best at the elite corps of Computer Master Debuggers. And just recently, something has gone terribly wrong. CPI, the Central Programming Institute, controls all the computers in the city which in turn control everything in the city itself. There are some bugs in this system and it's your job to get rid of them and find out how they got there. You will be miniaturized and sent into the computer with a vacine. Gameplay is from an overhead view where you will need to visit all the infected computer systems and use the vacine to contain the virus.",
