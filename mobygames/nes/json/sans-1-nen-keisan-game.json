  "description": "An educational game consisting of four different mini games. The minigames included are:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Addition 1</b> - Players control a car and have to drive it into the correct number to answer a math problem. Crashing into another car or answering the problem wrong will cost the player a try.<br><br><li><b>Subtraction 1</b> - Players control a rabbit and have to hop onto the correct number to answer a subtraction problem. Once they answered the problem they have to escape the garden without running into the worms that live there. Running into the worms or answering the question wrong will cost the player a try.<br><br><li><b>Addition 2</b> - Players control a dentist inside a very large mouth. Players have to drill the tooth that has the correct number on it that answers a math problem. Players have to avoid running into a cavity creature or drilling the wrong tooth by answering the question wrong, or else they will lose a try.<br><br><li><b>Subtraction 2</b> - Players have to fly the correctly numbered hot air balloon (the number that answers the math problem), into a frame carried by a bird at the top of the sky. Answering the problem wrong or crashing into another bird  will cost the player a try.\n</ul>\n</li>\nIn all the minigames, answering the math problems right will build up the players score. However if the player loses all five of their tries, their score will reset back to zero. Also, each minigame has two difficulty levels and also allows for two player alternating play.<br><br>",
