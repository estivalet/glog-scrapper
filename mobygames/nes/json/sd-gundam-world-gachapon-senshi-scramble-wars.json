  "description": "<i>SD Gundam World: Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars</i>, originally released in Japan on Famicom Disc System, is the first game in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=SD+Gundam+Gachapon+Senshi+series\">SD Gundam Gachapon Senshi series</a> that combine turn-based strategy with arcade action battles. The player commands SD Gundam army and the goal of each scenario is to either defeat all enemy units or occupy enemy capital. The player moves his battle units on strategic map in turn-based mode. Occupied cities and colonies provide funds for the construction of new units. When opposing battle units meet on a single square a real-time arcade-style battle begins in which the player directly controls a super-deformed mech and needs to defeat the enemy mech. There are several different battle fields; they are selected depending on the type of terrain on the strategic map where the units attacked each other. Ten different maps (scenarios) are available for single play or two-player versus play.  ",
