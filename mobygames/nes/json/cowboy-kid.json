  "description": "Villatown has been under siege by a local gang known as the Scorpions. A rumor began to spread that the gang was going to commit a train robbery so the town's sheriff went out to investigate and was never heard from again. Seeking vengeance, the sheriff's son named Sam went out to fight the Scorpions, but was ambushed by some of the gang and was almost killed. Sam was luckily saved by an Indian Warrior named Little Chief. After Little Chief seen Sam's courage, he vowed to help Sam bring the Scorpions to justice. Sam became the new Sheriff in town and chose Little Chief as his deputy.<br><br>In this game you play the role of Sheriff Sam, a young gunslinger who travels the land fighting baddies and playing mini games. The main game play involves you moving around the towns horizontally collecting gold by hitting chest whilst at the same time killing the bad guys before they kill you. There is also an RPG element to it where you have to visit people in the towns in order to proceed like at the very beginning where you need to first acquire a knife and you are then able to smash the chest and get money in order to buy a key which in turn allows you to enter the Sheriffs building. Once you are made sheriff you can go to various towns hunting down an outlaw for the bounty money. There are also mini-games such as the shooting range where you have to shoot the bad guy targets whilst avoiding shooting the innocent bystander targets.",
