  "description": "This basketball game is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tecmo-super-nba-basketball\">Tecmo Super NBA Basketball</a> with the main difference being their rosters. The game has 27 NBA teams with a roster of 324 Players. Each player has a rating for his shooting ability, stamina, jumping power, running speed, stealing ability, and blocking ability. The game allows for pre-season and season modes. In the season modes the game tracks team &amp; player statistics throughout the season.<br><br>You can choose between four modes of play: Manual, which enables you to control an individual team; Coach, which turns the play calling (but not the actual playing) over to you; Computer, which gives all the controls to the computer; and Skip, where the results of a computer-played game are posted, without the game ever having taken place. The game also allows you to set the quarter's time from two minutes to 12 minutes.",
