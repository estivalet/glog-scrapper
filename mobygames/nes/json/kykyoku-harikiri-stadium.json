  "description": "<i>Ky?kyoku Harikiri Stadium</i> is the first title in a whole series of baseball games from Taito. Players have the option between a 1-player game against the CPU or a 2-player game. They have the choice to pick a team from a pool of thirteen non-licensed teams. Each team has its own players with slightly different stats. The third and last mode is a special homerun race. The players compete to hit as many homeruns in a given number of tries.<br><br>The game itself follows the standard formula of nearly all baseball games of its time, with having a 3rd-person view from behind the batter or pitcher during the pitching/batting scenes and an overhead view of the field once the batter player hits the ball. After a successful 1-player match a password is given with the option to increase some of the player's stats.",
