You play the part of Shadax, who must now rescue the Princess by searching the fortress for the six pieces of the magical Staff of Demnos and use it to defeat Morbius. <br><br><i>Solstice</i> is a combination of puzzle-solving and action game played from an isometric 3D point of view. There are numerous rooms to explore in the fortress, many with dangerous, evil creatures wandering about and traps and obstacles to get past. Along the way there are magic potions, keys, and many other items to find which help you get past the creatures as well as reach new parts of the fortress.",
