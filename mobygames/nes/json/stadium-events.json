  "description": "<i>Stadium Events</i>, later re-released as <i>World Class Track Meet</i>,  is a track and field game for up to six players requiring the Power Pad. Only a maximum of  two players can play together on the pad at the same time. There are several events: 100m dash, long jump, 110m hurdles and the triple jump. When you beat the computer in the single player mode, you move on to a faster opponent. The AI opponents are (slowest to fastest): Turtle, Bear, Horse, Rabbit, Bobcat and Cheetah. With each defeated opponent, you earn a medal or a trophy - the harder the opponent, the better the award.<br><br>Olympics is a 1-6 player event in which you will do all four events in a row. At the end, the computer will show you a total score. There is one player at a time in the jumping events and two at the same time (for two or more human players) in running events.<br><br>",
