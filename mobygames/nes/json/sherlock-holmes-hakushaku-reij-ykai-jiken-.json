  "description": "The great detective Sherlock Holmes has another case to solve. This time the case involves trying to solve the mystery of the kidnapped countess.<br><br>Holmes has to travel all over Great Britain by train so he can find clues. He first searches the cities looking for locations he can investigate more thoroughly. Once he finds the locations, such as parks, sewers, or houses, the game switches to a side-scrolling action game. In these areas clues and items can be found either laying around or by interrogating hostile thugs. Dealing with the thugs will slowly build up a percentage that Holmes will have to get to one hundred percent in order to finish the game. In each city Holmes is looking for the main boss who when defeated gives out a password. This password then must be used at a gang hideout to complete a city's investigation. <br><br>Holmes can kick enemies (and also innocent citizens who happen to cough up some money when defeated) as a means of offense. He can also acquire weapons such as a knife or a gun as additional offensive options. Holmes can also collect several inventory items like a magnifying glass, a lamp, keys, and medicine bottles to assist him along the way. Holmes has to be careful not to fall into a pit, be shot or even be touched too many times, or else this case will remain forever unsolved.",
