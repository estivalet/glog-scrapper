  "description": "<i>Thunderbolt 2</i> is a vertically-scrolling top-down shooter set in space. The introduction shows how Earth is attacked from outer space. The player controls a space ship through three levels, each one with a boss. The ship can be freely moved around the screen and it has an unlimited amount of bullets. The ship has three lives but additional ones can be earned by destroying enemies. Destroyed opponents leave behind power-ups that provide weapon upgrades with new bullets patterns as well as bomb icons that clear the entire screen right away when they are picked up. Enemies typically appear in waves with different patterns.",
