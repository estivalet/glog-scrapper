  "description": "<em>Fisher-Price: Perfect Fit</em> is an activity that drops shapes onto the screen (usually in the form of Fisher-Price toys) which the player must then manipulate and match onto one of a series of silhouettes. In earlier levels, this is just a matter of moving the shape around the screen. In later levels, the player must also flip the shape vertically, horizontally, or both, before it forms the perfect fit for one of the silhouettes. The games can be played against the clock. There is also 2-player alternating play, where 2 human players can compete, or a human player can square off against the computer player (named &quot;Electro&quot;).",
