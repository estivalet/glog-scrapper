  "description": "<i>The Black Bass</i> is a simple fishing game. Players first choose from a few different lures. Then players have to cast the lures into the water using a meter to gauge the distance their fishing line is cast. Finally, players are presented a side view of the bottom of a lake. Players can move the lure back and forth to attract a bass to take a bite. If the bass falls for the bait and gets caught on the fishing hook, the player has to slowly and carefully reel in the fish. If the player is to careless reeling in a fish, the line can snap and cost the player a lure and the fish.",
