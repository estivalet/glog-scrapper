  "description": "In the space year of 2999,  the powerful Bismark Empire has decided to launch an attack on the planet Earth. First however, they must occupy a small planet named Star Lenion so they can use it as a launching point for their main attack on the planet Earth. So far on Star Lenion, the Bismark Empire has built a base and are in the process of building a powerful super weapon called the Baltron. The Earth Defense troops have to destroy this base before the Baltron weapon becomes fully functional.<br><br>In this game that is a scrolling horizontal shooter similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Defender\">Defender</a>, players take control of the fastest Earth starship called the Gistorias. Gistorias can attack enemies with its laser and air-to-ground bombs. Gistorias can also unleash a flash smart bomb clearing the screen of enemies. Gistorias can move both right and left, change speed from slow to fast, and can also use a warp boost to try and escape from perilous situations.<br><br>Players also have to monitor Gistorias fuel gauge and make sure it doesn't get to low. Fuel itself can be replenished by picking up fuel containers.\n",
