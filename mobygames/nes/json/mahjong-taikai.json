  "description": "<i>Mahjong Taikai</i> is a mahjong game in which the player competes against famous historical characters. Most of the opponents are famous warlords such as Julius Caesar, Zhuge Liang, Genghis Khan, Oda Nobunaga, Napoleon, and others. Famous women of the past such as Cleopatra and Yang Guifei are selectable as well. The player chooses three opponents and challenges them to a game of four-player mahjong. Various mahjong rules can be changed to reflect regional differences. Once the player has sufficiently advanced in the rankings a grand tournament mode opens up.",
