  "description": "One day Kirby is surprised to discover that he cannot have any dreams during his customary after-lunch nap. Soon he discovers that King Dedede has stolen the Star Rod, which supplies the energy to the Fountain of Dreams, and broken it into several pieces, entrusting each of his allies with one. Kirby has no other choice but find these pieces and bring dreams back to the Dream Land.<br><br><i>Kirby's Adventure</i> is an action side-scrolling platform game. As the pink puffball Kirby the player explores numerous colorful lands with a variety of enemies to defeat. To help out on his journey, Kirby has the ability to eat enemies and spit them out as projectiles. With certain enemies Kirby can capture their abilities and e.g. gain a sword, shoot lasers, or even fly around the level. There are seven different stages, each broken up into multiple levels, and sometimes also containing a couple of bonus mini-games. The game cartridge features a battery backup allowing games to be saved without the need for passwords. ",
