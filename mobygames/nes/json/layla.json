  "description": "LayLa is on a mission to rescue her friend Iris from an evil doctor who has kidnapped her. This mission will take LayLa through eight different explorable asteroids.<br><br>Gameplay mainly involves controlling LayLa through the cavernous maze-like asteroids shooting at the enemies who get in her way. Also of utmost importance is the collection of password disks that are found in each asteroid (they are needed in order to beat the game). Each asteroid contains several elevators that take LayLa to the different areas of the asteroid she is currently in. At the end of each asteroid is a boss monster that LayLa must defeat in order to leave the asteroid.<br><br>LayLa can find several items and weapons in each asteroid. Weapons include things such things as handguns, machine guns, and hand grenades, while usable items include things such as roller skates and a barrier.<br><br>After completing each asteroid level there is a bonus stage involving LayLa flying in her ship on her way to the next asteroid.  The bonus stage is a horizontal side-scrolling shoot-'em-up that is viewed from the side. Destroying an entire squadron of enemies will earn the player bonus points. LayLa can't get hurt during this portion of the game. Bonus rounds are only used to enable the player to increase their score.<br><br>",
