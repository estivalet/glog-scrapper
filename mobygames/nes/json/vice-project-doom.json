  "description": "Quinn Hart and his partner, Detective Reese of the VICE squad both work to stop the trafficking of illegal substances. But something new has appeared on the scene, a neon gel with great addictive properties. During investigations as to the origin of the gel, Reese mysteriously disappears and leaves Hart without a lead. Time passes and Hart becomes romantically involved with his new partner, Christy, as he continues trying to track down the gel. But Hart is about to get a brand new lead...<br><br><i>Vice: Project Doom</i> is a game that features side-scrolling platform sequences, overhead driving modes and rail-shooter stages. In driving stages Hart's vehicle can accelerate or slow down and fire his weapon straight ahead. During side-scrolling sequences, Hart can jump, duck, climb or use his selected weapon. Weapons that can be selected include a Katana sword, a pistol and a grenade-type weapon. These weapons feature limited ammunition with the exception of the katana. Power-ups include ammunition, coins, and health. In rail-shooting stages, similar to  <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a>, Hart can shoot enemies with his gun or throw grenades and pick up items by shooting at them.<br><br>During these sequences, Hart must fight and maneuver his way past enemy foes to confront a boss. By destroying the boss and completing the level, Hart progresses and learns a bit more about the origins of the neon gel and what Project Doom is all about. Cinematics dialog between the levels tell the tale in a style similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ninja+Gaiden\">Ninja Gaiden</a>.",
