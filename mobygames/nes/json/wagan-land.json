  "description": "In <i>Wagan Land</i>, you control a green mechanical dinosaur named Wagan who has the ability to temporarily stun enemies with sound waves. The waves are shaped like the noises &quot;Wah&quot; (??) and &quot;Gah&quot; (???). The mad scientist Dr. Devil is trying to take over Wagan Land, and Wagan wants to protect his home. There are power-ups called Waganizers, which make Wagan's sound waves more powerful, stunning the enemies for a longer amount of time. If four Waganizers are collected, Wagan becomes temporarily invincible, faster and actually able to defeat enemies. At the end of certain stages is a boss. Each boss challenges Wagan to a mini-game instead of a battle.",
