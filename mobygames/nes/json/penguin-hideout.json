  "description": "<i>Penguin &amp; Seal</i> is an arcade action game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pengo\">Pengo</a>. The player controls a penguin who must gather gems and deposit them into an igloo while avoiding becoming lunch for the seals wandering nearby. Each stage is filled with blocks, most of which can be destroyed, as well as three gems. The goal is to push the blocks to destroy them and crush the seals, while gathering the gems and depositing them in the igloo on the right side of the screen. Contact with either a seal or a kicked block will kill the penguin instantly. Successfully deposit all three gems to move on to the next stage.<br><br>The NES version also includes a 2-player mode and a puzzle construction mode.",
