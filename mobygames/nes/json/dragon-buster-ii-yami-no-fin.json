  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dragon-buster\">Dragon Buster</a> has the following background story: the young archer Carl has to retrieve an ancient artifact in order to liberate the world from the domination of demons and dragons. <br><br>Unlike the first game, the player character is not restricted to a platform here, but can move freely in any direction. Carl moves through maze-like dungeons, finds keys, and then gets to the exit. After that, the dungeon disappears and makes it possible for the player to advance to the next one. Carl fights enemies with a bow; there is a limited supply of arrows, but it is possible to find quivers among other items in the dungeons.",
