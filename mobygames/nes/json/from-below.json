And it just might be enough to slow it down till morning, when surely help will arrive...<br><br>---<br><br>FROM BELOW is a falling block puzzle game featuring:<br><br>Soft Drops<br>\nHard Drops<br>\nWall Kicks<br>\nT-Spins<br>\nLock Delay<br>\n3 modes of play:<br>\nKraken Battle Mode<br><br>The signature mode of FROM BELOW. Battle the Kraken by clear lines across the onslaught of attacking Kraken Tentacles. The Tentacles push more blocks onto the screen every few seconds, forcing to act quickly, and strategize on an every changing board.<br><br>Classic Mode<br><br>The classic block falling mechanics you know and love without any new gimmicks. Modernize for 2020, with Hard Drops, Lock Delay, and more, making this (hopefully) the best feeling puzzle game on the NES!<br><br>Turn Based Kraken Battle Mode<br><br>Similar to &quot;Kraken Battle Mode&quot;, but instead of the Kraken attacking every few seconds, it advances its tentacle every time you drop a piece. Make every move count, as this move favors slow, deliberate play!",
