  "description": "In the 22nd century, the conquest of space by the human race has progressed with great momentum. The moon has become inhabitable, and a space development colony has been established on Pluto's Lagrange Point. It is the hope of humanity, with the help of its under-development Hyperzone Drive, that this colony will be the beginning of the further exploration of the universe.<br><br>But, little did they know, that aliens from a far-off corner of the galaxy have different ideas, invading planets left and right and scheming about one day ruling all of outer space. Their ease in conquering planets is such, you'd think they were treating it as just another day at the office.<br><br>One day, the humans' little colony on Pluto felt the wrath of the aliens, and in a matter of minutes their giant warship Gigantos had the poor little inhabitants at their mercy. But it wasn't enough to just conquer the Plutonian colony - they wanted more, and so their sights set on Earth. Faced with utter destruction of their planet, America's newly-formed Space Force was injected with Hyperzone Drive and were sent on their way. But, only one ship knows well enough to control a Hyperzone-fueled craft. Its name - Falsion.<br><br>As Falsion, you're mankind's last hope against the invading forces of the aliens. Armed with a beam weapon plus an expendable amount of homing missiles, your job is to blast through 6 first-person levels of standard-fare enemies and their huge leaders. Along the way, you'll find red (to increase your missile supply) and blue (to speed you up) capsules. And the action can only get more intense in the 3D mode, as enemies will seem to leap out of the TV screen and towards you.",
