  "description": "<i>Takeshi no Ch?senj?</i> is a game based on the ideas and bearing of the name of Japanese comedian <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Takeshi+Kitano\">Takeshi Kitano</a>.<br><br>The player takes control of a regular office worker who finds out that there is a treasure hidden somewhere on an island. The game world consists mostly of urban areas and is viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The protagonist can jump and punch any character he encounters, even including the old man at the password screen (which results in a game over). The player character's health is measured in hearts. Hostile characters may attack him, but most of the people on the streets and indoor locations are harmless.<br><br>Besides exploring locations, the game includes other activities, such as obtaining a divorce from the protagonist's wife, completing a side-scrolling shooting sequence with a hang glider, and using a microphone built into the Famicom's second controller to perform a karaoke song.",
