  "description": "<i>Marusa no Onna</i> is an adventure game based on the 1987 film of the same name (which was released in English as A Taxing Woman). Following the film's plot, players control a tax auditor named Ry?ko Itakura who travels the city to uncover tax evasion and fraud. The action plays mostly like a visual novel and done by selecting various actions from the on-screen menu. The main exception is an overhead exploration mode where players can move through the streets in order to enter buildings. Players can also receive a password from their home office in order to save their progress.",
