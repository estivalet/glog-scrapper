  "description": "Honey Bunny has been taken captive and Bugs Bunny is off to rescue her. Bugs has to contend with those rascals Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Wiley Coyote, and Yosemite Sam who intend to stop him from completing this task.<br><br>The game consists of sixty levels. Bugs must collect all the carrots on a level to beat it. This is not as straight forward as it seems as levels are typically maze like with many stairs and pipes that have to be navigated for Bugs to find all the carrots. Also, while Bugs is trying to find his way he'll have enemies constantly chasing him. He can deal with these enemies by pushing heavy objects on top of them or find boxing gloves that let him punch his adversaries. Bugs can also find an item called Magic Carrot Juice which gives him temporary invincibility.<br><br>This version should not be confused with the same titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/bugs-bunny-crazy-castle\">Game Boy version</a> which has its own unique level layouts.",
