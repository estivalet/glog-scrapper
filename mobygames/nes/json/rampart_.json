  "description": "In this Famicom version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/rampart\">arcade hit</a>, you are faced with with 4 different scenarios (of increasing difficulty) and more depth than the original game. <br><br>But the basic elements of <i>Rampart</i> are still there: first you build a castle from Tetris-esque pieces. Next you place a series of cannons and use them to bomb the enemy. Then you repair any damage the enemy inflicted on your fort, and do it all over again. <br><br>When you reach a certain number of points, the scenario is cleared and you can pick another one.",
