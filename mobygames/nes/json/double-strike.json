  "description": "The South Pacific contains some of the most beautiful islands in the world, and they have all been invaded by a terrorist organization called DAMED (Destructive Armed Militant Enemy Devotee). You must fly an experimental fighter jet called the Thrasher Hawk-7 to battle the enemy and rid them from nine different islands. To help out, six different power ups can be collected after destroying certain enemies which provide better weapons, bombs, or extra lives.",
