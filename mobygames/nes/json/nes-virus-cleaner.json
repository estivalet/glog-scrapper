  "description": "<i>NES Virus Cleaner</i> is a homebrew arcade game and a spoof of the NES Cleaning Kit. Players guide the hero Clik through the inside of a NES console to grab the viruses that appear in various locations on the screen. Each level consists of a single, fixed screen and Clik can be moved around freely. To complete the level and move on to the next one, a certain number of viruses need to be captured before time runs out.<br><br>Clik is slowed down in his movement especially because of electric bolts, sparks, homing missiles and disappearing blocks in the environment. Clik has no means to attack and can only move, so a lot of evasion is required. When the character is hit it respawns in the location where the last virus was captured. To help Clik get around fast when almost out of time he can drop a teleporter at any location to quickly shift to that place, but at the cost of 1,000 points. Once deployed it is possible to cancel the teleporter to drop it in a new location.<br><br>Each level is built around a component of the NES console with a brief introduction by Clik as a guide. The character also explains all the dangers in that level. Points are scored for every captured virus (50 points), but they also provide additional time. If Clik gets hit a life is lost as well as 100 points.",
