It is the brother game of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/aussie-rules-footy\">Aussie Rules Footy</a>. The player can choose from eight teams; Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and West Indies. Additionally there is a hidden team called The Beam Team, where each of the developers' portraits is represented by Sonic the Hedgehog. From the menu there are different types of play modes the player can choose from.<br><br>Fast Game will start a game and randomly pick a team for the player and the computer. Single Match is a regular exhibition game in which the player chooses their team as well as the computer's team. The World Series is the main part of the game, where the player will select a team and will then go up against the other seven teams. The player can also choose the color of their team. There is also a practice mode where the player can practice batting or bowling. There is also an options screen where the player can set the number of overs, enable or disable the bowl screen, turn music on or off, enable or disable the bounce cross, as well as computer aided selections.<br><br>Before the game, the player must do a coin toss to see who will bat first, as well as where to place their teammates. In the batting screen, the game is seen from a 3rd-person view, but after the ball is hit, the game switches to a birds-eye view. Whenever a certain event occurs, a cutscene is played to represent the said event, such as Howzats, Out for a Duck, and Bowled Him.<br><br>The game would later see a port on the SNES (titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-international-cricket\">Super International Cricket</a>) with altered gameplay.",
