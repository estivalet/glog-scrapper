  "shortName": "dragon-ball-z-ii-gekigami-freezer",
  "description": "The second in the Dragon Ball Z RPG series, &quot;Freezer the Planet Destroyer&quot;, as it is often unofficially translated, follows closely the popular manga series and continues the story of the first Dragon Ball Z RPG, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Saiyajin\"> Assault of Saiyajins</a>. After the fight against the Saiyajin leader Vegeta, Son Goku, the series' main hero, is heavily wounded, while his ally Piccolo is dead. Son Goku's son Son Gohan and his friends go to the planet Namek to find the magical Dragon Balls that would bring Piccolo back to life. The trouble is, Vegeta is heading to the planet, and so does the evil Freezer, who is also after the Dragon Balls...<br><br>You control both Son Gohan's and Son Goku's parties, including popular characters like Krillin, Yamcha, and others. The gameplay is pretty much the same as in the first game. Locations are composed of squares, and you move through them in a board-game-like fashion, drawing cards that will determine the amount of moves you can make. Random cards will also make you participate in battles, heal your party, add extra cards, etc. In battles you also depend on cards - your choice determines the strength of the move and the outcome of the automatic battle.",
