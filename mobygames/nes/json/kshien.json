  "description": "<i>K?shien</i> is a baseball game that focuses on the Japanese high school tournament. Two players can compete in a versus mode, each representing a high school team from various cities in Japan. In the tournament mode, the player competes against AI-controlled teams according to the competition schedule. Games between AI-controlled opponents can be viewed fully, or appear only as results. Substitutions can be made before a game begins, but there is no other team management. Pitchers and batters are controlled from a third-person perspective. Teams can be compared to each either statistics-wise, and their names can be changed.",
