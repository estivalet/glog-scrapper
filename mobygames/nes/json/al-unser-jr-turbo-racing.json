  "description": "Unlike its namesake, the IndyCar racer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,355425/\"> Al Unser Jr.</a>, this game depicts Formula 1 races. A season consists of sixteen races, each one consisting of unlimited practice, one qualifying lap and the real race (the starting position depends on the qualifying result). Of course the goal is to win the championship by having successful race results. Those results also change the amount of &quot;set-up points&quot;, which represent the quality of the car, players can use before the next race. Besides the championship there is also a time trial mode available (with or without AI opponents).<br><br>While the game features manual gear switching, it tends more to an action oriented gameplay than a simulation: pit stops (needed when the car gets nearly destroyed after accidents) stop the time for every driver and players can use a limited amount of turbo boosts. Players can start their own racing team or play as Al Unser Jr., which results in always having the best car possible.",
