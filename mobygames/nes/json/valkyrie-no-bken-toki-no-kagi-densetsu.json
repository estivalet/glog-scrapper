  "description": "Once upon a time, the Marvel Land was a peaceful place populated by humans and other races. Zouna, a dark wizard who had once threatened the land was securely sealed in a clock tower. One day, the clock stopped working for unknown reason, and a villager who tried to fix it inadvertently dropped the key of time. A catastrophe ensued: Zouna broke free and took the key with him, preventing anyone from sealing him again. The dark minions of Zouna corrupted the hearts of Marvel Land inhabitants. Hatred and chaos descended upon the world. Finally, a savior has arrived - Valkyrie, a maiden from heaven vows to save Marvel Land from evil and defeat Zouna. <br><br><i>Valkyrie no B?ken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu</i> is an action role-playing game. Controlling Valkyrie, the player roams top-down wilderness areas, fighting enemies and collecting gold and experience points, which will eventually cause the heroine to level up and become stronger. Weapons and armor can be purchased in friendly areas or found during exploration. Valkyrie also gains access to seven different spells of offensive and healing nature. The time needed to learn the spell depends on the protagonist's intelligence parameter. The player's initial choice of star sign and blood group for the heroine may affect the changes in her statistics when she levels up.",
