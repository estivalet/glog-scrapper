  "description": "Eden is once again in chaos! Dark clouds cover the land, and monsters are sprouting up like nobody's business. The cause of all this is King Egger, who holds Princess Lala, the red bride-to-be of a ball-like creature named Lolo, hostage in a labyrinth of over 100 head-scratching rooms. It's up to Lolo to solve the devious rooms, defeat King Egger, and get his future wife back.<br><br>In this port of the MSX game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/eggerland-2\">Eggerland 2</a>, Lolo's objective is to get through 122 rooms (22 more than the original), collecting all the Heart Framers in each and grabbing the Jewel that will open the doors to Lolo's next challenge. But it won't be easy, because there are many hindrances in Lolo's way. Lolo can get bit by a plethora of enemies, fail to get through terrain like water and sand, run out of time while trying to collect keys (which he needs to save Lala), or simply get stuck and have no other choice but to give up. Fortunately, Lolo does have an advantage - certain Heart Framers, when obtained, will give him a magic shot which can trap enemies in eggs, which Lolo can then use as platforms. Certain enemies, however, cannot be trapped in eggs and must be blocked by other eggs or the box-like Emerald Framers.<br><br>The game is finished when Lolo has beaten King Egger and recovered Lala.",
