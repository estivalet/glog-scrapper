  "description": "<i>Espitene</i> is a 2D platformer inspired by the 2D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> games created for the 2018 NESdev competition. As a fangame it uses many familiar elements in both visuals and mechanics. Some of the levels were previously featured in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mojon-twins-gran-sabidura-31-in-1-real-games\">Mojon Twins Gran Sabiduría: 31 in 1 Real Games</a> for the six games based on <i>Sonic</i> as the parodies <i>Sonic Mal</i> and the variants with a female character <i>Espinette</i>. This release is much more fleshed out compared to the shorter versions released previously. It contains twelve full stages divided over different zones as well as six boss stages.<br><br>The story frames the game as part of the <i>Cheril</i> series. The recurring character in many of the developer's games find a mysterious puppet. When she examines it she knows she has a mission. She dresses up as the puppet wearing it as a costume and that way she becomes Espinette who needs to defeat the evil Somari (a spoof of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Mario\">Mario</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/somari-the-adventurer\">Somari the Adventurer</a>, replacing Robotnik as the boss) and finds the six emeralds of Podewwwr.<br><br>The player guides Espinette through levels with platform elements. The environment consists of single-screen rooms usually connected horizontally, but sometimes also vertically, using the flip-screen mechanic, offering an amount of freedom to explore. Typical challenges include crossing gaps, avoiding spikes, defeating enemies by jumping into them while spinning, using launchers, moving platforms, disappearing platforms and so on. Espinette can collect rings and when she is hit a single ring remains. When it is picked up again quickly Espinette regains protection against another hit. This can be repeated indefinitely. Sometimes additional lives can be found as well. The height of the jump depends on how long the button is pressed. When jumping in a regular way, without spinning, Espinette is vulnerable and cannot take out enemies, just like Sonic.",
