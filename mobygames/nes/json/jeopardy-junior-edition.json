  "description": "A conversion of the popular TV game show for younger players ages 7 and up.<br><br>Up to three players can take part in the three-round trivia contest where the answers are given and the contestants must supply the correct question.<br><br>In the first two rounds, six categories of five answers each are randomly chosen by the computer to fill the &quot;wall&quot; and the player begins by choosing any one of them.  After the chosen answer is given, the first player to hit his &quot;buzzer&quot; gives the response using the controller to move a cursor over an onscreen keyboard, spelling out the question within the time limit.  In the final round, a category is announced and the players each place a bet, up to the limit of their winnings so far, on the final question.  After all players are ready, the final answer is shown and all players give their questions.<br><br>There are three difficulty levels and the computer can supply opponents if desired.",
