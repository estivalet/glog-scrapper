  "description": "Parsley Castle, an outer space kingdom, has been invaded! And strange beings are to blame. Playing as Rickle, a cyborg built by Dr. Cinnamon from Konami's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Twinbee\">Twinbee</a> series, and several of his friends from other (mostly Japan-only) Konami games, your objective is to save Parsley Castle and once again bring peace to Konami World.<br><br>At the start of the game, the player can choose 3 characters that accompany Rickle on his journey. Those characters will appear in a cute super-deformed style. <br><br>During the game, once the first level has been completed, the player(s) will then traverse several levels inspired by the games the characters are from, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Castlevania\">Castlevania</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Contra\">Contra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a>, and more. In addition, various mini-games will play from time to time (including one inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Frogger\">Frogger</a>, Konami's first major arcade hit).<br><br>In addition to Rickle, players can choose between Simon Belmont of &quot;Castlevania&quot; (a holdover from the first game), Bill of &quot;Contra&quot;, Fuuma from the Japanese title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/getsufma-den\">Getsuf?ma Den</a>, Goemon of his self-titled series (best known to Americans as Kid Ying from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/legend-of-the-mystical-ninja\">The Legend Of The Mystical Ninja</a>), and Upa from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bio-miracle-bokutte-upa\">Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa</a>, another Japan-only title. The player switches between the characters he/she has selected by obtaining pods that fly similar to the power-up pods in the &quot;Contra&quot; series. Rickle will then become one of those characters for 60 seconds (decreasing with damage).<br><br>In addition, like the last <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Wai+Wai+World\">Wai Wai World</a> game, two players can team up to save Parsley Castle together.",
