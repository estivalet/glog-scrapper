  "description": "In this game, you play the role of a little boy who is given a very important assignment by a wise magician. According to an ancient Jewish prophecy (says the magician), the world will become a better place if mankind establishes contact with demons. You are to study the art of summoning and to fulfill the prophecy. Your first quest is to locate Cerberus, the watch dog of hell.<br><br><i>Akuma-kun: Makai no Wana</i> is a RPG with turn-based combat. You travel on the world map and visit towns, where the perspective changes to side-scrolling. The unusual feature of the game is the ability to summon demonic creatures to your party and make them fight by your side, somewhat similarly to the system employed in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Megaten\">Megaten</a> games.",
