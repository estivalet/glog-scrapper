  "description": "Players take on the role of a walking tomato called Tomatobowerman and get to kick their way to victory against Girabir and his insect army. Rescue Princess Niketa and save the land of Vegitafruit from this insect invasion.<br><br><i>Kick Challenger</i> utilizes a novel movement system. Each foot must be maneuvered and placed, one foot at a time, in a system that mimics actual upright walking. Kicks can be fired off in eight directions using whichever foot isn't currently planted. Levels are tailored specifically for this movement style, and simulate hills, narrow pipes, and other hazards that require you to be mindful of where you're planting those tootsies.<br><br>Power-ups can be found by kicking the various fauna and bric-a-brac that fill the game's levels. These take the form of shoes that increase the tomato's stride or allow the player to walk on certain surfaces, or various items that give the player temporary abilities. Levels follow a linear upwards progression with no way to retreat backwards except by going through trap doors. In order to progress, the player must find their way through the maze-like levels and defeat the boss waiting at the end of them.",
