  "description": "<i>Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87</i> is very similar to its predecessor <i>Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium</i> aka <i>R.B.I. Baseball</i>. Nothing changed in regards of gameplay, graphics or music. The only change are more teams (twelve instead of ten) and updated team rosters and stats. As before you can choose between a 1-player or 2-player game or watch two computer teams play against each other. ",
