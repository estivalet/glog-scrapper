  "description": "<i>Sanma no Meitantei</i> (or, <i>Sanma the Great Detective</i>) casts the player as the assistant to the famous Japanese comedian and television personality Sanma Akashiya (who for the purposes of this game is apparently also a renowned private detective).  A party at the villa of a wealthy company president is marred by the death of a guest and the disappearance of a priceless diamond, the Star of Africa, and Sanma is called on to investigate.  As the plot progresses, the player opens up various locations around Osaka, where the player encounters a seemingly endless stream of suspicious characters - most of whom just happen to be other well known real-life comedians (all of whom worked for the same studio as Sanma at that time).<br><br>Gameplay follows the standard adventure game first-person  menu driven model (Look, Examine, Take, Use, etc.). There is also a pointer to examine specific points of interest, and a third-person map used to move between locations.  The game features various action-oriented minigames which must be passed to advance the plot, most notably a parody of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Namco+Limited\">Namco's</a> own <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Galaxian\">Galaxian</a></i>.",
