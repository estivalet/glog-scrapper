  "description": "<i>Last Action Hero</i> for the NES adapts the 1993 Schwarzenegger film as a side-scrolling action title.<br><br>Players control action hero Jack Slater through 8 stages. There are two main varieties of level, outdoors and indoors. All levels throw hordes of goons at Jack that respawn endlessly. He can defeat them by punching and kicking or simply evade them by jumping over them and continuing on his way. In outdoors levels, more enemies will usually be part of the background, like cops shooting their guns or homeless persons in trash cans throwing grenades. The indoors levels take place over several floors that Slater can move between by going through doorways. He also must sometimes punch in a door to continue. Most levels include several boss fights against major and minor enemies.<br><br>The levels are all based on the film and include Slater's confrontation with the Ripper, Slater's home, and the film premiere. There is even a stage based on the film's dream sequence starring Slater as Hamlet (&quot;Hey Claudius, you killed my father. Big mistake!&quot;), complete with archers and knights as enemies.<br><br>Small scenes between levels tell the story, some of which feature digitized images from the film.",
