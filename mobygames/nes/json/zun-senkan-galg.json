  "description": "The Zystasians are at war with Dragg and his forces and need help from the artificial intelligence battleship Galg. The player is given the mission to collect 100 enemy parts in order to have a final showdown with Dragg.<br><br>The game is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players ship can fire bullets at any incoming enemy forces while searching each area for an enemy part. The game contains 30 areas with three different themes in total (a river, a military base, and outer space) and some areas contain branching paths. Some areas also contain a Zystas Warp, which will take the player back to the beginning section of the next area. After finishing area 30, the game loops back to Area 1 until the player enters Area 30 with the 100 enemy parts collected.<br><br>The ship's power-ups include a faster firing rate, side cannons, and longer shots. Other items that can be found can grant the player 10 extra parts, a missile that can be fired to clear the entire screen of enemies, and also an item that can cause the player to lose all the parts they collected if they accidentally destroy it.<br><br>Players start with three lives and can earn extra lives by racking up enough points (first 20,000 points, then every 50,000 additional points thereafter).",
