Kirk, a worker for the Earth federation's space development office, heads out to work on building some new space colonies, leaving behind his girlfriend Mary. After a couple months on the job, Kirk, and his robotic sidekick Carry, are able to head back home so they can meet up with Mary. While trying to head home however, Kirk is struck by a ray of light knocking him unconscious. When he awakes he is in some underground facility. Now Kirk must make his way out safely, so he can rejoin back with his girlfriend Mary.<br><br>This is an adventure game. Players wander around the facility solving puzzles in order to advance to the next area. Solving puzzles involves selecting the appropriate command at the appropriate time. Commands include moving, seeing, inspecting, taking, setting, dropping, inserting, opening, exchanging, and also communicating with the robot sidekick Carry.",
