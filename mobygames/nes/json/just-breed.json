  "description": "The town of Astholm is protected by a Sapphire, one of the magical stones mentioned in old legends. Generation of honorable priestesses protect the stone, and with it the town. Tonight is the annual Sapphire Festival, and the young priestess Firis is going to conduct the ceremony. But just after the joyous event, the priestess is kidnapped by Gel du Rey, the henchman of the evil Lord Ezelkiel. You play the role of the captain of Astholm's guards. You and Firis have been close friends ever since the childhood. You decide to rescue the priestess, with the help of your loyal guards and friends you meet on your journey.<br><br><i>Just Breed</i> is a hybrid of traditional Japanese-style RPG like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dragon+Warrior\">Dragon Warrior</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/final-fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a>, and strategy. During confrontations with the enemies, the battle screen occupies the entire location, and large parties of allies and enemies fight each other in turn-based style, moving on the field to perform physical attacks (melee as well as ranged) or to cast magic spells.",
