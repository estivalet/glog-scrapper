  "description": "<i>Rad Racer II</i> is an arcade style racing game which is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rad-racer\">Rad Racer</a> and features similar gameplay. Played with a 3D perspective from behind your vehicle, the goal is to race through a series of different tracks before time runs out. Along each track are several checkpoints; crossing a checkpoint will increase the amount of time you have to reach the final destination. Eight new tracks are featured (with new graphics and music), each with a variety of hills, turns, obstacles, and other cars to get in your way. Crashing into other cars or any obstacles on the side of the road cause you to slow down or come to a stop and lose valuable time. Also new is a turbo boost which allows you to reach speeds of 255 mph. Unlike the original game, you now only have a choice of one car and the red-blue 3D glasses aren't supported.",
