  "description": "The twin brothers, Tatsuya and Kazuya Uesugi and their neighbor Minami Asakura get sucked into a alternate dimension while chasing after the twins dog, Punch. Now they have to find a way to return back to their normal home world.<br><br><i>City Adventure Touch: Mystery of Triangle</i> is a beat-'em-up. Players take control of the twin brothers (players can switch back and forth between each brother in the one player game) and explore the maze-like city, trying to locate and collect ten puppies. Several enemies roam the streets and the twins can throw punches or even baseballs at them in order to defend themselves. Defeating enemies increases the twins energy counter. Their energy also acts as a currency. They can and must spend their energy on certain items they find at shops. Only certain items can be used to beat the boss monsters who are holding the puppies captive. The twins will also need to locate certain shops to discard of items they no longer need as they each can only carry a handful of items at a time.\n",
