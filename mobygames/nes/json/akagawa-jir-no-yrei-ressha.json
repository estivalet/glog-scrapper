  "description": "The game is based on the detective story <i>Ghost Train</i>, the first one written by the popular Japanese author <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,630169/\">Jir? Akagawa</a>. You play a young detective who investigates a strange case: eight people have disappeared, and rumors are heard about a mysterious Ghost Train. You head to a remote village to learn more about those events. In this adventure game, you can move your hero from third-person perspective, but you can leave a screen only via a menu command. The menu is unique to each location; in some of them, you'll be able to investigate a room by moving around a cursor and clicking on objects, while in others you'll talk to people about various topics.",
