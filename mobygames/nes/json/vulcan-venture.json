  "description": "<i>Gradius II</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/life-force\">Life Force</a>, and is a horizontal space shooter composed of seven levels.\nLike in its predecessor, it is possible to collect power-ups from enemies and choose which type to use and when. This time, this system is enhanced with the option of choosing between four different power-up sequences, allowing the player to use different types of weapons against enemies. There is also the possibility to gain options, which are mysterious balls of fire that follows the player-controlled spaceship closely and mimic all its movements (including shots). While the player only could have two of them in the NES version of <i>Gradius</i>, it is now possible in all versions to have up to four.",
