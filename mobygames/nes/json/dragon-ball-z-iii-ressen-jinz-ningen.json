  "description": "&quot;Hot Battle: The Androids&quot; (the game's unofficial English title) is a direct sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=gekigami\"> second</a> RPG of the Dragon Ball Z series. Following the events depicted in the manga series those games are based on, &quot;Hot Battle&quot; picks up the story right where it ended in the previous game: in the ultimate battle, Son Goku defeated Freezer, the evil Planet Destroyer. However, Freezer's brother Cooler swears revenge. Son Goku and his friends have once again to fight the evil in order to keep the miraculous Dragon Balls.<br><br>In this game, you control many characters from the animé series, including Son Goku, Son Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yamcha, Trunk, and even the archrival Vegeta, who has now joined the team. In battles, you have three active characters, but you can switch and train them in between. The RPG system is similar to the one used in the first two games: your movements on the field and during battles are determined by the type of cards you choose from several available ones. The cinematic battle sequences are now more fast-paced, and there are many mini-games to speed up the leveling up.",
