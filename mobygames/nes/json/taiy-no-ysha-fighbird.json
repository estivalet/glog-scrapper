  "description": "<i>Taiy? no Y?sha: Fighbird</i> is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game is based on a mecha anime of the same title.<br><br>The solar system is under  threat by aliens that are being led by Dryas, with the help of a human mad scientist named Dr. Jango. The Space Police Force (SPF) is tasked with seeking out the Evil Energy that constitutes Dryas and destroying the mechabeasts that he deploys to attack the human race whether in Earth or in space. <br><br>The player at the start of the game gets to choose between two characters, Kenta, a special member of the SPF and grandson of Dr. Hiroshi Amano, the scientist that develops the mechs of the SPF; or the main character, Yuutarou Katori, the human identity of the space guardian known as Fighbird. <br><br>The game has four stages with 3 phases: the first phase starts with the player selecting one of the members of the machine rescue team known as the Baron Team (which the player can swap with any of the vehicles anytime); the second phase starts the player with Fire Jet and performing specific tasks, like destroying or collecting certain objects, and the last phase is where the player plays as Fighbird himself and goes on to fight the stage bosses.",
