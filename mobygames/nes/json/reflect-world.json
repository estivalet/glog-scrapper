  "description": "In <i>Reflect World</i>, players take control of a futuristic hover tank while exploring a hostile planet. Shooting down enemies earns the player gold. which can be spent at weapon shops. At a weapon shop, players can purchase different ammo sizes for their main cannon, the class of their generator, increased capacity for their fuel tank, and fuel for their fuel tank. Also for sale are items that affect how the tank fires out its ammo. Fuel is the most important thing to keep track of since getting hit by enemy fire decreases it and the game ends when all the fuel is empty. <br><br>The majority of the game consists of exploring the planet surface searching for dungeon entrances, finding the way through said dungeons to get to the exit, in order to get to different parts of the planet.",
