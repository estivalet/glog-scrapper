  "description": "<i>Family Jockey</i> is a horse racing game for the Nintendo Famicom. You can choose between a one player or two player simultaneous mode. At the start you must choose a horse. Horses have different skill levels like speed, stamina or jump. During the race the horses and the course are displayed from a top-down view. You increase the speed of your horse by using your whip, which in return results in an energy decrease, so it must be used with care. There are two different surface types (lawn and dirt) and some courses have obstacles that you have to jump over. You must place at least in the top 4 of each race to continue with the game. Placing higher increases the prize money. Besides a mode that concentrates purely on the racing part you can choose a so called &quot;Family Game&quot; which includes a betting part in addition to the racing.",
