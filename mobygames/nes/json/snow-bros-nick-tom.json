  "description": "Nick and Tom are two Princes living the dream with two beautiful princesses. When suddenly the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Nick and Tom and kidnaps the Princesses. Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.<br><br><i>Snow Bros.</i> is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use  snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into  giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually  defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.",
