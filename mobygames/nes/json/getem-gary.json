  "description": "<i>Get'em Gary</i> is a prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/handy-harvy\">Handy Harvy</a> and it was created during the development of that game. It draws inspiration from titles like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Donkey+Kong\">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wrecking-crew\">Wrecking Crew</a>, but also <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fix-it-felix-jr\">Fix It Felix Jr.</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Disney\">Disney</a> movie <i>Wreck-it Ralph</i>.<br><br>The local neighbourhood punk Rusty is destroying the windows of the Westspring Manor apartment building with firecrackers and bombs. Gary is the building's property manager. He has to fix Rusty's mess by repairing windows and closing their shutters.<br><br>The game consists of several fixed, single screens. Gary starts at the bottom and needs to fix and close all broken windows to win the section and move on to a higher part in the next screen. This continues until the roof of the building is reached and Rusty is defeated.<br><br>Gary only has 60 seconds to win a screen. There are multiple ledges and he can also only climb up when there is a gutter and sometimes there are plants and crates that block the way. In the meantime Rusty moves about on the highest ledge and constantly drops bombs, bowling balls and game consoles that hurt Gary and take away one of his two starting lives. The level is won only when all broken windows are repaired and the shutters are closed before time runs out. Rusty can break windows again with his bombs that a little time to detonate.<br><br>Every now and then a turbo burger appears as a bonus item. It needs to be picked up quickly before it disappears. It grants a brief period of invincibility and provides double points for each shutter closed.<br><br>The Windows version is identical and uses GGvm, a virtual machine for NES games written in JAVA.",
