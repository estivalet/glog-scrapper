  "description": "This cartridge contains three adventures. Your life meter is displayed as scrolls and when you are hit, you lose a half a scroll. When all the scrolls are gone, your game is over. You can collect additional scrolls in the game but to get the scroll, you will need to correctly answer a Biblical question.<br><br>In <b>The Wise Men</b>, you are the camel taking the wise men to Bethlehem to see the baby Jesus. Along the way, in addition to scrolls, you can gather gold, frankincense and myrrh for points. You can run and jump and spit water balls at your enemies. You can also collect fruits that can be used against enemies. Fruits are more powerful than water balls and some enemies can only be destroyed with fruits.<br><br><i>&quot;After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem...&quot;</i><br><br>In <b>Flight to Egypt</b>, you are the donkey carrying Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus away from Bethlehem to Egypt to escape Herod's wrath. You will have to run from, jump over or kick enemies and/or obstacles.<br><br><i>&quot;When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. 'Get up,' he said, 'take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.'&quot;</i><br><br>In <b>Jesus and the Temple</b>, you are Joseph and Mary, searching for young Jesus, who has become separated from you after you have left from the feast of the Passover. You must run from or through and jump over enemies and obstacles within a time limit. If the timer runs out on any level before you finish, you will have to restart.<br><br><i>&quot;After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.&quot;</i>",
