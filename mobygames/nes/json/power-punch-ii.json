  "description": "Mark Tyler, the world's most famous boxer, boasts that he is absolutely invincible and that he can defeat any contender in the world. Nay, the universe! Well, as luck would have it, a race of alien fighters heard Mark's claims and have decided to abduct him and pit him against the fiercest boxers in the galaxy.<br><br><i>Power Punch 2</i> is a one-on-one boxing game à la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Punch-Out%21%21\">Punch Out</a>, in which you control Mark as he battles all of the alien contenders in hopes of winning the galactic boxing belt. The game is played from a third person perspective from which you see both fighters as they fight. You have rudimentary movement controls but the basic mechanics involve dodging and timing your attacks so that you can break the enemies' patterns. Between fights you get to train in a gym, which involve taking part in a series of mini-games with the rewards being upgraded strength, speed, or health for your upcoming bout.",
