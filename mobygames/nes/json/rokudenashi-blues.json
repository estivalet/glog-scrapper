  "description": "<i>Rokudenashi Blues</i> is a role-playing game based on the Japanese manga by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,95863/\">Masanori Morita</a>. The game allows you to play as Taison Maeda as well as three other characters, each with their own storylines. Most of the game takes place at the high school. Like most RPG games, you get an overworld map, but instead of walking to where you want, a menu on the bottom of the screen will let you select where your character goes to. The main goal of the game is to complete each fight. Doing so will take you to different areas of the game. The fight system functions like any normal RPG game, except it is viewed in the form of cutscenes. The game also contains a save feature with battery backup.<br><br>Another <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=SNES\">Rokudenashi Blues</a> game was released for the Super Famicom by Bandai and contains different gameplay from its Famicom counterpart.",
