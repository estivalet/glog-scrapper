  "description": "Wally Bear needs to find all of his friends for the party at his parents house, but he has an awful lot of obstacles to overcome! Riding a skateboard through the streets he must dodge dive-bombing pigeons, rabid bull dogs, and anthropomorphic animals who want to get him hooked on drugs and jumped into a gang. Worst of all: he's got to beat the curfew as well!<br><br><i>Wally Bear and the NO! Gang</i> is a side-scrolling platformer designed to teach kids the dangers of doing drugs, gang banging and hanging out with the wrong crowd. Most obstacles can be avoided, but Wally can also bop enemies on the head with his skateboard. The game features seven levels to traverse and a total of two power ups to find all while racing against the clock to help out your friends.",
