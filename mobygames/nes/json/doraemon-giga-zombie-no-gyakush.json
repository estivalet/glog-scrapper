  "description": "This game is based on the animé series about the mechanical blue cat Doraemon, who can turn dream into reality and create magical worlds where he helps people and fights the evil. <br><br>Some time ago, Giga Zombie revived dead kings in order to conquer the world. Doraemon and his friends fought the evil being, but were trapped in a magical portal, and ended up in different time periods. In this game, the nameless hero (you can choose to be either male or female) must help Doraemon to find his friends and to save the world once again.<br><br>The game is a traditional top-down RPG with turn-based party combat viewed from first person perspective. The unusual part is the time traveling. You and your party can travel to different time periods, change the present and discover many secrets.",
