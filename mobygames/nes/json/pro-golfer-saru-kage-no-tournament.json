  "description": "Based on the manga turned anime, <i>Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament</i> is a golf game starring  the young golfer Sarumaru Sarutani.<br><br>The main game consists of a tournament mode which contains two 18 hole golf courses. The prehistoric themed Ryu course and the more modern themed Tecno course. While the courses have traditional hazards like bunkers and water traps, there are also nontraditional hazards to contend with such as whirlwinds, turbines, and critters. Players can select from a handful of golf clubs and choose where they want the club to make contact with the golf ball, then aim where they want the ball to go, and hit the ball by gauging the amount of power using the swing meter. <br><br>There is also a training mode that lets the player practice their golf game.\n",
