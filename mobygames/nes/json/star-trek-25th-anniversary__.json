  "description": "The Ship Enterprise is on a 5 year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. While the Enterprise is investigating strange gravitational disturbances, it is drawn into a dimensional hole and ends up in unknown space with broken warp engines. Now, Captain Kirk and his crew must try to repair the ship and find a way home.<br><br>Gameplay is divided into two parts, taking place on the ship's bridge and away missions. On the bridge, you can communicate with other ships, call up a map to navigate the ship (once the warp engines are fixed), enter battle mode to fight other ships (which does not happen very often), save the game or beam down to a planet's surface.<br>\nThese away missions make up the major part of the game and play very much like other action adventures. You can talk to aliens find and use objects, solve puzzles and fight against hostile lifeforms.  Battles with other ships or on away missions are handled in simple Shoot'em Up-fashion.",
