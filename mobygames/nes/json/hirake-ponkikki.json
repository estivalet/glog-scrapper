  "description": "<i>Hirake! Ponkikki</i> was a long-running Japanese children's program similar to <i>Sesame Street</i>; this game features the show's two main characters, Gachapin the dinosaur and Mukku the yeti, in a little friendly competition.  Five mini-games repeat over the course of five islands, and each island must be cleared of all five games before proceeding to the next. The set-up is mainly intended for two players, with one player controlling Gachapin and the other Mukku.  In one-player mode, either character may be selected, but the CPU will not compete at any game other than rock-paper-scissors.  Players begin with a limited number of lives which may be lost by colliding with enemies or performing poorly at minigames; one extra life is also awarded at the end of each island. However, there is also a password system which allows the game to be resumed from any island.<br><br>The minigames are as follows:<ul>\n<li>Platforming: Collect fruit while avoiding enemies in a slowly auto-scrolling platforming game.  Whoever gets the most fruit wins.</li>\n<li>Shape Matching: Hurry to match the most shapes before time expires.</li>\n<li>The Shell Game: Pick out the spaceship with the other character in five rounds of the shell game.</li>\n<li>Rock-Paper-Scissors: Defeat the other character a set number of times at the classic hand game.</li>\n<li>Maze Chase: Race against the other player to collect the most candy apples before exiting.  In later levels, avoid worms as well.</li></ul>\n",
