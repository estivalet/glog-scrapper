  "description": "<i>Yamamura Misa Suspense: Ky?to Zai-tech Satsujin Jiken</i> is the last part of the trilogy of the Yamamura Misa Suspense games released for the Famicom in Japan. Like the other games, the game takes place in a first-perspective with text options to select. A few times in the game you will have to click on things on the graphic screen with a pointer, but a majority of the game will be spent selecting actions from the menu. The game takes place near the middle of August. The dead body of a woman has been found and you must search for the murderer. To do this you must perform many tasks such as traveling to different locations and asking people what they have seen or heard about the murder. During the course of the game, the player may save their game at any point.",
