  "description": "Danny Sullivan, 1988 IndyCar champion and winner of the classic 'Spin &amp; Win' Indianapolis 500 in 1985, put his name to this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a> style racing game. There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Indianapolis+500\">Indianapolis 500</a>, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).<br><br>The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.",
