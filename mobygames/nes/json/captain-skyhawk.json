  "description": "Aliens are draining the energy from the Earth and plan to totally destroy it when they're through. Only Captain Skyhawk and his F-14VTS fighter jet can get rid of these alien invaders.<br><br>The game features eight missions which are broken up into different phases. One phase is a vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up which has the action viewed from a top down perspective with a 3D landscape.  Players get to destroy enemy installations and bases during this phase. Another phase has gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=After+Burner\">After Burner</a> where the player has to take out enemy aircraft. Another phase has the player carefully docking their aircraft into a space station. The planes weaponry can be upgraded or refilled at these space stations by spending the credits the player has earned by defeating enemy aircraft. After successfully completing all the missions the player has to destroy the final alien space station.",
