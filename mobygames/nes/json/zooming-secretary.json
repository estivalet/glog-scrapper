The caller want answers and they want them quick, a phone call starts blue, then red and finally white, before hanging up. Miss five calls and you're fired, although they immediately rehire meaning you have infinite continues.<br><br>Also in the office are your co-workers, they mostly distract you from your work although some of them could be helpful. There's the chief who likes to give you instructions and thing that it will make you hurry, but in fact it only slows things down. A woman in red dress with cookies who hangs around all the day, she's big so you can't pass through her. A tall nerdy girl who likes to talk very much, but can't concentrate. She constantly changes topics and may confuse you, but sometimes she may tell something that you actually need.
