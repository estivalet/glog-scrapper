  "description": "The young hero Bam sets out on a journey to rescue his parents, who have been transformed into monsters. His journey through a large game world ends bringing him into conflict with the clan of the evil Domes and a quest to save the world itself. Luckily, he's equipped with his trusty sword, which he can upgrade over the course of the game, and defeating enemies lets him collect little bits of fire which can be used as currency at shops. Players explore the world from a side-view perspective, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link\">Zelda II</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ys+III%3a+Wanderers+from+Ys\">Ys III</a>; as they defeat bosses and explore dungeons, the world itself expands, giving them new places to explore.",
