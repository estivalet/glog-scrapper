  "description": "One of many grand war simulations in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Daisenryaku+series\">Daisenryaku series</a>, Daisenryaku for Famicom is a turn-based strategy with quite modern armies, the abstract &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Red&quot; countries (controlled by the player or AI), are at war with each other.<br><br>Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc.  Attack is possible, when enemies are near.<br><br>The game includes 30 maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.)  Each terrain type has different movement and defence values.<br><br>This version uses &quot;fake hexagons&quot; for battlefields; the hexagons are in fact squares, with six neighbours. As opposed to most other versions, it has round-based combat, i.e. a turn ends when the player has moved all the units. It also has a less complex management system than the computer versions. ",
