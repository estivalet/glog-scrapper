  "description": "<i>B-Wings</i> is a vertically scrolling space shooter that owes its name to the space fighter from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Star+Wars\"> Star Wars</a> movies. You have a wide variety of weapons at your disposal: Fire, Cannons, Jump, Hammer, etc. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Cannon fires powerful and rapid blasts, but you can only shoot directly in front of you; Van covers several directions, but has slow speed; Anti builds a protective shield around you each time you shoot, but its range is very small, and so on. You can change the weapons every time you are killed, before you run out of lives and lose the game. Typically, at the end of a level you'll have to face a boss enemy.",
