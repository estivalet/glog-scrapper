The player can choose to have the quarters last from one minute to twelve minutes. Also, if you are playing as the  Harlem Globetrotters you are able to pull off special maneuvers such as a behind the back pass, slam dunk, and a piggy back slam. At certain moments during the game the Harlem Globetrotters team can also interfere with the referee by pulling down his pants and tripping him.",
