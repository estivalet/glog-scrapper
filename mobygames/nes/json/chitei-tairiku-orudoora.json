  "description": "<i>Chitei Tairiku Orudoora</i> features two educational math games. <br><br>The first game is a side-scrolling platformer. Players control a boy who explores the underground cave system of Orudoora. The boy can jump, duck, and throw bombs to dispose of enemies. The game consists of 31 areas. In the first 10 areas players have to locate an inner tube, an oar, and an onigiri. Finding them will allow the player to advance further into the game. In the next 10 areas players will have to find the items again in order to advance in the game. Then once again for the third and final time, players will have to find the items again in order to move on and face the final boss. In order to exit an area players have to hit a Goblin enemy who will initiate a math problem. Players have to answer three of these math problems correctly to be allowed to leave an area.<br><br>The second game is called Step Drill in which players race a motorcycle through Europe. To get a good time, players have to answer 39 math problems in total as fast as they can.",
