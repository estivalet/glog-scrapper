  "description": "<i>Jet-Paco</i> is a NES conversion of the ZX Spectrum game of the same name only available as part of the 2013 release <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mojon+Twins+Covertape+%232\">Mojon Twins Covertape #2</a>. The player controls the astronaut Paco Rebollez. He is in charge of harvesting and collecting energonia crystals, a resource used to power space ships. The game consists of two missions, selectable from the title screen, where he has to collect 20 crystals.<br><br>The missions consist of several single-screen rooms connected vertically and horizontally so there is free exploration to collect the crystals in any order. He can fly around with an unlimited amount of fuel using a jet pack. Movement is based on thrust, so the player can either keep a button pressed to keep rising or use small taps to hover and navigate small passages. He can fly through platforms but will land on them when landing from above. There are hazard and enemies in irregular patterns to avoid. Paco has no means to attack, the focus is on careful navigation using the jet pack mechanic. He starts with ten lives and no additional ones can be earned. The HUD shows how many crystals are left to be found.<br><br>Next to the free download release there was an exclusive crowdfunded release with the game on a NTSC/PAL cartridge. Based on the tier different extras were provided such as having your name listed in the game's credits, a full box and manual instead of just the cartridge, a full box and manual with the cartridge and signed by the authors, a surprise NES homebrew cartridge with a game from another developer, physical versions of the ZX Spectrum games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/uwol-quest-for-money\">Uwol: Quest for Money</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/goku-mal\">Goku Mal</a>, become the protagonist in the game with a modified game sprite, a Mojon Twins T-shirt or access to the NES mold used for the cartridge.",
