  "description": "Dark Forces have attacked the land of Aritia. You're controlling some of the members of the Aritan's forces that escaped from their country and came on the island of Tamis for safety. Unfortunately, a group of pirates is invading the Tamis, and it's up to you to control the island again.<br><br><i>Fire Emblem</i> is a strategy game where you have to move your units on a map. You can control the blue units while the red ones are enemies. You have to attack enemies from various ranges, in function of the weapon you're using. Usually, you have to be one or two squares next to the enemy. When a battle is set, you see both characters; allies in blue on the right and the opponent in red on the left with a detailed animation. The enemy will counterattack if he can, and either you or the enemy may also do one more hit to close the battle. When you've finished, it's the computer's turn and it will do the same with its units. Once the HP (Health Points) of any unit reaches 0, they are definitely out of battle and can't return again, whether it's an enemy or an ally.",
