  "description": "<i>W? xiang niào niào</i> is a deliberately difficult 2D side-scrolling platform game created for the 2016 NESdev comptition. It consists of four main levels with two parts each. In each level the girl Lin Lin needs to navigate difficult platform sections while collecting flies. She needs the flies to please the Frog King so he gets out of the way and Lin Lin gets to use the toilet, which ends the level. If Lin Lin has collected at least eight flies when she reaches the king, she gets to play a bonus level where any flies she collects are carried over to the second part of the level. The second part is more difficult each time because it is auto-scrolling and Lin Lin needs to advance quickly. Each level has a different theme introducing new challenges such as bouncing blocks for instance.<br><br>Lin Lin has no means to attack. Next to the jumping the only action she can perform is a butt stomp which launches her off an enemy. This technique with careful timing is most often used to cross large gaps, used as a double jump technique. She starts with three lives and when a life is lost the entire level is restarted until she picks up a piece of poo which acts as a checkpoint. A life is lost right away when falling down a gap, but when she touches an enemy she only loses her clothes and can continue. A second hit is then fatal unless she finds an item that brings back her clothes.",
