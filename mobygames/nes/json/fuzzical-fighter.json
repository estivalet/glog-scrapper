  "description": "The world of Funny is facing troubled times. The Dimensional Stone, which offered protection to this world, was stolen. The king needs someone to locate the Dimensional Stone. He makes a request that his subject Mark pilot the flying craft, called the Fuzzical Fighter, and go and recover this stone.<br><br>The main gameplay involves flying the Fuzzical Fighter through several side-scrolling stages, shooting at or using magic against the incoming attacking enemies. At the end of each stage is a boss fight. Defeating enemies during this portion of the game earns the player gold.<br><br>Between stages, the player visits different towns where they can spend the gold they have earned on different items in the various shops. Players can buy different weapons, engines, and shields for their Fuzzical Fighter to equip. Players can also restore the Fuzzical Fighter's health and magic points too.\n ",
