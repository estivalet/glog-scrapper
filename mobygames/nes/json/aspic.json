  "description": "<i>Aspic</i> is an Action Role Playing game utilizing a first person perspective in dungeons. Battles occur in real time on a separate arena similar to Zelda II's map encounters. Players can recruit extra warriors and pick which warrior will engage in combat. The game is a sequel to Xtalsoft's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lizard\">Lizard</a> and is notorious for its dark ending which doesn't end in the player's favor.<br><br>Aspic begins from the ending of the first game. Having obtained the Book of Truth which can break the curse on the princess, Samson returns to the king only to find that the princess is missing. Three days prior to the events of Aspic, a witch had appeared and informed the king that there was another way to save the princess, so the king entrusted his daughter's life to the witch. Although the witch did undo the curse on the princess, it turned out that she did so to have the princess marry the demon king Aspic. Samson, whom the king had begged to save the princess, goes on another cruel adventure to save her.<br><br>Leveling up in the game will only have players gain attack power. Players can raise their HP by donating money to the temple. Money can only be obtained from treasure chests scattered inside dungeons and there are no weapons and armor that can be bought or found. Recovery items are only useful for the companions as the hero can only recover his strength at fountains, but the hero can absorb MP from his enemies after defeating them. While enemies are visible in dungeons and can be avoided, the game switches to random encounters on the world map.\n",
