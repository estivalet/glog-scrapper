  "description": "<i>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt</i> is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series <i>The Addams Family</i> (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.<br><br>This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/addams-family\">The Addams Family</a> - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/addams-family-pugsleys-scavenger-hunt_\">SNES version</a> of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.",
