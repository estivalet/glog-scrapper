  "description": "This is a RPG set in the universe of the animé series <i>Hokuto no Ken</i>, known outside of Japan as <i>Fist of the North Star</i>. You, the nameless young hero, return to your home village after a prolonged absence, only to find out that a mysterious evil has been plaguing it, and everybody need his help. He decides to investigate the matter and starts a dangerous journey, during which he teams up with some of the characters from the animé series.<br><br>The gameplay is pretty similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dragon+Quest\"> Dragon Quest</a>: you interact with things and people by choosing commands from a menu, wander around the world map and fight random enemies from first-person perspective. The enemies and your team members are shown as animé-style pictures during battles.",
