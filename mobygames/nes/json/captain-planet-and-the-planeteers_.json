  "description": "Based on the cartoon series of the same name, Captain Planet and the Planeteers are environmental protectors. Each Planeteer is endowed with a special elemental power which is used to combat pollution, preserve the environment and keep everything ship-shape. When the Planeteers combine powers, a superhero - Captain Planet, guardian of the Earth - is summoned. The powers of Gaia keep watch over the world, and assign the Planeteers to where they are needed.<br><br><i>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</i> is an action sidescroller game divided into two sections: inside levels and outside levels. Outside levels usually put the Planeteers in some kind of vehicle which can move in any of eight directions on the screen. The planeteers can use any of their elemental powers, drained from an energy bar: Fire shoots a fireball directly ahead, Water shoots out a water wave, Wind lets loose defensive air currents, Earth tosses stones out of the earth and Heart calms animal creatures. Touching an enemy or projectile results in instant death. <br><br>Inside levels summon Captain Planet himself, who can punch or turn himself into a swirling version of any of the five elements. Captain Planet can also move/fly in any of eight directions and also can only take one hit before dying. Power-ups can also be found on these levels. ",
