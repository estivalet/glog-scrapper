  "description": "<i>Destiny of an Emperor</i> is a strategy role-playing game set in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Three+Kingdoms\">Three Kingdoms</a> era. A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each have a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Sima Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).
