  "description": "From the ingame intro:<br><br>&quot;Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.\nHe has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!&quot;<br><br><i>Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six</i> is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.<br><br>Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.",
