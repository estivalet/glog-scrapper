  "description": "A boy named Tim and his little sister Judy go to a circus. They want to buy tickets to enter the circus, but they only have money for one ticket, so only Judy goes in. After the show, the boy is at the exit to meet Judy when she comes out, but when she doesn’t the boy sneaks into the circus to rescue his sister from the ringmaster Mr. Magic who has taken her hostage.<br><br>The game is a platformer, you must get past many clowns, tight rope artists, and make it over water by jumping on top of alligators. You can also go into small tents to play mini-games.",
