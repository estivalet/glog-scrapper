  "description": "Having heard of the legend of the hero Raru, a young swordsman decides to go on a quest to also become a hero. On his way, he stops at an inn in the town of Hyuma. When he wakes up, the town is in turmoil; walls have erected on all sides, and the only way to the outside world is an underground passage...<br><br><i>Deep Dungeon III</i> is a first-person RPG, the first game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Deep+Dungeon+series\">Deep Dungeon series</a> to feature a four-member party. The player now has the choice of three characters of one of the three available classes - ranger, magician and priest - to accompany the swordsman on his quest. These companions may die in combat, and can only be replaced if the player encounters new ones while exploring. If the swordsman is defeated, however, the game is over. The game starts in the town of Hyuma, where the player explores to find the passageway to the undergrounds, visiting the town's shops along the way. The game features the same mechanics added in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/yshi-no-monsh-deep-dungeon\">Deep Dungeon II</a>: upon leveling-up, the player attributes points to the character's stats, and when the character's level is too high for the monsters on a dungeon's floor, there are no more random battles. The game has a number of dungeons to explore, as opposed to only one in the previous installments. ",
