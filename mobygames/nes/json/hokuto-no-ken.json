  "description": "<i>Hokuto no Ken</i> is a side-scrolling beat-em-up based on the anime series of the same name. The player controls Kenshiro, the series' main character, trying to rescue his girlfriend Julia. Advancing from right to left there will be various doors that can be entered. At some of those doors Julia's image is visible, which points out the correct way to go. Other than entering doors, Kenshiro will be busy punching and kicking punk-like enemies that attack up close or with projectiles. The game features gory animation for the deaths of your foes: their heads get torn away from the bodies and explode.",
