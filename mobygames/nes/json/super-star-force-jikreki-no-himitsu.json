  "description": "In the Almanac dimension, the year 2010 brought in the final destruction of the evil planet Gordess by the space patroller Final Star. However, this doesn't bring closure of what happened in the past and how the planet Gordess came into existence. So now it's up to Commander Ralph to travel in time through six distinct time periods in the Neo Final Star space patroller and finally figure what exactly caused Gordess to come into existence.<br><br>Gameplay involves flying in a vertically scrolling shooter defeating various enemies in order to collect time pieces. Time pieces can be spent at teleporters so that the player can travel to different time periods and also these time pieces can be spent at shops in order to buy equipment.<br><br>The player can also find buildings to enter into. The game turns from being a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up to an isometric dungeon exploration shooter. The main objective in these areas is to locate one of the seven time stones.<br><br>",
