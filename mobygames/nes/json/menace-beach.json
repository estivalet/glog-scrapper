To free her, the player must travel on a skateboard thorough multiple town and sewer levels and battle evil clowns, Elvis impersonators, and randomly appearing Ninjas.<br><br>To help (and sometimes hinder) the player a man randomly throws ketchup bottles, wrenches, and bombs out of widows and random holes in the sewer walls. These items can be picked up and thrown at the enemies in order to defeat them more effectively than with their fists.",
