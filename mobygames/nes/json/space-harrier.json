  "description": "Run… fly… dodge those obstacles, but return fire on wave after wave of attacking aliens. Armed with a really big gun, you have to defend yourself against the alien hordes using your wits to navigate around the screen. But watch out for those end of level bosses!<br><br>Originating in the arcades, <i>Space Harrier</i> is a third-person rail shooter with pseudo-3D graphics, set in the same world as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fantasy-zone\">Fantasy Zone</a>. The lone titular hero fights aliens with a fireball-launching cannon, which can also be used to transform the hero into a flying rocket. The protagonist is constantly in motion, but the speed of his movement can be regulated by the player.",
