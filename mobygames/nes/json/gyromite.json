  "description": "In Gyromite, you need to help a mad scientist deactivate all of the dynamite in his laboratory before time runs out! ROB the robot will assist you in this game by moving the red and blue pillars blocking the way. Just in case finding your way through the laboratory wasn't enough, be sure to watch out for the deadly Smicks who wander about trying to prevent success of your mission. If you find a radish, pick it up and feed it to the Smicks so you can safely get past them. There is also a second game variation where you need to clear the way for a sleepwalking mad scientist so he can get home safely.",
