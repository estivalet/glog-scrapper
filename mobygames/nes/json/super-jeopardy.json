  "description": "<i>Super Jeopardy!</i> is based on the popular Jeopardy! TV game show. In this digital incarnation, 4 players compete at answering reverse trivia questions in trademark Jeopardy! fashion-- i.e., the host provides the answer and a player has to provide the questions. As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.<br><br>A player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the &quot;What is...&quot; question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.",
