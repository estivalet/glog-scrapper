Hattori has the ability to jump and throw shurikens. He can also collect scrolls that allow him to use up to eleven different ninja techniques. Hattori can get touched up to nine times by most enemy ninjas before dying. However some enemies can kill Hattori in one hit. Projectiles thrown from enemies that hit Hattori typically just stun him.\n",
