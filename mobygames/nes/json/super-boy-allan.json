  "description": "<i>Super Boy Allan</i> is the second game in Sunsoft's &quot;Intelligence Game&quot; edutainment series for the Famicom Disk System, featuring two different game modes.<br><br>The first game mode, which is also the main game, has the player control a boy on his search for a healing herb. The environment looks strikingly similar to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/legend-of-zelda\">The Legend of Zelda</a> game. The player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items. Solving math problems also increases your ability to move several logs at once, which is needed to make further progress.<br><br>The second, and much simpler game mode, has the player to finish a 39-steps marathon run by correctly answering simple math questions to accumulate as many points as possible.",
