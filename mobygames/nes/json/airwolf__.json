  "description": "<i>Airwolf</i> is a side-scrolling shooter based on the 1980s TV series of the same name. A division of the CIA builds itself a hi-tech helicopter in secrecy and codenames it &quot;AirWolf&quot;. Armed with advanced weaponry, it is able to stand up to most types of enemy resistance. Given missions by intelligence agent Archangel, Airwolf is sent around to world on top-secret missions to quell trouble.<br><br>Before each mission, the player is briefed and allowed to choose a primary and secondary weapon for Airwolf's firing buttons. From this, Airwolf then fires at enemies that appear on the screen and approaches a boss weapon. The game then switches to first-person, where the boss must be targeted in different locations.",
