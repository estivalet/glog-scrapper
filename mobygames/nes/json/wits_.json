  "description": "The console version of <i>Wit's</i>, while playing very similarly to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/wits\">arcade version</a>, still has a few slight overall differences. While the arcade version has you progress through 99 levels, the console version has, much like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Mega+Man+%2f+Rockman+series\">Mega Man series</a>, a stage select screen where you choose the opponent you're to face off against. Each of the five initial levels consists of five rounds and features a different gameplay gimmick that you'll have to master. In addition to the single player game, the game also features various multiplayer modes for up to four players.\n",
