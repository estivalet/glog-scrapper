Players can get a report of enemy movement, examine the space in surrounding fields, get a view of the galactic map, get the latest damage report, load their torpedoes, and adjust their phaser weapons power.<br><br>After the player is done with the command center they can enter view mode. The view mode lets the player see their ship in a current sector of space. Players are able to fly around with their ship and fire their torpedoes and phasers at any enemy ships they may happen to run into. Players can also warp their ship to other sections of the galaxy. If the player's ship receives any type of damage they can dock their ship at a base for repairs. ",
