  "description": "Bases Loaded 4 was <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Jaleco\">Jaleco's</a> last 8-bit entry in the long-running baseball series. The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.<br><br>Geared more toward fast-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players' Association, and did not feature real American or Japanese teams or players.",
