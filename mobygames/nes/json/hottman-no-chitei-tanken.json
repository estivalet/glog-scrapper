  "description": "In <i>Hott?man no Chitei Tanken</i>, players help guide Hott?man as he explores fifteen different underground locales. The most important part of Hott?man's exploration efforts is to find four keys that are contained in treasure chests spread about in each location. Finding these keys will unlock the exit, so he can continue exploring the next location.<br><br>The games underground exploration is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dig-dug\">Dig Dug</a>, however the underground is much larger here and is able to be scrolled as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a>.<br><br>While exploring the underground, digging up dirt and rocks, players have to be wary of various obstacles and enemies. Obstacles include blocks, pits that can transport Hott?man to a different area, streams of water, and even lava pools. If the player stays to long in a level, vertical streams of lava will start to appear, making the lever harder and more dangerous to traverse. <br><br>Of course Hott?man's not completely helpless against these enemies and obstacles. Hott?man's equipped with a flamethrower that he can fire against his enemies. He can also pick up items to add to his inventory. Items can sometimes be found just lying around the level openly, or can be found inside several of the treasure chests and eggs that are spread around. Items that are part of his inventory include a fire-proof coat to use against lava, a range item that extends the range of the flame weapon, a blockade item that can block pursuing enemies, both a fruit and a garlic item which help distract enemies, and dynamite which can blow up blocks that are in the way. Only four of each of these items are allowed to be held in the player's inventory. There are also other items like the power shovel which can also aid Hott?man.<br><br>",
