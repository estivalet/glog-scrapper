  "description": "The legend of Momotar? belongs to the most popular ones in Japanese and Asian folklore. The game follows the main story. An old couple, who was living peacefully in a small house, found a giant peach flowing down the river. As they wanted to eat the peach, they found inside a child. They named him &quot;Momotar?&quot; -&quot;peach guy&quot;. When Momotar? grew up, he decided to rid the country of the evil demons. He must find three faithful companions - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, who will help him to defeat the demons. <br><br>This is a traditional Japanese RPG. You move Momotar? over the world map, visiting towns and dungeons. Defeated monsters bring experience points and raise Momotar?'s level. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based and is viewed from first person perspective.",
