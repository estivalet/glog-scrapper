  "description": "<i>AO</i> is a homebrew puzzle game. Each of the 33 levels consists of a fixed, single screen environment where a brick needs to be guided to a goal pit (exit point) in a maze-like environment shown through a top-down view. The brick is controlled directly and the view is in 2D, but the player needs to think in 3D to solve the puzzle. The brick takes up two spaces when it is laying on its side and one space when it is standing up. To get around in the maze the brick often needs to be brought into a specific position so it can move without falling off the edge. For instance: some passages only have room for a single space and then the brick cannot pass unless it is in a good position. When falling off the ledge the level restarts right away and there are unlimited lives. Gradually additional elements are introduced such as switches, teleportation blocks and weak floors. The game contains a competitive two-player mode where two players move through the maze simultaneously with the goal to reach the exit first. The game provides 1,000 seconds to complete the game, but it is possible to continue playing even when time has run out.",
