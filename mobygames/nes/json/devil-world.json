  "description": "<i>Devil World</i> is a scrolling maze game, strikingly similar to the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>, only with an undeniable religious bent. Collect dots in an automatically-scrolling maze directed by the devil himself, use crosses to power up and destroy his minions, and be careful not to get crushed by the walls. After collecting all the dots, you must collect bibles to seal up the source of the enemies and make the devil temporarily retreat. After this, there is a timed bonus stage where the player can control the scrolling, then the next round starts the cycle over from the beginning.",
