  "description": "&quot;Mermaids of Atlantis&quot; is basically a non-adult version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bubble-bath-babes\"> Bubble Bath Babes</a>. Only instead of a naked girl there is a mermaid who is wearing a bra. This mermaid lies on the bottom of the play field and sends colored bubbles into the air. What you must do is arrange the bubbles in such a way that they build a row of 4 or more of the same color. The game uses the same graphics (except the mermaid) and gameplay mechanics as the original, adding three difficulty settings, the possibility to begin from any stage, and a background story: the evil underwater emperor O-Dinten has sealed all the games (yes, that's right!) into bubbles, and you must complete the game to unlock them and to bring entertainment back to the sea people.",
