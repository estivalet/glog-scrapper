  "description": "This version of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> is a Chinese-made unlicensed &quot;demake&quot; (a remake of a game that uses inferior technology) of the popular Japanese RPG <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=final+fantasy+vii+playstation\"> Final Fantasy VII</a>. This version retains most of the dialogue (translated into Chinese) of the original release, and, with a few exceptions, the narrative develops in exactly the same way.<br><br>Naturally, given the much more limited technology of this version's platform, everything else has been changed accordingly. For all purposes, the game looks, sounds, and plays like a Famicom (NES) game. Much of the graphics and sounds have been ripped from other games (usually early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=final+fantasy\"> Final Fantasy</a> installments).<br><br>The gameplay underwent some significant changes. Many of the monsters are entirely different. The difficulty level is much higher than in the original version. The game still retains the materia system (equipment imbued with magic spells that can grow), but it has been simplified, and the growth is much slower. The characters are unable to execute any &quot;limit break&quot; attacks.<br><br>Much of the original game's content has been eliminated, such as all the mini-games, optional locations (there is no town of Wutai), optional characters (no Yuffie and/or Vincent), and optional bosses (no &quot;weapon&quot; monsters).",
