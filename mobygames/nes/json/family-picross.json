  "description": "<i>Family Picross</i> is a homebrew picross puzzle game. It keeps the classic puzzle game formula using the numbers on top and to the left of each row and column to fill in the boxes. The player controls the cursor directly and moves over the boxes. A single button is used to toggle between the three box states: selected, crossed out or open.<br><br>There are more than 100 puzzles to complete, starting from very small puzzles to large and complex ones. Options including entering a name, a selection between three music tracks, stopping the cursor at the edges or allowing it to wrap around, and the ability to continue using a password. A password is provided after completing each puzzle. The game also keeps track of the high scores as puzzles have a time limit. Completing puzzles in a short time provides more points. It is possible to continue playing and complete the puzzle even when time has run out, but that costs one of the three lives provided.<br><br>The game is available as a ROM download and a successful Kickstarter campaign was launched to provide a cartridge version in three varieties: box, loose cartridge and a solutionist version with a solutions guide to all puzzles.",
