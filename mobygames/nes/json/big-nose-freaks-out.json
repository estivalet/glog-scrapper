  "description": "On a Tuesday afternoon sometime in 17 million BC, Big Nose the caveman was on his way to the Savings and Bones to deposit a large amount of savings. But before he got there, Leroy the Lizardman knocked out Big Nose and stole his savings. When Big Nose woke up and realized his savings were gone, he freaked out! Now he created a wheel with a platform on it and is out to get Leroy. Big Nose Freaks Out is a side scrolling platform action game. There are five sections of gameplay each with four levels to clear. At the end of each section Leroy will be waiting with a large monster. To fight back Big Nose has his trusty club with him. Also, rocks can be found along the way and the club used to bat them at enemies. There are many hidden treasures, hidden levels, and even some level warps to search for.<br><br>The game also features two different two player modes. The <i>Two Player Relay</i> mode has two players taking turns on the normal single player game, Once one player dies in a level, the other player continues where the first player left off. In the <i>Two Player Challenge</i> mode players take turns and each player is given sixty seconds to collect as many bones as they can in five different rounds. The player who collects the most bones wins.",
