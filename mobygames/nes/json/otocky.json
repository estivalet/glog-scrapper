  "description": "In <i>Otocky</i>, players pilot a flying creature throughout eleven horizontal scrolling stages on a mission to collect musical notes. The creature is equipped with a ball that can be fired in eight different directions. Depending on the direction it is fired it will create a unique sound, thus merging with the background music, creating a rhythm to the action going on. The ball is meant to collect musical notes, but it can also take out enemies that are getting in the way. The creature is also equipped with a limited projectile attack in case the enemies start to get too overwhelming, The object of each stage is to collect musical notes in order to fill up a meter till it shows five note icons. The stages will keep looping until the player fills up this meter, and the spots where the musical notes the player already collected will change into enemy combatants, making each additional loop through a stage more difficult than the previous one. At the point when the meter is filled, the players ship will be warped to the stage boss, which in this game are large musical notes. <br><br>After completing the game two additional modes are unlocked. These modes let the player select any stage they want. In the B.G.M mode, the stages are free of enemies and players can fly through them and create music without enemy harassment. The other mode is called the Music Maker mode. This mode allows players to create and edit their own soundtracks.",
