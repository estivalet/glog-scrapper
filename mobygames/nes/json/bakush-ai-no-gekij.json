  "description": "In <i>Bakush?!! Ai no Gekij?</i>, you create one to four characters. You choose their name and gender, as well as their parents (from several available ones). This determines the personality and the abilities of your characters (their intelligence level, physical condition, etc.). You then guide your teenager characters through a series of typical events. For example, at the beginning you'll be in school and will have to solve simple mathematical exercises. After that, you are presented with a calendar, which is your board in the game. You cannot control the actions of the characters, but depending on the way you have created them, and on the day the game will randomly choose for you, events will occur in their life, some of which are completely ordinary (like going out and meeting someone), while others will grant your characters more intelligence, physical condition, or let them earn or spend money. The game will also determine what personal relationship the characters will have with each other, and whether a romantic involvement is possible.",
