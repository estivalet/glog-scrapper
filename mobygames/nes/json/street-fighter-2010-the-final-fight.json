  "description": "The player is Ken, the hero of the <i>Street Fighter</i> series. It's been 25 years since he last participated in a fighting tournament. He has become a scientist and has developed a powerful medicine together with his friend Troy. But an unknown fiend breaks into his laboratory, kills Troy, and steals the invention. It's time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!<br><br>Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the <i>Street Fighter</i> or the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Final+Fight\">Final Fight</a> games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.",
