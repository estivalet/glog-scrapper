Run and time the jump to clear the bar. The higher the bar the faster the high jumper needs to run. <br>\n<b>Vaulting Horse</b> - There are a few different vaults the vaulter can do, some requiring a certain run up speed to do well. After the vault the vaulter is given a score based on the speed of approach and the vault performed. <br><br><br><b>Special Program:</b> <br>\n<b>Marathon</b> – Part 5<br><br><b>Program 6:</b>  <br>\n<b>4X100-Meter Relay</b> – All four different swims put together.
