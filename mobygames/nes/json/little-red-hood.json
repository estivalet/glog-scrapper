  "description": "Little Red wants to get to Grandma's house but there are mean creatures in the forest. Help guide Little Red to her Grandma.<br><br><i>Little Red Hood</i> is loosely based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Walk Red around the screen until a random staircase appears. Walk onto this staircase to enter the area where you may find a candy that will refill one heart, hearts that increase your heart count, crowns that are money and, maybe, the key. You need the key and must keep entering staircases until you find it. Once you have the key, you must kick trees to get fruits. You need ten fruits to make a special staircase appear. Enter this stair to exit to the next level. Above ground, you will encounter goblins that, if they touch you, remove one heart and Bear and Big Bad Wolf who kill instantly. Below ground, you will find hedgehogs and snakes that remove one heart. If you touch a Bear, Big Bad Wolf or lose all your hearts, you lose a life. Lose all lives and the game is over. At the top of the above ground screen, there are shops that sell invincibility potions, hearts and slingshots. The heart restores one heart, the potion makes you invincible for a time and the slingshot lets you kill goblins until it runs out. Also, above ground, are rocks that, when kicked, may give you candies or hearts or release an enemy.",
