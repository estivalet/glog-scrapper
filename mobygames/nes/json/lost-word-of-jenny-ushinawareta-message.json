  "description": "This game features Takara's fashion doll JeNnY. JeNnY is going to perform in a musical that involves the tale of Cinderella. However a member of the Bibi Order steals her script and now she has to get it back.<br><br><i>Lost Word of JeNnY: Ushinawareta Message</i>  starts out with JeNnY outside on a street. This area acts as a hub world where JeNnY has to enter and complete six areas before finally entering the musical theater.  The six areas are Batora's Tower, Ghost Mansion, Flowerland, Gabacho The Ship, Monster's House, and the Milkyway Fantasy. JeNnY's objective in these areas are to find a letter, a number, and to collect a key so she can use it to enter the next area. JeNnY will be attacked by each area's inhabitants, but she can defend herself by kicking and punching, and also by using a limited amount of spray. She can also find things such as necklaces which grant temporary invulnerability and bottles to replenish her health bar. After she completes an area she has to enter a Cow Head stage where she has to defeat the guardian(s) in order to leave. After that she will play a bonus game (similar to a slot machine) with Whomanchun. Whomanchun is a fortune teller and can give JeNnY bonuses if she gets specific numbers. When she finally enters the musical, she'll be asked what the number is that correctly matches the letter in the area they appeared together in. ",
