  "description": "The story of the game follows Yagy? J?bei (the historical Yagy? J?bei Mitsuyoshi was actually one of the most famous samurai in feudal Japan), starting the intro with a baby J?bei being left to the care of the village where the game begins. From here on out, the plot unfolds in a traditional Japanese RPG manner, involving a coming-of-age story with some world-saving in the mix. The game is divided into ten chapters, each portraying a different character, with all of them eventually coming together towards the end.<br><br><i>Juvei Quest</i> is a Japanese-style role-playing game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Dragon+Quest\">Dragon Quest</a> series. It follows the usual pattern of walking around villages, having an overworld map and several dungeons to explore, while also featuring a very similar battle system. Stand-out features include the use of maps that lead to hidden treasures, being able to recruit helper characters that can do useful tasks such as deactivating traps, and the ability to essentially purchase extra item slots. Among the more familiar elements are the turn-based battles, lots of different equipment to buy and find, and a vast array of different abilities from all party members (the game uses a skill system, instead of typical magic points for using special abilities).",
