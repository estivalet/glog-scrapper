Two contestants play a version of tic-tac-toe, with &quot;celebrities&quot; filling in for the squares. The selected celeb is asked a question, answers it, and the contestant must agree or disagree with their answer. A correct guess captures that square.  After three games, the winning contestant picks a key and a car out of two separate pools, hoping to match the two up and win the car.",
