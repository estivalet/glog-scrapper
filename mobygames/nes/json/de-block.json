  "description": "<i>De-Block</i> is a puzzle game that can be most easily explained as a 4-way <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a>. The player controls a block in the center of the screen which can move and rotate freely. Larger blocks move inward from each side of the screen and attach to the center block, then change color depending on their distance from the center. If the player completes a colored ring, that layer and all the blocks inside of it are cleared, and all the ones outside are moved inward. Play ends if a newly-appearing block overlaps with the player's structure.",
