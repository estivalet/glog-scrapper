  "description": "<i>Blow'em Out!</i> is a homebrew game that is the first in the developer's <i>Holiday</i> series of holiday themed homebrew games. The idea was that a physical version of this game could be gifted to a retro gamer for a birthday as the end of the game could be personalized to contain the recipient's name. The game consists of ten single, fixed screen levels. Each level contains a birthday cake with candles on it. To win a level a boy or a girl, chosen at the start of the game, needs to blow out all candles. The cake often has multiple layers (platforms) that can be reached by jumping. Sometimes there is also jelly that can be used to jump and reach a high area.<br><br>Some levels contain small floating flames that need to be avoided. These flames can also reignite some of the candles. The candles are put out by blowing, with a button press, and this can also be used to push the floating flames back.<br><br>The later Genesis version has upgraded music, more challenging enemies and the character can now drop down directly from a layer of birthday cake.",
