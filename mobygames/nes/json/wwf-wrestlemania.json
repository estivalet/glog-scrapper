  "description": "<i>WWF Wrestlemania</i> is a wrestling game using the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) license. The game features six popular WWF wrestlers:Hulk Hogan, André the Giant, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, The Honky Tonk Man, Bam Bam Bigelow, and &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase.<br><br>All the wrestlers can execute basic punches, kicks, and headbutts; turnbuckle moves and bodyslams can only be performed by particular wrestlers. Different wrestlers may use different moves with varying frequency, reflecting the preferences of their real-life counterparts. Wrestlers might also become angry (turning red on the screen), entering a rage state during which their attack power improves. Character-specific health power-ups will sometimes appear on the ring, and can be collected by corresponding wrestlers.<br><br>The two gameplay modes include a single exhibition match (one player versus the computer or two players against each other), and a tournament. In a single player tournament, the player chooses one wrestler and must defeat the other five in a series of matches to win the championship. In a tournament with up to six player-controlled wrestlers, each wrestler faces every other wrestler one time, for a total of fifteen matches. ",
