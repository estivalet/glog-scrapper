To spearhead the invasion, they have chosen Paul from Command Unit 88, also known as Iron Snake. To succeed in his mission, Paul will need all the firepower of the mightiest fighting vehicle, the Iron Tank. Iron Tank is played from an overhead view with a scrolling screen. You need to control the Iron Tank and its varied weapons and power-ups to rescue hostages and defeat enemy forces. ",
