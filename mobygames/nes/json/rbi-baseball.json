  "description": "Here's the baseball action that started it all - the one, the only, the original RBI. With permission from the Major League Players Association, this game uses the names and likenesses of real baseball players. This means the ten different teams in the Tengen league can have lineups that include baseball stars of the time; such as Reggie Jackson, Fernando Valenzuela, and Willie McGee. Stats and abilities have been structured to give each player strengths and weaknesses he had in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. You'll have to use your knowledge of real players and teams to manage your lineup effectively.<br><br>The teams you can choose from include Detroit, California, Houston, San Francisco, and even the American and National League All-Star teams. In One-Player mode you compete with the computer for the pennant in a nine game season. If you want to go head-to-head with a friend, you can each pick your favorite team and then compete in your own best-of-seven series.",
