  "description": "Director <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Masanobu+Endo\">Masanobu Endo's</a> original vision for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mobile+Suit+Z+Gundam+Hot+Scramble\">Mobile Suit Z Gundam: Hot Scramble</a> contained only the first-person shooting segments, but this version performed poorly in playtesting, leading to significant revision for the retail release. This original version of the game was still made available as a contest prize with reportedly only 1,000 physical copies being printed.<br><br>Compared to the retail release the paradoxically named <i>Final Version</i> has several changes:<ul>\n<li>Complete absence of all side-scrolling stages. Instead of ending with boarding a space station or battleship stages simply end once all enemies have been destroyed.</li><br>\n<li>Only TITANS mecha appear as enemy units. The game also has a different intro to reflect the absence of Neo-Zeon mecha.</li><br>\n<li>A more complicated UI that has an enemy radar</li><br>\n<li>Enemies on ground maps are more aggressive and attack in greater number, but there are no items on the ground nor do ground maps transition into space maps.</li></ul>",
