  "description": "Tiger Heli is the name of your helicopter, according to the box the result of a billion-dollar defense project and forged from ebony metal and glistening chrome. Your goal is to defeat the country of Cantun, which is run by terrorists and has become completely power hungry with an aim to take over the whole world.<br><br>You're shooting tanks, ships, aircraft carriers and trains while flying towards the impenetrable military base. You shoot crates to get pickups. If you shoot the crate when it is green you get a bomb pickup, if you shoot it when it is red you get a mini helicopter that attaches to one of your sides shooting sideways, and if you shoot it when it is white you get a mini helicopter shooting forward. If you shoot 10 crates with a yellow diamond shape you get an extra life.",
