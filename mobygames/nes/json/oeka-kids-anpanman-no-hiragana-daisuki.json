  "description": "The game is based on a popular animé series for children. The hero Anpanman is the son of the baker Jam-ojisan. His head is made entirely out of bread and bean jam. He rescues starving creatures, to whom he gives parts of his head to eat, and fights the evil Baikinman (&quot;Germ Man&quot;) and his minions.<br><br>This game contains five mini-games, some of which have educational purposes. The game is controlled entirely by a special mouse-like device which is shipped with it. The mini-games are:<ul><li>Try to catch the apples Anpanman drops from the sky by running around a small field.</li><br>\n<li>Combine puzzle pieces together to create images of the animé's characters.</li><br>\n<li>Practice to write Japanese syllables (hiragana) with the help of Anpanman.</li><br>\n<li>Figure out the differences between similar pictures.</li><br>\n<li>Uncover characters' faces by clicking on empty spaces on a board. Uncovering an enemy's face will make you fail (a concept not unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Minesweeper\"> Minesweeper</a>).</li></ul>",
