  "description": "Another day at <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Nekketsu+High\">Nekketsu High</a>, another gang tournament... but this time its different! A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.<br><br>The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Nekketsu+High\">Nekketsu High</a> games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses ",
