  "description": "Platformer based on the fairy tale &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;. Stages progress from the ground to a beanstalk, the clouds, an airship and the giant's castle. Some stages scroll vertically rather than horizontally, for example when scaling the beanstalk. Various items can be found that increase Jack's jump height or bean-throwing attack.",
