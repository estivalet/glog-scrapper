  "description": "In this 3D dungeon RPG that plays in the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Wizardry+games\">Wizardry</a> style, you play as a three character party and you may choose from different classes at the beginning of the game, each with different stats and growth progression. During battles, enemies are positioned on top and allies on the bottom of the screen. When you choose to attack,  the characters impact physically with each other and  there is small animations when magic is used. Maximum of three enemies are displayable, two small ones and a medium sized one.<br><br>The game is a pioneer in the &quot;RPG tool creation&quot; genre, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rpg-maker\">RPG Maker</a>. There is an edit mode that allows you to edit some aspects of the game. For example you may choose a soundtrack (such as sci-fi or fantasy), or even create your own dungeons (max 8 of them) with enemies and treasure chests. In this edit mode you can also edit items stats, characters' aesthetics (just slight modifications from predefined sets), and stats of enemies. You may even change messages displayed in town shops and what's displayed during the opening and the ending.",
