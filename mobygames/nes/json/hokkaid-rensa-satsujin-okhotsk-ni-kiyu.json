  "description": "In <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,50434/\">Yuji Horii's</a> follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/portopia-renzoku-satsujin-jiken\">The Portopia Serial Murder Case</a>, you once again play as a Tokyo police detective (whose name you assign) charged with solving a mysterious murder.  This time, your initial investigation of a dead body found floating in Tokyo Bay quickly leads you to follow the trail of clues to Hokkaido.  There, assisted by local police officer Shunsuke &quot;Shun&quot; Saruwatari, you will visit numerous popular real-life tourist attractions as you attempt to puzzle out the truth behind an ever-expanding series of murders.<br><br>While maintaining the same first-person adventure format, this game drops the parser-driven interface used in earlier versions of the preceding title, instead introducing the menu system which was to become typical of Japanese adventure games.  The player selects from a number of simple commands (Go, Ask, Take, Show, Photograph, etc.) to find new evidence and advance the plot; also, the &quot;Examine&quot; command can (and sometimes must) be used to point at and examine specific spots in the scene pictured, so that the interface is not solely text-based.",
