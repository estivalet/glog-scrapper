  "description": "Out beyond, in the galaxy of Tetrenova, a war has been fought that has exhausted resources and even worlds. The survivors band together and look for a new place to rebuild. They choose a seemingly undeveloped planet, Earth.<br><br>Using your defense ship 'Syd,' you must destroy the invading forces and ground targets with bombs. Obtain power-ups to gain energy for ship upgrades that allow you to transform to a more powerful machine. The game itself is a vertical shooter, moving continuously up towards the top of the screen.",
