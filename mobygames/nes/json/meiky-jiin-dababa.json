  "description": "Somewhere in India, there live thousands upon thousands of monks. One of them, in particular, is seemingly enjoying the most serene life he could. He lives with his lover, and life couldn't be finer... but things don't always go the way you planned in India. One day, an evil demon kidnapped his girl, and locked her up deep in the temple of Dababa. No time for serenity - it's time to hop, skip and jump to her aid quick, before bad things happen!<br><br>In <i>Meiky? Jiin Dababa</i>, a single player controls an Indian monk bent on recovering his girlfriend from the Dababa labyrinth. The player must negotiate his/her way through Dababa by jumping from one tile to the next. In most stages, hopping on the tiles containing seals will uncover them, and when all the seals are uncovered, the gateway to the next stage will unlock. Along the way, the player must not only watch out for enemies that can also jump tiles, but also trick doors that takes the monk back to earlier stages. The game is over when either the player loses his/her last monk or the monk's partner is recovered.",
