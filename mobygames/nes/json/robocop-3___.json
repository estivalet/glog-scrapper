  "description": "<i>RoboCop 3</i> for the NES is a platform shooter game starring the eponymous metal cyborg. This version is in many aspects similar to the version for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/robocop-3__\">8-bit computers</a> also developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Probe+Software+Ltd%2e\">Probe Software</a>: these games share level aesthetics and designs and musical score. However, the NES version is quite different: there's no first-person shooting level; instead, the first level is an exclusive side-scrolling stage. All levels feature slightly different designs, all bosses are redesigned as well, including the tank boss and final boss battle, in which Robocop has to do something entirely different than destroy the ninjas.
