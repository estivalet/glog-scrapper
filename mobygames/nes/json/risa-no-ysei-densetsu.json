  "description": "In <i>Risa no Yousei Densetsu</i> the player takes the role of a boy visiting a concert of popular Japanese idol, singer and actress Risa Tachibana. During the concert the sky darkens, lightning strikes and he and Risa get mysteriously transported into a fairy land, which is threatened by an evil witch and her minions. So starts their adventure to overcome the evil witch and find a way back to their own world.<br><br>The game is a typical menu-based console adventure game with verbs like &quot;speak&quot;, &quot;use&quot;, &quot;go&quot; or &quot;take&quot;, being the first menu choice, being followed by nouns in subsequent menus.<br><br>Through their journey the player and Risa visit a winter town and an enchanted forest. They must help underwater creatures against a vicious medusa and finally enter the castle of the evil witch herself. The game includes many references and characters from classic fairy tales. At some points during the game, a telephone number is shown, which (back in the day) players could use to retrieve information about what to do next.",
