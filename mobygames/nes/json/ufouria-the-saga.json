  "description": "Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions) is a penguin-like creature (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man) who finds himself in a strange world. He remembers that he and his three friends fell into a crater, and decides to find his friends before attempting to escape from the unknown world. He must explore this world and face many dangers, as well as deal with severe memory issues that have afflicted his companions.<br><br><i>Ufouria</i> is a side-scrolling platform game set in a free-roaming environment. The game's world comprises interconnected areas which consist of outdoor sections, caves, water, and other thematic places with platform structures and wandering enemies. Similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wonder-boy-iii-the-dragons-trap\">The Dragon's Trap</a>, the player is theoretically able to explore this world from the beginning; however, many areas are too hazardous or impossible to traverse when the player controls only one character with his limited abilities. <br><br>During the course of the game the player encounters the main hero's three friends, each of which becomes a controllable character. Each of these characters possesses special abilities that allow the player to access previously restricted areas. These abilities include swimming on the water's surface, walking on ice, jumping very high, and diving. The main character can also acquire a special item that will allow him to walk on walls.<br><br>All the characters attack by stomping on enemies, or by picking up balls left by defeated enemies and throwing them. In addition, each of the characters has his own &quot;secret weapon&quot;, which must be found in optional areas and is then equipped automatically and used by holding down a button. Other items include life containers, which increase the character's overall hit points, and medicines that heal a fixed amount of health. Game progress can be saved through a password feature.",
