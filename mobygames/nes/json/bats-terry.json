  "description": "<i>Batsu &amp; Ter?</i> is a side-scrolling platformer based on the manga of the same name. The player controls either Batsu (Bats), who throws baseballs to defeat enemies or Ter? (Terry), who swats at his opponents using a baseball bat. Player's health on the left of the screen is represented by baseballs (when playing as Batsu) or bats (when playing as Ter?). The game is started with one health point but it can be increased up to five by killing enemies. If you have at least two health points you can change between the two heroes by pressing the jump and select buttons together. Destroying certain blocks can reveal heart icons (collect 100 to gain a 1UP) or POW which increases weapon power. The goal is to simply reach the end of the stage before the timer runs out. The game consists of six worlds, with four stages per world.",
