  "description": "It turns out that Bullwinkle is the lost Earl of Moosechester and an inheritance is awaiting him in England. Now, Bullwinkle and his flying squirrel pal Rocket J. Squirrel have to travel from their home of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota all the way to England to claim this inheritance. To complicate matters, Rocky and Bullwinkle's antagonists Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale intend to impede their progress so they can claim the fortune for themselves.<br><br>The game consists of five episodes (stages) of side-scrolling platform action. Players can switch control on the fly to either Bullwinkle or Rocky and will have to do this as each character has their own unique abilities. While both characters can jump and throw bombs, only Rocky possesses the ability to fly while Bullwinkle can charge enemies with his antlers.<br><br>",
