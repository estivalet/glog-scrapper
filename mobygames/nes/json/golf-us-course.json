  "description": "A companion title to the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Family+Computer+Golf%3a+Japan+Course\">Japan Course</a>, <i>Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course</i> focuses on American courses. As such, gameplay is similar, with players choosing clubs and the speed at which they hit the ball. Once again, you control Mario and Luigi. Like the original, the game was compatible with the Disk Fax, so players could send their saved games and high scores to Nintendo. The gameplay influenced the later <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes-open-tournament-golf\">NES Open Tournament Golf</a>, and many Mario sports games have been made since.",
