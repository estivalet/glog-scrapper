  "description": "<i>19: Neunzehn</i> is a strategy game in which the player takes the role of one of four leaders in his fight for the possession of an ancient artifact, a stone left behind by the Olympian gods. The player can choose between one of the four leaders, which represent &quot;mountain&quot;, &quot;forest&quot;, &quot;sand&quot; and &quot;water&quot; each starting in their respective environment of the overworld map. Troops of each faction have different values in stats like melee or long-range attack and movement. When it comes to battle the screen changes to a single-screen hexagonal battlefield map. You have a certain amount of action points for each of your units. After you have determined your actions, the game executes each command simultaneously, so it is important for the player to anticipate his opponent's moves beforehand. By winning battles, your surviving troops get experience, eventually leading to a troop upgrade, which increases stats.",
