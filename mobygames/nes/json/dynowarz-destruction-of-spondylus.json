  "description": "This is a game of combat between giant mechanized dinosaurs named robosaurs in a faraway solar system named Spondylus. Mad robosaurs have overrun the planets of this man-made solar system and it is up to Professor Proteus to take the controls of the #1 robosaur, the Cyborasaurus. The goal is to get to the center of all 7 planets in this solar system and disable the artificially intelligent life support systems, which are guarded by progressively tougher defense.<br><br>Gameplay consists of getting into your robosaur, tromping across the surface of desolate planets in the solar system, fighting meaner robosaurs, and equipping better weapons along the way (you can launch your dino's fist!). Once you make it to the middle of each planet, you eject from the Cyborasaurus and head to the life support computer. Destroy the computer and get out fast.",
