  "description": "One day while nobody was looking, Baby Boomer climbed out of his crib and headed into the woods.  Little did he realize that while he's enjoying this adventurous journey into the unknown, there are many dangers awaiting him!  Your job is to use your Zapper to protect Baby Boomer and help him find his way home to his mother. Unlike other Zapper games, you can shoot just about anything you see in Baby Boomer.  Some things give extra points, while others give extra lives, open secret passages, control something in another part of the world or clear a safe route for Baby Boomer to follow.\n",
