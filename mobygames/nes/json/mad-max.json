  "description": "You are Mad Max. You drive your Interceptor through the post-apocalyptic wastelands and fight bandits.\nThe game introduction is the speech from the beginning of the movie Mad Max 2 (a.k.a The Road Warrior), telling you how the world ended and how The Road Warrior, lost everything by &quot;the roar of an engine&quot; and how he in the wastelands &quot;learned to live again&quot;.\nThe game is played in a top-down view where you move your car to attack enemy cars and pick up fuel tanks (if run run out of fuel the game is over).",
