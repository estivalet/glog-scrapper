  "description": "When this golf simulation was released in 1988 the U.S. National Video Game Team said it was &quot;by far the best video golf simulation available&quot;.<br><br>1 to 4 players can tee it up on either an 18 hole American course or an 18 hole Japanese course.  Players 1 &amp; 3 share controller 1 and players 2 &amp; 4 share controller 2.<br><br>Game modes are:<ul>\n<li>Stroke Play - The winner has the lowest number of strokes through 18 holes.\n<li>Nassau Game - The players compete against each other for points.  Presses are allowed.\n<li>Practice - A single player can practice on their favorite hole.</ul>\nSwing mechanics are: Press A to start the backswing, press A at the top of the swing, press A at impact. High and low shots can be selected by pressing up or down on the control pad. Right after contact another quick press of the A button at the same time as left or right will apply backspin to the ball. Complete club selection is available with the B button.  <br><br>Terrain includes tee, green, fairway, out-of-bounds, water, sand (light and hard), and rough (super, light, heavy and deep).<br><br>There are four available characters:<ul>\n<li>Pretty Amy - Slow swing speed with fantastic ball control and accurate aiming.\n<li>Big Jumbo - Powerful stroke and a long hitter but good technique is needed to control his shots.\n<li>Super Mex - All-around player with average distance, accuracy and swing speed.\n<li>Miracle Chosuke - Less power than Super Mex but good at putting and unequalled accuracy.  He can hit a &quot;Reverse Miracle Putt.&quot;</ul>",
