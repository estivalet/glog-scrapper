  "description": "<i>Ch?jin Sentai Jetman</i> is based on the Japanese TV show which resembles the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Mighty+Morphin+Power+Rangers\">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</a>.<br><br>The game was developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Natsume+Co%2e%2c+Ltd%2e\">Natsume</a> and plays quite similar to their other title - <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/shatterhand\">Shatterhand</a>. It is a side-scrolling action game where the player has to shoot, kick, jump and duck to overcome a plethora of baddies. Before the player selects a stage, they have to select one of five heroes, each with their own amount of health and weapon type. They also have a limited use special attack that can clear the screen of enemies. At the end of each level the hero jumps inside a giant robot and engages in a one-on-one duel with the boss of that level. <br><br>The game features four difficulty levels (two of which are hidden),  a password system, and a &quot;Battle mode&quot; in which the player can practice fighting against any of the bosses.<br><br>",
