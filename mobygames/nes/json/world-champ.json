  "description": "<i>World Champ</i> is a boxing game that has many similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Data+East\">Data East</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ring-king_\">Ring King</a>. You can play a one player &quot;Ranking&quot; mode, where you can build your boxer's stats up while climbing the ladder to eventually challenge for a championship in one of the four weight classes. There is also a two player vs. mode where you and a friend can square off. A tournament mode allows up to 8 players participate in a bracketed tournament.<br><br>Gameplay consists of each boxer moving around the ring trying to land jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. The goal is to either knock your opponent out for a 10-count or have the most points on the scorecard at the end of the allotted amount of rounds.",
