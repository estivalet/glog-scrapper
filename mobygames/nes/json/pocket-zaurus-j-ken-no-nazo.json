  "description": "Players take on the role of Hashimoto, a studious human boy who gets transformed into a dinosaur by one of the kings of the realm of the undead. Now it's up to the Hashimoto-Zaurus to travel through time, collect swords from the other kings which are needed to break the curse put on him, and also defeat the king who caused all this trouble in the first place.<br><br>The game takes place throughout six stages. The majority of the gameplay involves platforming action. Hashimoto is equipped with boomerangs that he can throw at his enemies to dispatch them. Hashimoto can also equip armor by collecting the super shield power-up. This allows him to throw more boomerangs at a faster pace. Sometimes Hashimoto will enter his flying time capsule and then the game will turn into a scrolling shoot-'em-up. <br><br>Gameplay will occasionally be interrupted in order to give the player a quiz question. If the player chooses the correct answer, the player will earn points which are added to their overall score.<br><br> The game features two difficulty levels.",
