  "description": "A couple is getting married at a wedding chapel, but the wedding is ruined when a bat comes over and turns the groom into a frog. The two dwarfs from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/don-doko-don\">Don Doko Don</a> are called in, and are told that they must find a potion that will turn the groom back to his human self.<br><br>To do this, you must go through five lands infested by wildlife. Like the original game, you are equipped with a mallet, which can be used to smash enemies. You can then pick these enemies up and toss them at others. When you do this, they leave behind a gem that can be collected for points. During your travels, you can break open chests that contain goodies such as scrolls, extra energy, and more weapons. <br><br>You exit an area by entering through an open doorway, but some doors are locked and must be opened with a key. At the end of each land, you encounter a boss that requires quite a number of hits to kill before you can proceed to the next land.\n",
