  "description": "The boy Michimune and the girl Miu happily live in a small house together with their wise old grandfather. One day, just when they were about to celebrate Miu's birthday, the room suddenly became dark, and an evil demonic figure appeared out of nowhere. Ironically, the dark being addressed your grandfather, saying it's been a long time. Apparently, grandfather also knew who or what this figure was, since he called him by the name <i>Rosenkreuz</i>. Rosenkreuz explains that he has waited a hundred years, but now it is possible to bring back the God of Evil, and to control the world! But for an unknown reason, he needs Miu. Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: &quot;Save... Miu...&quot;. And thus, Michimune embarks on a dangerous journey to the land of evil, to save Miu from the clutches of Rosenkreuz.<br><br>&quot;Seirei Gari&quot; is a horror-themed adventure game along the lines of the more known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/uninvited\"> Uninvited</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/deja-vu-a-nightmare-comes-true\"> Deja Vu</a>.
