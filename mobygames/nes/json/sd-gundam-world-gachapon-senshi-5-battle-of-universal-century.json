  "description": "This is the final installment of the <i>SD Gundam World</i> series to be released on the Famicom. The objective of the game is to conquer both Earth and space, by leading your army into battle against groups of rival armies.<br><br>There are 10 preset scenarios in the game, each with a specified number of teams and a time limit to get the objectives done. (The player can also choose a Free Scenario.) Once a scenario is chosen, and game settings are set (all settings can be changed in Free Scenario mode), the player and computer take turns navigating units through a series of menus, in the hopes of gaining enough force to occupy a locale. Once a locale is captured, the player who took it over gains money which can be used to bolster their units. The first player to capture all 21 areas (or the player further ahead when time is up) wins the scenario.<br><br>A battery-backed memory allows players to save their progress and return to the game at a later time.",
