  "description": "<i>Namida no S?koban Special</i> as the title suggests is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Soko-Ban+variant\">Soko-Ban variant</a>. The game features a game mode, puzzle mode, and an edit mode.<br><br>Game mode features several different soko-ban puzzles. Like the typical soko-ban game, this one features a warehouse worker trying to push crates onto designated spots on a warehouse floor. However, this game features a twist to the typical soko-ban gameplay.  Moving certain boxes can reveal items that get added to the player's inventory. Items include things such as magnets which can allow the player to pull boxes instead of being only allowed to push them. Players start each puzzle with a score and each step they take decreases their score.<br><br>Puzzle mode is similar to Game mode except items are no longer available. The score is kept by counting every step the player takes.<br><br>Edit mode lets aspiring game designers create and play their very own soko-ban puzzles.",
