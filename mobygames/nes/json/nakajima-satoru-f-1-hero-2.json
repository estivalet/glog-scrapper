  "description": "An F-1 racing title featuring three game modes. The Warming Up mode lets the player practice five laps on one of the sixteen tracks by themselves. Battle mode lets the player compete against another player or a computer controlled driver in a split-screen race (lasting from between one to ten laps depending on the length selected). Players can also watch a race between two computer controlled drivers. Grand Prix mode is the game's career mode. In this series of races, players must first run a fast enough qualifying lap to enter a race. The top four fastest qualifying results are the ones that are chosen to compete. After the four cars finish a race they each receive points depending on what place they finished in. These points keep getting added to the drivers total points tally. Having the most total points after a series of races is the ultimate goal.<br><br>There are four F-1 cars that are available to drive. Three have manual transmissions (requires shifting of gears while racing) while one is automatic. They each have individual ratings in power, acceleration, and traction.<br><br>",
