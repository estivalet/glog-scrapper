  "description": "<i>Hanjuku Hero</i> is a real-time strategy RPG game. A king used the power of a mysterious egg to unify a continent. However, he suddenly died a day after the unification, and the countries subjected to his rule revolted. The king's heir, the young prince must work with those few still loyal to the king and learn to use the power of the egg to bring order back to the continent.<br><br>You have to journey throughout the continent with your allies to try and capture enemy castles. Upon reaching a castle, a battle will begin. Battles can also occur in the field. You have no control over these battles, as the stronger team usually prevails. Traditional RPG elements such as HP and money are present. The game has a humorous edge to it, featuring Japanese puns.",
