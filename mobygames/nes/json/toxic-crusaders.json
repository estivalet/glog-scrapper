That is, until Killemoff captures all of the Toxic Crusaders save one. As Toxie, you must &quot;mop up&quot; Killemoff's forces through 6 levels and rescue his comrades before it's too late.<br><br>The game is action-oriented. Toxie's only abilities are to jump and to punch his way through enemies. He initially starts with a mop weapon, which can be easily lost. ",
