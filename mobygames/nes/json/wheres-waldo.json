  "description": "Waldo has a ticket to the Moon and needs the players help to get him to his destination.<br><br>Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books. Your goal is to find Waldo in various pictures in order to progress through the game.<br><br>The pictures are still images the size of the screen in the Easy and Practice levels. In the Medium and Hard levels, the player has to scroll to the side to see the rest of the area.  The directional buttons control a magnifying glass and once the player finds Waldo, they get to go to the next level and a new picture.<br><br>In the Practice difficulty level, there is no time limit but only the Train Station, Forest and Caves levels are available. The time limit for the other difficulty levels varies: Easy=959, Medium=659, and Hard=459.",
