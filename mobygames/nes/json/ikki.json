  "description": "In <i>Ikki</i>, players take the role of Gonbe (and his friend Tago if there is a second player), who are farmers living in medieval Japan.  They are currently involved in an uprising against their feudal lord. The feudal lord has dispatched his army of ninjas to put a halt to this revolt. <br><br>Gameplay is viewed from a top down perspective. Players get to explore four different locations (stages) searching for gold coins (kobans)  that are spread out across the land. Every gold coin has to be collected for the player to move on to the next stage. While searching for the coins, players have to deal with the enemy ninjas and other minions of the land who want to harm them. Players can defend themselves by throwing scythes at any incoming opponent. They can also pick up items such as a bamboo spear for an additional weapon, plus find items that can increase speed of movement, and an item that will give the player an extra life.<br><br>There is also an item that will give the player a chance at a bonus round between stages. In the bonus round, players have to catch falling rice (onigiri) being thrown at them from above. Catching the rice adds bonus points to the player's score while catching all ten onigiri will grant the player a bonus life.",
