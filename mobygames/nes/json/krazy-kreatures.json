  "description": "Krazy Kreatures is an action strategy game for one or two players. Critters of all sorts will fill up the game board and you need to move them around to line up creatures of the same type before the entire board becomes filled. Depending on the type of creature, you will need to line up 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the same type of creature for them to disappear. After you have cleared a certain number of creatures, the board will stop filling up and you have a limited amount of time to try to clear as many creatures as possible for bonus points. As the levels progress the game board changes shape and will fill up faster and faster with different creatures.",
