  "description": "October 1st, 1997 is known as END DAY. A great war encircles the globe and brings about an end to civilization. The surviving humans concluded that they could never repeat their mistakes and build a great tower in the sky to watch over the world and act accordingly to combat &quot;evil&quot;. One hundred years have passed since then and a hidden cryogenic chamber in the mountains springs to life...<br><br><i>Crystalis</i> is a top-down action role-playing game. Starting from the cryogenic chamber, the player takes the role of a mysterious hero who must uncover the mystery of the tower. The character may equip weapons, armor, shields and globes or bracelets on his body and a single item from his inventory for use in the field. To aid the hero on his quest, four wise people will gradually teach him offensive and healing magic, which requires MP to use. <br><br>The protagonist will also obtain four elemental swords which will help him progress. Each sword can be charged for a powerful ranged attack; if special items are found, this attack can be enhanced for two additional levels. The hero gains experience and gold from defeating monsters. The experience is used to gain levels and improve statistics, however a minimum level is required before one can do damage to specific bosses. Gold is used to purchase items in shops.",
