You play as Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only she is red.<br><br>Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed.<br><br>To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.<br><br>There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.",
