Take on MiGs, AAA, and SAM, and the unforgiving nature of carrier aviation. Configure each plane's loadout for your mission, plan your mission package, then fly your missions. Command multiple sections of planes and switch among them at will. When you're done, you can even try your hand at LANDING on an aircraft carrier. ",
