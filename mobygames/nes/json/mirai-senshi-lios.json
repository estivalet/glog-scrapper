  "description": "<i>Mirai Senshi: Lios</i> is a turn-based strategy game that takes place on the fictional planet Lios. The kingdom of Cecilia is being attacked by the evil Goinkia and his armies. You control Cecilia and her army of robots and must play through many maps to reach the evil Goinkia. Along the way you can visit castles and towns to get helpful advice by the townspeople. When in combat, the game is automatic, as you can only control your actions on the map screen. Your robots are given a limited supply of ammo and only one can be refiled each time it's your turn. If you lose, you are given another chance, but if you win, you will gain powerups for your robots. You can also save your game after winning. On the overworld screen you can several different routes to get to Gionkia's castle.",
