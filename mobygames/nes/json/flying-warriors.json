  "description": "<i>Flying Warriors</i> is a combination between the Japanese exclusive games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Hiry%c5%ab+no+Ken+II%3a+Dragon+no+Tsubasa\">Hiry? no Ken II: Dragon no Tsubasa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hiry-no-ken-iii-go-nin-no-dragon\">Hiry? no Ken III: Go-nin no Dragon</a>.<br><br>The game is about a team of superheroes called the Flying Warriors who have to fight a demon before he can take over the world with his armies of Tusk Soldiers. You start off with kung fu master Rick Stalker, but eventually get the help of Hayato Go, Mary Lynn, Greg Cummings and Jimmy Cutler. During the side scrolling portion of the game you can use your kung fu and mystic spells to dispose of enemies. Each enemy you defeat gives you experience points which will eventually increase your life points. There are some one on one duels during fighting tournaments that involve hitting a target on your opponents body while defending the target on your own body. There is also RPG-style command battles against bosses.<br><br>There is also a tournament mode, where up to 8 players can compete to win the championship. You can choose your characters fighting style from six different choices; kung fu, boxing, karate, wrestling, kick boxing, and martial arts.",
