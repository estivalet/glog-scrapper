  "description": "One of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Hudson+Soft\">Hudson Soft's</a> earliest NES titles, <i>Challenger</i> is an arcade-style game that combines side scrolling, run 'n jump action with overhead, exploratory gameplay. The game consists of two parts.<br><br>The first level (or &quot;scene&quot;) has you racing the clock to get to the front of a train, where a purple-faced villain is holding your significant other (or, perhaps just some anonymous princess). You have at your disposal a trusty throwing knife to take care of enemies. You will also have to dodge obstacles and jump gaps in the train. This section is taken from the earlier Hudson game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/stop-the-express\">Stop the Express</a>.<br><br>Scene 2 places you in an overhead, maze-like environment, where you once again have to fight the clock. This time though, you have to navigate your way through the area, in search of all the different &quot;keywords&quot;, which are placed in different caves. Once you have cleared all the caves, the path will be open to the boss' final lair.\n",
