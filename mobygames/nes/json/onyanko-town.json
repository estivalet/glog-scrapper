  "description": "In <i>Onyanko Town</i>, a kitten named Michael has wandered outside its house and has now gotten lost. Now, it's up to the kitten's mother, Milky, to search all over the town trying to locate the kitten and return it to their household. <br><br>The game is set in a town viewed from a top-down perspective. The player control the mother cat. The mother cat has the ability to jump and to open or close any manhole covers that are close by. While searching for the lost kitten, the mother cat is harassed by enemy dogs that want to harm her. There are other obstacles that the mother cat has to be wary of such as oncoming traffic, snakes, traffic cones, and open manhole covers which she can fall into if she is not careful. <br><br>The mother cat can become temporarily invincible from the dogs by eating a fish from one of the neighborhood markets, although this will cause the merchant to come out of the shop with a knife and give chase to the thieving cat. Another way to slow down the chasing dogs is to open a manhole cover so they fall down into the sewers. <br><br>Once the kitten is found, the mother cat has to drag it home, except now the mother cat loses the ability to jump and must be extra cautious on the way back home.<br><br>",
