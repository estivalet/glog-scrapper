  "description": "In <i>Ultimate Basketball</i>, the player can choose one of seven fictional teams that each have different skills such as having tight defense or a phenomenal passing game. Each team also has their own players who are given ratings on their quickness, shooting and defensive ability.<br><br>The point of view is horizontal for the most part. Occasionally, a close-up action scene is shown on plays such as slam dunks and free throws. There are also two different play modes, &quot;Tournament&quot; and &quot;One Game.&quot; Players can play alone, against a friend, or with a friend against the computer. There is also a &quot;Watch&quot; mode where players can view games being played by the computer against itself.",
