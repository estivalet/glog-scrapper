  "description": "<i>Bootèe</i> is a 2D platform game starring Cheril as the protagonist, a recurring character in many of the developer's games. One day Cheril hears about the three legendary stars of power. She grows curious and wants to find out more, when a strange man appears behind a huge pot. He tells her she needs help to reach the stars, but with a proper vehicle. The next thing she knows Cheril finds herself enclosed in a huge boot that leaps by itself. Before she has the chance to ask what to do next, it leaps away.<br><br>The game consists of several stages. Each stage is composed of several single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic, offering an amount of freedom to explore. To complete a stage Cheril needs to collect twenty coins scattered around the level. They can only be collected completing difficult platforming sections. The boot jumps by itself, so the player only steers left and right. The height of the jump can be made shorter however by pressing down.<br><br>Cheril can attack enemies by charging and releasing spit. This does not kill them, but pushes them away slightly. Enemies can be used as platforms by landing on top of them and this will alter their movement pattern. That way both techniques can be used to improvise with the level lay-out, getting enemies out of the way or in a favourable position. There are spikes to avoid and enemies cannot be touched from the side or below, or she loses a life. Cheril starts with five lives and additional ones are earned by picking up red hearts. Certain sections are locked and first require a key to be found.",
