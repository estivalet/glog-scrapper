On top of keeping all four wheels on the road, tire wear, damage, and fuel must be managed to secure victory. Stopping into the pit for maintenance at the right moment can mean the difference between victory and defeat. There are also 24 different cars to purchase with your winnings with varying attributes including speed, fuel efficiency, body strength, and tire endurance.<br><br>F1 Race was released as one of Nintendo's Disk Fax line of games. It came on a special blue disk and allowed players to submit their best times through special kiosks in various stores across Japan. Players with the best time were given a chance to win a Super Mario Bros. Game &amp; Watch LCD game.",
