  "description": "In the future there is a coliseum featuring automated fighting robots. It was created so a space civilization can research and develop its fighting machines.<br><br>Players can create up to eight of these metal soldiers to fight against each other in the combat arena. For each fighting machine, players are given up to 999 points to disperse it between fifteen different categories such as the machine's speed, dexterity, armor, and jumping abilities. Each category costs a different amount of points to increase. <br><br>The players can also choose from seven different body types for their machine. The available body types include 2 Legs, 4 Legs, Snake, Hover, 3 Tire, 6 Tire, and a Belt type of body. Once the statistics for the machines are entered, the player(s) can now enter them into the arena and watch how their bots perform against the competition. The first machine to lose all of its hit points or fuel loses the match.",
