  "description": "<i>Adian no Tsue</i> features two educational math games.<br><br>The first game involves controlling a sorcerer named Lucian who is armed with a cane. He is on a mission to rescue Princess Patricia who is being held deep inside a dungeon labyrinth. Gameplay is viewed top down similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/legend-of-zelda\">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Players have to explore a dungeon maze dealing with enemies and solving basic math problems so that they can open locked doors to go further into the maze. Finding the right way to go will allow the player to explore more floors of the dungeon. There are nine floors in all.<br><br>The second game is called Step Drill in which players run a marathon. To get a good time on the marathon, players have to answer math problems as fast as they can.<br><br>The game was originally packaged along with a comic book. ",
