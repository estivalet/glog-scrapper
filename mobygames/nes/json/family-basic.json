  "description": "<i>Family BASIC</i> allowed users to program in a BASIC programming language (NS-HUBASIC) that was developed specifically for use on the Famicom. The cartridge came with a keyboard and required the use of the Famicom Data Recorder in order to save any created programs.<br><br>The cartridge was originally released as Family BASIC, but was later re-released as Family BASIC V3 with added memory. This version also came packaged with some games already included. Games are accessed by typing GAME followed by a space then a number (0, 1, 2, or 3).<br><br>The following are the games that were included:<br><br>GAME 0 is the Heart Game. Using either a microphone or the keyboard, players get to fill in a heart with Mario and Pauline (of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a> fame) meeting in the middle for a smooch.<br><br>GAME 1 is the Number Game. Players control a penguin on a grid collecting numbers in sequential order while trying to avoid the Sidesteppers from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/mario-bros\">Mario Bros.</a>.<br><br>GAME 2 is the Mario Game. Players are able to control Mario in game levels that they themselves make.<br><br>GAME 3 is Star Killer. 1 or 2 players control their spaceship trying to shoot as many enemies as they can.",
