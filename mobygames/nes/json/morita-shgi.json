  "description": "<i>Morita Sh?gi</i> is a Famicom adaption of the Japanese board game &quot;Sh?gi&quot;, which plays similar to chess. It is the second Sh?gi game released for the Nintendo Famicom in Japan. The game lets you choose from a couple of game modes. You can play a game against another human player or a CPU player which comes in three different difficulty levels. The game also gives you extensive editing options, giving you the opportunity to create a board setup of your liking, placing the Sh?gi pieces wherever you want. The game also lets a player interrupt a current game and go back and forth through the moves.",
