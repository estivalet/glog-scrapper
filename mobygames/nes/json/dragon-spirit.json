  "description": "Princess Alicia of the kingdom of Mitgult is kidnapped by the monster Zawell. It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess.<br><br><i>Dragon Spirit</i> is a  vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path.  Much like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xevious\">Xevious</a>, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground.  The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon.  Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.<br><br>Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight.  Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.<br><br>The NES version is unique in that it presents a somewhat altered story and an additional gameplay mode.  Technically, it is a sort of sequel, with &quot;A New Legend&quot; being its subtitle.  In this version, Zawell is already defeated and King Amul and his now wife Queen Alicia, have two children named Iris (a princess) and Lace (a prince). A new evil named Galda has decided to attack the Earth. Galda also has taken Iris captive and now Lace must go rescue her. <br><br>The NES version also adds a new initial stage.  If the player survives it, the game continues in a &quot;Blue Dragon&quot; game much like the original arcade game.  If the player fails to clear this initial stage in one life, an easy mode called &quot;Gold Dragon&quot; begins, skipping about half the game's stages, giving the player extra hit points, and features a different ending.<br><br>Also of note, the TurboGrafx-16 version's seventh and eighth stage are different than the other versions. The underwater and dark themed stages were changed to castle interior themed stages.",
