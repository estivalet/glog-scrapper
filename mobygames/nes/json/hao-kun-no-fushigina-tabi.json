  "description": "Once there lived a sorcerer's apprentice named Hao who, day after day, did every thankless task the Great Wizard asked him to do. Although he did them without so much as a complaint, he longed for the day where he finally would get an opportunity to prove himself. Now, that day has finally come. The Great Wizard has given Hao a task - recover six tailsmen located in six separate castles, and then he'll consider him a wizard. Is Hao up to the task?<br><br><i>Hao Kun no Fushigina Tabi</i> pits a single player controlling Hao against 6 worlds of perilous obstacles, malicious enemies, and devious mazes. Within those 6 worlds, Hao must find the six tailsmen (once per world) while negotiating the dangers of the outside world, castles, or even underground dungeons. Along the way Hao can give himself more of an advantage by grabbing various items that can either help Hao uncover new passages or give him magical powers. But the items are placed in seemingly unreachable places, so Hao had better keep his eyes peeled.<br><br>The game is over if Hao either runs out of health or falls into water without a SOS item present... or if he successfully recovers the six tailsmen.",
