  "description": "<i>Karaoke Studio</i> is a Karaoke based video game where the player sings along to a selection of songs with the help of a microphone peripheral that came with the game and was attached directly to the game cartridge. The game features a total of fifteen songs, each of them presented in a graphical sequence and with the song's text displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game features four different game modes. The first mode is a &quot;Lesson&quot; mode, where the player can freely choose a song to practice. In the second mode, the player performs on a theater stage to win a cup. The third mode is a sort of career mode, where the player has to sing in front of judges. The fourth and last mode is a quiz game, presenting the player glimpses of songs, which they have to guess correctly.",
