  "description": "Captain Hook and his army of brute pirates would like nothing better than to overtake Neverland with their corruptive ways. Peter Pan, with the help of Tinkerbell and a little Pixie Dust, will attempt to stop Captain Hook once and for all by making him walk his own gangplank.<br><br>The player controls Peter, whose weapon is a sword. You start with 3 lives and you can increase your life meter by collecting treasure chests or Tinkerbell fairies throughout a level. You also can collect bags of fairy dust to temporarily fly. You must defeat all the pirates present on one level to get to the next level.",
