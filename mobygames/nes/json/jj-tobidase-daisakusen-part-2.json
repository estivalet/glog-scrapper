  "description": "<i>JJ - Tobidase Daisakusen Part 2</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3-d-worldrunner\">3-D WorldRunner</a>, and was only released in Japan. Once again, the WorldRunner has to journey through different worlds and battle the Serpentbeasts that are terrorizing the people.<br><br>Among the dangers lurking in these worlds are mean alien creatures, columns of fire, bottomless pits and, of course, at the end of each level the Serpentbeasts themselves. Time is of the essence, and to succeed, the WorldRunner will have to learn not only how to battle his enemies, but above all how to elude them.<br><br>Whereas the first game used Anaglyphic 3D Glasses for it's 3D effect, this sequel takes advantage of the Famicom 3D System to handle it's 3D effects.",
