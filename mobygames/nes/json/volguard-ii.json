  "description": "<i>Volguard II</i> is a side-scrolling shooter that is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/volguard\">Volguard</a>. Players have to shoot their way through 25 areas in one of the four difficulty levels the game offers.<br><br>Players control a flying craft that has the ability to shoot both bullets and bombs, however bullets are only usable if the craft has enough power to do so. Players can also come across a mech attachment item which will allow them to turn their craft into a mech, which has the ability to walk on the ground and throw punches at enemies and structures. Players also have to keep a close eye on their energy counter. Every time their craft is hit, the counter goes up by 1. If the counter reaches 99, the game will end.\n",
