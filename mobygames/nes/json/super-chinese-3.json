  "description": "Aliens have taken over Chinaland and have taken the emperor hostage! Fortunately, the emperor's son managed to escape and tell the story of the land's sorry plight to Jack and Ryu, Chinaland's resident ninja masters. Now it's up to them to rescue the emperor and free Chinaland from alien invasion!<br><br><i>Super Chinese 3</i> is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two-player game, player 1 controls Jack and player 2 controls Ryu. In a one-player game, only Jack will be playable, but Ryu can join in at any time and share Jack's experience level. Both Ninja Boys share experience points so that they remain at the same level. <br><br>Jack and Ryu explore the world map in an overhead view. As with <moby game=\"Little Ninja Brothers\">the previous <i>Super Chinese</i> game</moby>, random encounters with monsters will give them the option to flee or to fight. While in combat (which takes place in a side-scrolling perspective or across multiple rooms), the players can use the control pad to move Jack or Ryu and the button to either punch or do a somersault jump to damage enemies. Additional power-ups can also be found during the course of battles. The combat ends when either side is out of hit points. Successfully defeating enemies awards experience points and Sen money, which can be spent in the convenience store of each town to increase abilities and buy new weapons. Some of these include throwing stars, special martial arts techniques, swords, projectile attacks and other special powers. Towns also contain people who will give clues and information to Jack &amp; Ryu.<br><br>When bosses are encountered, the game play changes to a turn-based system. In each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. Again, the battle ends when either side is out of hit points.",
