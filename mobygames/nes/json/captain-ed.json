  "description": "<i>Captain ED</i> is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. Players pilot a ship through seven different levels of outer space in order to rescue their friends from captivity and to defeat Doguma. Players must shoot down enemy ships to earn money. This money can then be used at the sporadically placed gas stations to refill their ships energy. Also, money can be spent at shops where the player can purchase various items. Items include weapon upgrades such as double lasers and missiles and more importantly key items that must be purchased before being allowed to complete a level.<br><br>Throughout each level are different colored tiles that are constantly moving. Flying over certain colored tiles reduces the ships energy, however certain tiles can be smashed open with the ship's equipped hammer. Smashed tiles reveal items that can be picked up such as coins which give the player more money and power-ups like invulnerability. The most important item to find in these locations is the Warp Drive. This item will warp the player to either a mini-game or more importantly a boss fight.<br><br>Mini-games can earn the player money. The mini-games include things such as a simple card games like High or Low and a game where the the objective is to play the drums by following a rhythm correctly. <br><br>Stage bosses take multiple hits to defeat. Once the player beats the seven stage bosses they are sent to the final stage to face down the final boss.<br><br>",
