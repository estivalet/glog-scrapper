  "description": "<i>Crime Busters</i> is a light gun game in which the player takes the role of a police officer and has to shoot bandits. The game consists of three stages: the street outside of a bank, a warehouse and the inside of a bank.<br><br>The first stage has the criminals appearing either at the windows or at the door of the bank. In stage two the player has to face ninjas who will appear behind obstacles, running from side to side of the screen or hanging from the ceiling; some ninjas will hold hostages that should not be shot. Shooting the lights in the ceiling will make the room darker. Stage three has bank robbers hidden behind obstacles or running from side to side; hostages also appear on this stage.<br><br>The player can choose a stage to start from. At first, the player has to shoot 20 enemies to progress to the next stage. Shooting all enemies sends the player to the next level with five more enemies to shoot. When all three stages are beaten, the game continues from the first stage selected. The player starts with 5 lives, which can be lost by taking three shots from the enemies or shooting hostages three times.",
