  "description": "<i>Koko Adventure</i> is a Korean-made platformer similar in style and presentation to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a>. The player controls a kid named Buzz or his partner, as they traverse predominantly outdoor areas with various themes (plains, forests, ice world, etc.). The protagonist does not use weapons and defeats enemies by performing a spinning movement. The same ability is also used to crush blocks from four directions. <br><br>The stages have a certain degree of non-linearity, since the objective in each of them (except boss battles) is to find and collect a certain number of keys; once the last one is collected, the level ends automatically. These keys are usually found on top of high platforms or in enclosed areas that can only be accessed through special teleporters. Power-ups include shoes that allow the hero to perform a double jump, and a feather that makes it possible to jump very high and float in the air for a while.",
