  "description": "<i>Stealth ATF</i> is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk in several missions.<br><br>In every mission's beginning and ending the player has to take off and land the plane respectively, from a side view. Failing to land after completing the target objectives means failing to succeed in mission and thus having to replay it.<br><br>The view during the flight is from inside the cockpit, and the gameplay offers total freedom of movement on flight. The terrain is infinite, and the enemies will re-appear on the radar every time they fly out of range. The player flies in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, the player can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.<br><br>The mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. The targets will always be aerial ones. The weapons available are a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) and missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots a missile, the player can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once the player passes out of the danger. If players manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and they have to try to take down as many enemies as they can.<br><br>The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.",
