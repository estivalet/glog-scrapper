The king needs you, the offspring of the brave warrior Mars, to go on a journey and to investigate the matter. During this investigation, you uncover a much more sinister plot and must face the dark forces of the world.<br><br>&quot;Chaos World&quot; allows you to customize your character by choosing one of the several classes, gender, and statistics (you can allocate available skill points at your wish in the beginning of the game).
