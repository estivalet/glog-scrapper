  "description": "Another game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Ninja+Jajamaru-kun+series\">Ninja Jajamaru-kun series</a>. Players once again take control of the little red ninja Jajamaru as he attempts to rescue Princess Sakura from the evil clutches of the Catfish Pirate and his minions.<br><br>The game mainly consists of side-scrolling platforming action throughout its ten stages. The goal is to get to the end of each side-scrolling stage before the time runs out. Players have the ability to jump and can attack enemies by throwing shurikens at them. Defeated enemies release souls which can be collected. Collecting 50 of these souls will give the player an extra life. Players can also pick up various power-ups, such as ones that give the player temporary invisibility, Jajamaru dolls that add a life to the players reserve, and even a power-up that lets the player ride a giant frog.<br><br>After every sidescrolling stage there is a bonus round stage fight where the player can earn bonus points by defeating the bosses of these stages.\n",
