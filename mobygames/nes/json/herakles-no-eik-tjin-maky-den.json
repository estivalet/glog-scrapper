  "description": "In this game, you play the role of Herakles (or <i>Hercules</i>, in Latin pronunciation), the famous legendary Greek hero. Starting in Athens and wandering all over ancient Greece (and even the mythical land of the dead), you'll have to fight many monsters, including popular figures from Greek mythology like Talos or Hades, and prove yourself worthy of a hero's fame.<br><br>The game is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dragon+Warrior\"> Dragon Warrior</a> series: you fight random enemies in turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, collect experience and money, and in towns talk to people and buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no world map in the game, but a continuous location complete with towns and dungeon-like areas. ",
