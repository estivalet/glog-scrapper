  "description": "<i>Dezaemon</i> is a game designing application that lets aspiring developers create their own vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up. Players have control over how their ship looks, design how their levels (up to three) will look, and also create a title screen. Players can also compose their own background music and create a list of credits to give credit to the designers of their game.<br><br>There is also a sample shoot-'em-up available to play titled <i>E.D.I.T.</i>. It contains 3 stages of a simple vertical-scrolling space shooter where players shoot down waves of enemies and fight a boss enemy at the end of each stage. Items can also be collected which can increase their ship's speed or give their ship a defensive shield. Other items can upgrade the ships' weaponry from a vulcan cannon to either lasers or missiles.
