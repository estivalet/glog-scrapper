  "description": "Science Patrol Officer Hayate, being a part of the Science Special Search Party, has a responsibility to defend earth from large hostile alien monster attacks. Well it's just his luck that the earth is under siege from all sorts of these monsters. Now it's up to Hayate and his fighting machine alter ego Ultraman to save the day.<br><br>The game features eleven different timed stages. The majority of stages involve Hayate shooting enemies in the hopes that they drop beta capsules or collecting any capsules he can find in a stage. Collecting these capsules will fill up a meter. When this meter is filled, the player can then transform Hayate into Ultraman. This is necessary as only Ultraman has the ability to defeat the large boss monster(s) that appear in each stage. However transforming into Ultraman leaves the player only three minutes to defeat the current stage he is on. The game also features a few horizontal scrolling shooter stages.<br><br>Defeating the game once, will then let the player play as Dan Moroboshi and his alter ego Ultra-Seven. The enemies in this mode take more hits to defeat.<br><br>After the game's original release, it was later re-released on a disk writer kiosk. The only difference in this later released version is that the some of the background music has been changed.\n",
