  "description": "The President of the United States has put you in charge of stopping  the trafficking of drugs into the United States. To accomplish this, you pilot a Firehawk helicopter gunship through seven missions that involve rescuing agents and destroying drug producing facilities. When flying you survey the whole landscape from a top down view. However, this view changes to a 3rd person perspective when you are extracting an agent with your helicopter winch.",
