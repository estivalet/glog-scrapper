  "description": "A follow-up to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Spy+vs%2e+Spy\">Spy vs Spy game</a> now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol)  and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs. <br><br>There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.",
