  "description": "<i>Blue Train Murder Murder Case</i> is based off of a book by Kyoutarou Nishimura with the same name, published in 1978, which was his first installment of railway mysteries. This adventure games starts with a murder incident on a blue train (in Japan, blue trains are long-distance sleeper trains named after their overall color), and you will switch controls between three different detectives in order to fully clarify the mystery. During your investigation there are no wrong choices which may result in your being killed or game over. You can take your time to go about the clues, investigate suspects and solve the mystery behind the murder.",
