But one day, minister Pumpkin betrayed king Broccoli, kidnapped princess Tomato, stole the royal Turnip Emblem, and took them to his castle in Zucchini mountains. He sent his cruel Farmies to terrorize the Salad Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, the king died, unable to recover from the loss of his beautiful daughter. But he promised you, the brave Sir Cucumber, the princess' hand and the entire kingdom, if you save the beautiful Tomato from the clutches of the evil Pumpkin. <br><br><i>Princess Tomato</i> is an adventure game in which the player interacts with the environment by choosing commands from a menu, such as the traditional &quot;check&quot; or &quot;give&quot;, and the less traditional &quot;praise&quot; or &quot;percy&quot;.
