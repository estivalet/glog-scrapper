  "description": "The Noid, the mascot from Domino's Pizza commercials during the 1980s, is in trouble. There is another Noid named Mr. Green, running through New York City playing practical jokes and causing trouble, but everyone is blaming the Noid for these shenanigans. Now the Noid must clear his name and save the city by catching this impostor.<br><br>It is another 2D jump and run platform for NES, but with a strange idea and cartoonish and cheerful graphics. The weird character has to beat pizza delivery boys using a yo-yo.",
