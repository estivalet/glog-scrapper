  "description": "<i>Espitenen und Herr Pimponen</i> is a fast-paced platform game based on the <i>Espinete's Big Trouble</i> demo previously featured in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mojonian-tales\">Mojonian Tales</a>. It stars the characters Espitenen (very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Espinete\">Espinete</a> character) and Herr Pimponen, with three game modes. The game can be played solo, going through the ten stages in a fixed order as one of the two characters, a cooperative two-player mode and a competitive two-player mode.<br><br>Each level consists of a large vertically oriented environment with platforms. The goal is to reach the top of the stage or to finish with most points. The characters start at the bottom and after the initial platforms the screen starts scrolling vertically at a fixed speed. If a character touches the bottom of the screen a life is lost right away. Quick jumping is required to keep progressing while collecting items for points. Both enemies can shoot in the opposite direction they are facing. They cannot hurt each other, but enemies can be taken out that way. The characters can however hinder each other, through bumping. When not touching the bottom of the screen a number of hits can be taken and health can be replenished by picking up red hearts. Levels have different themes and gameplay elements such as quicksand platforms or spikes. It is possible to jump through certain platforms while other are solid.",
