  "description": "While the game keeps the same story as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/knightmare-ii-the-maze-of-galious\">MSX version</a>, this version features some alterations. The number of dungeons has been reduced from ten to five, however the dungeons have been increased in size and feature redesigned layouts. Other differences include the game featuring a larger character sprite, scrolling instead of a flip-screen, and spell incantations are done with button presses instead of typing in words, among other changes",
