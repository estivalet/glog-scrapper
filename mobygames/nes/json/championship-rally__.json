  "description": "This unlicensed rally simulation was initially developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=hal-laboratory-inc\">Hal Laboratory</a> and released in Australia in 1991, then ported to the Famicom by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=kaken-corp\">Kaken</a> in 1992 under the title <i>Exciting Rally: World Rally Championship</i>.<br><br>The game is played from a top-down perspective, and the controls themselves are rather simple: button A allows you to drive at low speed, button B at a higher speed, and the down arrow doubles as brakes and reverse gear. Arrows will indicate some, but not all, turns, and you will have to keep an eye out for jumps and obstacles. Your car will accrue damage each time you bump into something, until it finally explodes and you have to retire from the stage.<br><br>Two game modes are available. You can drive through an entire championship with up to seven other human players. Three classes serving as a difficulty setting, and the competition will take you to ten different countries, where you will have to compete against the times set by AI (and possibly human) opponents across several stages.\nOr you can play against two to eight other players in the Battle mode, setting a time one after another on your selected stage.<br><br>There is some level of tuning, with the possibility of choosing your tyres according to the surface (tarmac, gravel or snow), whether you want a turbo, and between two and four-wheel drive for each stage. Once a lap, you can also change your tyres when the letters &quot;SP&quot; appear on the screen ; simply come to a stop and press Select.",
