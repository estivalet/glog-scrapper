  "description": "In <i>Auto-Upturn</i>, players are tasked with having to set right a scrambled picture in seven different rounds of play. Pictures are broken up into thirty different squares in a five by six square tile layout. Players control their avatar (it changes depending on the round) and pick up the tiles one at a time and place the tiles back in their proper place. Each puzzle must be completed in under ten minutes or else the game is over.<br><br>While trying to solve each puzzle, various enemies will be roaming around the play area. Running into them will cost the player some health. If the player loses all of their health, they will lose a life. If the player loses all three of their lives, the game will end.<br><br>While trying to solve a puzzle, the player can pause the game and view an unscrambled picture of the puzzle they are working on. After looking at the solution the first time, each additional time after the unscrambled picture will start to degrade in quality and be of less of a help for the player.<br><br>Once the puzzle is solved, the amount of remaining time plus the amount of health the player has left over is calculated into the player's score.",
