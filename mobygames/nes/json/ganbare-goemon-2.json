  "description": "Sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ganbare+Goemon%21+Karakuri+Douchuu\">Ganbare Goemon!</a>, Goemon 2 puts you back in the shoes of Goemon as he traverses feudal Japan looking to bring justice to any corrupt baddies he may find. <br><br>Joining Goemon in his adventure is the wacky ninja Ebisumaru which allows for simultaneous 2-player gameplay, marking the biggest difference in terms of gameplay with the original. The game keeps the straightforward side-scrolling beat 'em up formula and even removes some of the maze-like elements in the previous game, adding new weapons and upgrades to make the game more action-oriented. Wandering through the stages is still possible and you can enter several stores and locations and trigger amusing humorous sequences keeping in tone with the lighthearted spirit of the series.",
