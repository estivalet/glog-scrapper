  "description": "<i>Super Pinball</i> as the name suggests is a video game version of pinball. At the beginning of the game the player is given an incomplete mahjong hand with one missing tile. They are then shown the tile that will complete their hand and locating that tile is the goal of the pinball game. When the tile is found the game ends immediately. The players now completed hand will determine their final score as their score from pinball will be multiplied by the strength of their hand. <br><br>As in a typical pinball game, players shoot the pinball into play and then take control of a pair of flippers trying to keep the ball in play. The pinball table itself is car-themed, for example the table has the letters C-A-R and also has a gas stand slot machine. The table is made up of six screens with some parts accessible by getting the ball into a certain location. Some of the screens have their own goals to rack up points such as destroying UFO's with the pinball.<br><br>Players start with three pinballs and can earn more pinballs with high scoring play. The game can also  end when the player loses all of their pinballs.\n",
