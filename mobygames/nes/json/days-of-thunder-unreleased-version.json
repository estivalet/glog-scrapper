  "description": "<i>Days of Thunder: Unreleased Version</i> is a prototype for a tie-in racing video game developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,122221/\">Chris Oberth</a> at <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Mindscape+SA\">Mindscape</a> for the 1990 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Paramount+Pictures+Corporation\">Paramount Pictures</a> film of the same name starring <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,129204/\">Tom Cruise</a>.<br><br>Mindscape ultimately decided to cancel the in-house development of the game and outsourced it to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Krome+Studios+Melbourne\">Beam Software</a>, work that was eventually released as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Days+of+Thunder\">Days of Thunder</a>.<br><br>In 2020, the Video Game History Foundation recovered the source code from Oberth's developing materials and used it to make a small print run of <i>Days of Thunder</i> cartridges, compatible with Nintendo Entertainment System as a fundraiser for Oberth’s widow. Once the game was sold out, the source code was published on GitHub.",
