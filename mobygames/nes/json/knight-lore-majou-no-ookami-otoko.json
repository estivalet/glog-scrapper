  "description": "The Famicom Disk System version of <i>Knight Lore</i> features changes from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/knight-lore\">original version</a>.\nWhile the game features the same general gameplay flow of finding items and bringing them back to a central location, some changes to the gameplay were made.<br><br>The game is now broken up into nine different stages consisting of eleven rooms each. This change also increases the number of items to find from eight to eleven and now there are eighty days instead of forty to complete the game. The ability to move objects in order to reach items that was present in the original game has been removed with this version of the game featuring more straight forward platforming challenges instead.
