  "description": "The unlicensed <i>Blackjack</i> plays just like the ‘American Blackjack’ rules found in the casino compete with all the things you expect to find like split, double down (named as double, used with restrictions), surrender (named as ‘give up’, not used in most real casinos) and insurance (named as insure) as well as the push and charlie rules. Before starting the game, the player can select things like starting money, table limit, and the number of decks used as well as changing the color and design of the cards. Two-player mode is also available with both players taking turns with ether one or two controllers.",
