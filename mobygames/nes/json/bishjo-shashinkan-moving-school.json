  "description": "In <i>Bish?jo shashinkan (Pretty girls photo exhibition</i> or something like that), your task is to photograph pretty girls in various situations. You are given a choice of point-and-shoot, single lens reflex and a pro camera. In order to get a real photograph, you must evaluate the lighting situation and subject and choose the correct shutter speed, film speed, aperture and whether to use flash or not.<br><br>The choice of camera is also a choice of difficulty level. With a point-and-shoot, you need only get one variable right, whereas the pro camera requires you to set both aperture, shutter and film speed correctly.<br><br>You are only given a few chances per shoot to get the right exposure, or you will just see a miscoloured picture flash briefly. Judging the exposure correctly grants you a picture of the girl, often in a surprising state of undressing, whereafter you progress to even more erotic poses. Later stages raise the difficulty level, forcing you to use the SLR, and later the meter-less pro camera.<br><br>Together with <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bish%c5%8djo+shashinkan%3a+Studio+Cut\">Bish?jo shashinkan: Studio Cut</a></i>, <i>Moving School</i> was released for the MSX and X68000 as the double feature <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Double+Vision%3a+Bish%c5%8djo+shashinkan+Special\">Double Vision: Bish?jo shashinkan Special</a></i>.",
