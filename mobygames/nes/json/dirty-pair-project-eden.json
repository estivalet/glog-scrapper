  "description": "<i>Dirty Pair: Project Eden</i> is a platform action game based on the anime movie of the same name. The game can either be played alone, in which case the player takes control of blue haired Yuri, or in a two-player simultaneous mode in which the second player takes control of red-haired Kei. The game consists of four sections. Section one and three are straightforward auto-scrolling platform stages in which the player has to jump around and shoot incoming enemies. In section two and four the environment and gameplay change to a non-linear room-based maze-layout in which the player has to find disks in order to finish the section. Many rooms are locked and must be unlocked first by using bombs, key cards or other means.",
