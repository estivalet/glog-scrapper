  "description": "<i>Pyramid</i> is a real-time puzzle game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tetris\">Tetris</a>. Stones of various shapes and sizes fall from the top of the screen, and you need to move and rotate the stones so they fill complete lines at the bottom of the screen. Should the stones reach the top of the screen the game is over. If you get in trouble, there are a limited number of bombs that can be used to clear a small section of stones at the bottom hopefully giving you more room to work with. Unlike the square and rectangular shaped pieces found in <i>Tetris</i>, each of the shapes in <i>Pyramid</i> have one or more angles to them making complete lines more difficult to form.",
