  "description": "The third game in the Jake Hunter/Tantei Jing?ji Sabur? series, returning to the Famicom Disk System and using two Disk Cards released on two separate dates (the Virtual Console version is both together). Jake attends a Motorcycle race, invited by a friend of Yulia's. Sabin Olsen, one of the racers, crashes. However, someone else's body is recovered from the crash site. Meanwhile, Sabin Olsen is located at a hotel, fleeing from the murder scene of a man he was supposed to meet, apparently framed.<br><br>Again, time plays an important role in this case. You have to solve the entire mystery before time runs out, and each action takes time, so you have to watch what you do. If you don't solve the mystery before time runs out, it results in a bad ending. In the tradition of Japanese text adventures, graphics are presented, and you select a command, such as what do, to where to go, who to talk to, or what to say.",
