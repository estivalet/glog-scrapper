  "description": "<i>Tom &amp; Jerry</i> is a side-scrolling platform game in which the famous cartoon characters are the main characters. Tom has mouse-napped Jerry's nephew Tuffy, and has him in the attic. <br><br>Playing Jerry, you must move through various levels of the house to reach, and free Tuffy. Jumping and running to move around and avoid obstacles, Jerry is also armed with a pocket full of marbles which he can throw at enemies (such as spiders or toy soldiers). He can also use mouse holes to get teleported around the level. <br><br>He can also pick up power-ups which can give him more lives, and stronger throws, etc.",
