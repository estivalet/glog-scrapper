  "description": "This NES version of Baseball Stars is the very first game in SNK's popular series.  It is also the most comprehensive game in the series.  You can create, name, upgrade, and manage your own team, as well as customize the team's logo and colors.  You can also change the stats of each individual player by paying him or her more money (earned from winning games).<br><br>There are eight already-created gimmick teams that you can also play with, including the American Dreams, Lovely Ladies, and the Ghastly Monsters.  You can set up a custom league which will keep complete stats on all players in the league.  All games are played in the famous SNK Stadium.",
