  "description": "In <i>Dai Meiro: Meiky? no Tatsujin</i> the player must navigate a 3D maze and reach the goal. Along the way, the player needs to find all the special items to open the last door. With each step, the player's POW is depleted, which can be regenerated by collecting items along the way. There are secret rooms and items that can assist the player in reaching the goal. There are also three mini-games that can be found in the maze. A mini-map can be brought up, but this will cost POW.<br><br>The game has no combat to speak of or random encounters. There are three levels of difficulty, which completely changes the layout of the mazes.",
