  "description": "<i>Higemaru Makaijima</i> is a puzzle action game. You play a ship captain who is trying to take out all the Higemaru pirates that have captured your ship. The arena is on a deck of a pirate ship. On the deck there are a bunch of barrels, which form maze-like patterns, and pirates. Your goal is to clear the deck from all pirates.<br><br>The barrels can be picked up and moved (pushed) around. You can throw the barrels at the pirates which will knock them out or knock them off the ship if you hit the knocked out pirate once more. The captain is an evil pirate and you can only knock him out for a moment before he attacks you again.<br><br>Some barrels on the deck are special and are flashing. You have to move them and collect the objects hidden inside, most likely fish. But you have to hurry, there is a time limit to clear the deck!",
