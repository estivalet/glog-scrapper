  "description": "Chaos ensues in the year 2191 as something goes wrong with the master computer that controls the entire planet. Player's take control of Steve Treiber who must destroy the master computer.<br><br>Power Blazer is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player has to jump and fight their way through seven futuristic levels. To dispose of his many mechanical enemies, Steve Treiber is equipped with a powerful boomerang. The range of the boomerang is limited by an energy bar which is fully depleted and then slowly recharged after the boomerang is thrown. The boomerang's range can be improved with power-ups. A more powerful boomerang that can be thrown through enemies can also be picked up. Other items include smart bombs and energy containers. They can be selected when the game is paused and used at any time. The first six levels can be played in any order. Once they are cleared, the final level is revealed. At the end of every level, a boss-fight awaits the player. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/power-blade\">Power Blade</a>, the US release of the game, was substantially altered in many ways.",
