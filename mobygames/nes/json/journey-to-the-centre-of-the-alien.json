  "description": "<i>Journey to the Centre of the Alien</i> is a futuristic homebrew 2D platform game starring Special Agent PDT-6. She is deployed at an unknown location on a secret mission. The game consists of several levels where strange eggs need to be located and picked up, before returning to the relay station at the starting position. Levels consist of several single, fixed screen linked together using the flip-screen mechanic and there is a small amount of freedom to explore and complete the level in a non-linear way.<br><br>Special Agent PDT-6 wears a cybernetic suit that provides some abilities such as swimming, double jumping and using her bum to bounce off enemies without being hurt. Gameplay involves a lot of platform elements such as precise movement and timing to avoid enemy patterns. Enemies cannot be killed. Certain parts of the environment are also deadly, such as sharp stones and spikes in the floor. A single encounter with an enemy or a hazard immediately removes one of the five starting lives. Additional objects can be collected as well. The HUD can be used to track how many eggs need to be located. When dead, the agent respawns right away and when the game is over it is possible to restart the entire game or to continue the last level.<br><br>The game debuted in the 2019 compilation <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mojonian-tales\">Mojonian Tales</a>. The title references the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Journey+to+the+Center+of+the+Earth\">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a> and a spoof of that game was previously explored in the developer's 2010 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/viaje-al-centro-de-la-napia\">Viaje al centro de la napia</a>.",
