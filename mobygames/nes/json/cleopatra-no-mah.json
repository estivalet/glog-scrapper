  "description": "<i>Cleopatra no Mah?</i> (<i>Cleopatra's Magic Treasure</i>) casts you as Daisuke Kusano, the son of an archaeologist.  You had come to spend summer vacation with your father at a dig in Alexandria, but now he has been abducted by demons in fulfillment of an ancient curse! You must set out on a quest to ancient tombs and temples along the length of the Nile, battling thieves and demons in search of an ancient necklace–the Tear of Isis–with which you can dispel the evil spirits and free your father.<br><br>The game is an adventure/RPG hybrid, with simple turn-based battles occurring within the framework of a typical menu-based first-person adventure game.  Movement, examination, and interaction are all achieved via menu options (go, look, take, use, etc.); battles simply restrict the menu to three basic combat options (attack, use item, or flee).  The player character levels with experience, but this only determines maximum HP, while attack and defense are based on the best weapon and armor currently in inventory.",
