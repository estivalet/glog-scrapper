  "description": "<i>Doug's Big Game</i> is a game based on the animated television series of the same name. In this game, you play as Doug, going around town and talking to friends and family. Your main goal is to find Patti, Doug's crush, as she does not show up on time. Along the way, Doug meets many familiar faces, including his parents, his sister Judy, and his friends like Skeeter, Beebe, and Chalky. They will give you clues as to where Patti may be. Doug also has Quailman segments, where Doug imagines that he is a superhero by the name of Quailman, and must do certain things like defeat a boss or clear a path. Each time you do this, you get a password. Do this enough times to eventually find Patti and win the game.",
