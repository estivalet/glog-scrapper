  "description": "While the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/nba-jam-99\">N64 version</a> moved away from its arcade roots and became a full 5-on-5 basketball simulation, the Game Boy Color version of <i>NBA Jam 99</i> retains the classic 2-on-2 arcade gameplay of the series. Regarding gameplay and graphics, it is very similar to developer Torus' earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/nba-jam-tournament-edition\">NBA Jam Tournament Edition</a>, but with updated color graphics and animations, more modes and options, and updated teams and players.<br><br>Game modes include single games (Head-to-Head), a full season, playoffs and a practice mode. All 29 NBA teams of the 1998-99 season are included, with five star players per team (each with their unique skills) available for playing. Selectable options include tag mode (for controlling both players on a team), power-ups (temporarily increase skills), hot spots (bonus points for scoring from a hot spot), juice mode (for accelerated gameplay), CPU skill and strategy (offensive, defensive or balanced) and more.<br><br>Matches are seen from the side, and controls remain simple: three buttons (including Start) for turbo, passing and shooting, with the turbo button enhancing the other actions when pressed.",
