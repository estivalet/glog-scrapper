  "description": "<i>Cubix: Robots for Everyone - Race 'n Robots</i> is a racing game based on the television series of the same name. There are three tracks to choose from at the start; four additional tracks can be unlocked by finding keys throughout the races. There are many different robots to choose from, each with different stats. Each race is three laps long, and there are many items that can affect your race. Blue pickups let you boost while red pickups stop you in your tracks. After completing the three original tracks in first place, you fight a boss, Holossal. You do this by defeating him in a versus race. There are also shortcuts along the way.",
