  "description": "<i>Ronaldo V-Soccer</i> is a soccer game endorsed by Brazilian superstar Ronaldo.<br><br>It offers a selection of 74 national teams and 40 European club teams. The European release of the game has real player names, but the US release replaces them with fictional ones. The teams can be used in a variety of modes: friendlies, leagues and cups (of either 8, 16 or 32 teams and a choice of neutral stadiums or home/away factoring in) and a practice mode (for full games or penalties). Two special Ronaldo cups are also available: a three-on-one cup and a final four round.<br><br>Options include game lengths of two, five or ten minutes, a choice of arcade and simulation mode and the optional golden goal rule for overtime. Before a match, strategy, formations and positions can be set. A match itself is seen from a bird's-eye view, with the field scrolling left to right. Controls allow for shots and passes (with the length of the button press determining the power), tackles and headers.",
