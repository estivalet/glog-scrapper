  "description": "<i>Triple Play 2001</i> for Game Boy Color is the only entry in Electronic Arts' baseball series to make an appearance on a handheld platform. The game features the 30 teams of the 2000 MLB season with real player names and their home ballparks, as well as the two all-star teams.<br><br>The game includes two modes: in single games, players can select from any of the included teams and set the game in any stadium. Three difficulty levels are available, the game length can be set from one to nine innings, and team rosters are modifiable. During a game, players will control pitching (slow, fast and curve balls are possible), batting (allowing for grounders, fly balls and bunts), fielding (there is an optional field assist mode) and base running.<br><br>In Home Run Derby mode, players select a slugger from any of the teams, and try to hit as many home runs as possible before getting ten outs. Advancing into the next round requires getting more homers than the opponent.",
