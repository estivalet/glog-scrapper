  "description": "<i>All-Star Baseball 2000</i> is the second portable installment of Acclaim's baseball series, and the first on the Game Boy Color. It is based closely on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/all-star-baseball-99_\">previous year's game</a>, with the major changes being the addition of color graphics and the rosters and teams updated for the 1999 MLB season.<br><br>All the same playing modes of the predecessor return: exhibition, season (now with four different possible lengths), playoffs, all-star game, Home Run Derby and batting practice. All 30 teams of the 1999 season are available.<br><br>Gameplay remains largely unchanged from the previous year or even <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/frank-thomas-big-hurt-baseball_\">Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball</a>. Pitching and batting are seen from behind home base, while during running and fielding the view switches to an isometric perspective of the field. Pitches are made by first aiming via height and direction meters, then choosing the pitching style and finally the speed. Batting is done in the traditional way by pushing buttons for either a swing or a bunt, with variations done through the D-Pad.",
