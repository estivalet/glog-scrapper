  "description": "<i>NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC</i> is a 2D adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/nba-showtime-nba-on-nbc\">3D console game</a>. Like the original, it is a two-on-two arcade basketball game following the lineage of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=NBA+Jam+series\">NBA Jam series</a>.<br><br>It includes all 29 teams of the 1999-2000 NBA season, with over 100 featured players. Modes include exhibition games, a full season, playoffs and a practice mode. Options have been reduced compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/nba-jam-99_\">NBA Jam 99</a>: length of quarters and overtime as well as AI difficulty can be set, and music and sound effects be turned on or off. <br><br>Gameplay is seen from the side and follows the NBA Jam gameplay of old, with two buttons for passing and shooting (on defense, stealing and blocking) and a turbo button for faster running and enhanced actions, including spectacular over-the-top dunks. Season progress is saved via passwords, and the game includes several unlockable bonuses, including additional courts with a street or a jungle theme.",
