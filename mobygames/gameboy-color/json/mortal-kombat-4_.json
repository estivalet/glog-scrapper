  "description": "Once upon a time, the thunder god Raiden fought against another god called Shinnok who wanted to conquer the universe. Raiden won and banished Shinnok, but now he is back and continues his previous quest. Raiden calls together other warriors to a tournament which determines the one to challenge Shinnok.<br><br><i>Mortal Kombat 4</i> is a traditional one-against-one versus fighting game. Both fighters try to emtpy the opponent's health bar with punches or kicks. Every fighter also has some special attacks which are triggered with certain button combinations. If the time limit of a round runs out, the fighter with more health wins.  <br><br>The mobile version of this game has a few differences in comparison to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/mortal-kombat-4\">console/PC brother</a>. It only has nine fighters (Raiden, Liu Kang, Scorpion, Reiko, Tanya, Fujin, Sub-Zero, Quan Chi and the unlockable Reptile) and less special moves. Because of the technical limitations of the platform, the game uses the engine of its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/mortal-kombat-3\">predecessor</a> and omits the new 3D look of the other versions.",
