  "description": "<i>Disney's The Emperor's New Groove</i> for the Game Boy Color is a 2D platform game based on the Disney movie of the same name. Like in the movie a selfish and cruel emperor is cursed and turned into a llama. You play as this former emperor and cynical llama in his search for a cure for his curse.<br><br>Each level is a series of platforms and the llama can walk around, duck and jump to navigate. He can charge and perform head butts to attack opponents. He can also spit as a ranged attack but requires spit drops for that which he must collect. The player has a number of hit-points but can collect hearts to replenish them.<br><br>Puzzles include locked doors, switches and barriers, which mostly have to be solved using your spit or charge action in the right places.",
