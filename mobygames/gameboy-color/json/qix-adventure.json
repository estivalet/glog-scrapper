  "description": "<i>Qix Adventure</i> is a handheld entry in Taito's arcade game series. The main mode of the game is the treasure mode which is more story oriented than previous games in the series. The player controls a character called Speedy whose task is to collect treasure from various beasts.<br><br>The gameplay works like previous games but with some differences. Like before a level is completed by capturing 75% of its area and two different enemies (sparx and qix) prevent the player from doing so. What's new is that the playfield also contains one beast and a chest which contains a treasure. The player can collect treasure by first capturing the beast which causes the chest to open and then capturing the object that is revealed. In this way it's possible to capture up to three pieces of treasure per level. There are also various items to collect that gives certain advantages when used.<br><br>In addition to the treasure mode there is also a battle mode and a version of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/qix\">Qix</a> game.
