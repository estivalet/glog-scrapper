  "description": "<i>Blue's Clues: Blue's Alphabet Book</i> is an educational game for pre-schoolers based on the TV show with the same name. The game focuses on teaching young players spelling, letters and the alphabet through several games with simple controls and few button inputs.<br><br>From the game's main menu the player can either play with Blue's alphabet book (which constitutes the full game), or play any of the games by selecting any of the friends hanging out in the same room.<br><br>In the full game, pages have gone missing in Blue's book, so Steve and Blue set out to play various games with their friends to find clues. After a certain amount of games have been played, pages are filled in with pictures for the letters. The pages can be played in any order.<br><br>",
