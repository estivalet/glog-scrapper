  "description": "The Game Boy Color version of <i>Toy Story 2</i> is a 2D platformer starring Buzz Lightyear. <br><br>The plot follows the movie of the same name, and so Buzz needs to rescue Woody, who was stolen from the bedroom by a toy collector. The player will run and jump through several movie-inspired locations including Andy's house, the city streets, the toy store and the airport. Buzz can shoot lasers and that will help him to defeat toys that oppose him in the levels. Surprisingly, Buzz' friends from the movie (like Rex or the three-eyed green aliens) will try to stop him too and need to be dealt with in this game.<br><br>There are several special powers (like a flying ability or a running-on-air move) available to Buzz at certain points of the levels, usually associated with collecting hard-to-reach coins or weapon power-ups.
