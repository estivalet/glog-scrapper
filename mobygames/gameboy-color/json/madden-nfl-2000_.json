  "description": "The first entry in the long-running Madden football series on the Game Boy Color is also the first entry in the series on a handheld in three years. The versions on consoles and computers having migrated to 3D graphics, the GBC edition uses traditional sprite-based 2D with a top-down view of the playing field.<br><br>Game modes include Exhibition matches, Sudden Death games (first team to score wins), Full Seasons and Playoffs. Progress can be saved through use of passwords. Game features include many known from other iterations of the series, such as player injuries and substitutions, audibles, detailed statistics, control of weather and game time, and more. The playbook not only includes a wide number of standard plays, but also a variety of trick plays like fake field goals and reverse plays.<br><br>Team and player names and statistics are from the 1999 NFL season.",
