  "description": "As Tanner, you're going undercover to be the wheelman for a crime syndicate in order to break open a big case. On the way, you'll eliminate competition, drive getaway cars, scare some people silly, evade plenty of police and steal one of their cars, dodge bad guys and smash through a few windows.<br><br>You have multiple vehicles that you will use and there are also mini games like checkpoint, pursuit, survival and get away. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/driver\">other versions</a>, the GBC version is top down and the city of San Francisco is missing.",
