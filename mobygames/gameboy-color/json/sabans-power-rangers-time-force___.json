  "description": "<i>Power Rangers: Time Force</i> for the Game Boy Color is a platformer based on the 2001 version of the long-running franchise. In this incarnation, the Power Rangers are time police from the year 3000. Various criminals have escaped to different time zones and the rangers must apprehend them.<br><br>The game takes place over eight levels. For some levels, the order in which to take them on is up to the player. Locations include cities in present day, past and future, a prehistoric jungle, a futuristic underwater base and more. At the start of each level, the player can select from one of five rangers (Red, Yellow, Pink, Green and Blue), all of which differ slightly in the stats vitality, skill, power and speed. The goal in each level is to find and defeat the escaped criminal within a time limit. On the way there are monsters to be fought and traps to be avoided. For defeating enemies or removing obstacles, the rangers can choose between their fists, a fighting staff or a gun. The staff and gun drain energy which slowly refills on its own but can also be refilled quickly by collecting the appropriate powerup. Other powerups include a health refill, a clock that takes time off the time limit, and the ranger warp system, which allows the player to change their ranger mid-level.<br><br>Starting in level three, simply defeating the boss is not enough: once he is down, the Power Rangers must use their Megazord mech (in either Red or Blue forms) to beat him again. These battles are similar to a traditional one-on-one fighting game.",
