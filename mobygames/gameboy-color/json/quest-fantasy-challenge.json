  "description": "<i>Quest: Fantasy Challenge</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mr-do\">Mr. Do!</a> variant. Brian, the hero from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/quest-64\">Quest 64</a>, has to beat the levels by collecting all crystals. However, the whole screen is filled with dirt which is removed by simply walking into it; clearing a walking path for the monsters with the deadly touch. Brian's main weapon is his magic staff which shoots a powerful blast, but needs to recharge for a while before it can be used again. An alternative weapon are the chests which stand around the levels and are subject to gravity: digging the dirt under it causes it to fall down. A chest to the head is unhealthy for both Brian and his enemies. There are also power-ups to collect, e.g. higher speed or more firepower.",
