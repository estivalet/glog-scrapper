  "description": "Tuffy has gotten lost and is calling for help! Jerry notices that and decides to go save him. But it looks like Tom has heard Tuffy's calling as well, and is searching for him. Playing as Jerry, players have to find Tuffy before Tom does. The gameplay is simple: move Jerry to the goal of each level to proceed, avoid enemies and obstacles (since Jerry doesn't have the ability to kill enemies) and collect cheeses and medals for points. After finishing a level, players can play through a mini game for bonuses. The game's graphics are in 2D. Players can choose to play in one player mode or two players mode. Players can also turn the music on or off. In order to enter a chosen level, players must remember the given passwords.",
