  "description": "Lady Deathstrike discovers plans which allow her to build a weapon that will melt the adamantium skeleton that protects Logan (also known as Wolverine), a member of the noble mutant organization of X-Men. When this so-called destabilizer ray is completed, Lady Deathstrike and her fellow mutants Cyber and Sabretooth fully intend to use it, depriving the X-Men of their most powerful fighter. Wolverine has no choice but do whatever it takes to stop her from achieving this goal.<br><br>Wolverine goes alone in this action platform title, where the player takes control of the most famous of the X-Men, who hacks and slashes his way through twenty levels of enemies and bosses. There are four main activities which Wolvie can perform: hack and slash with his claws (the main attack); jump (very important to get through levels); heal (if he stays still, he will heal a little at a time; however, each level has a limited amount of time to complete, so standing around too much can be lethal); and enter the rage mode. If the player presses the attack button several times in a row, Wolvie will go off in a rage. Although hard to control in this state, his attack range improves. He also loses a little health every time.",
