  "description": "After years of watching the Whos of  Who-Ville celebrate Christmas, the Grinch has had enough. The Grinch devises a plan to put a stop to this noisy celebration by stealing the villages Christmas presents.<br><br><i>The Grinch</i> is a <i>Pac-Man variant</i>. The game consists of seven scenes divided into several levels. Each level is viewed from a top-down perspective. The levels typically consist of a few screens of the village and also may contain houses which can be entered. In order to complete each level, the Grinch (or his dog Max in some scenes) must collect all the presents scattered around in a set amount of time. The time limit can be extended by finding timer icons. The levels are populated by the Who-Ville citizens who will chase the Grinch if he is spotted, so it's best that the Grinch try to remain as stealthy as possible while snatching presents.<br><br>The Grinch only has a limited number of attacks he can perform to stun the villagers who chase him, thus leaving running away as his most used option when spotted by a villager, since a villager can only chase the Grinch for a short amount of time before tiring themselves out. In some levels, the Grinch will be driving a small car while doing his foul deeds. In the Max levels, Max has a jump that he can perform to jump over the dogs who spot him.\n",
