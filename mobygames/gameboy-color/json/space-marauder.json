  "description": "The Burai, a race of evil super-brain aliens, have launched their plan to conquer the universe with their army of half-organic, half-robot creatures - the robo-mutants. It's up to the player to stop them! Strap on your jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter.<br><br><i>Space Marauder</i> is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.<br><br><i>Space Marauder</i> is the Game Boy Color version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/burai-fighter\">Burai Fighter</a>. Game play is exactly the same. Like <i>Burai Fighter</i> it offers the same three difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts. It doesn't include the Vs. mode.",
