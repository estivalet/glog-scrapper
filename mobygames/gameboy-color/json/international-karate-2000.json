  "description": "<i>International Karate 2000</i> is a remake of the classic beat 'em up <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=International+Karate\">International Karate</a> in which you play as a new entry in the International Karate championship and travel the world in hopes of defeating each local champion in tournament-legal (for points) matches.<br><br>The game is played from a non-scrolling side view, with your attacks being determined by combinations of the attack buttons and the directional arrows. As mentioned you win matches via points awarded whenever you connect a direct hit or perform a successful move. <br><br>This version of the game adds a health bar that influences performance and a round-based system. Furthermore all graphics have been redrawn and the character selection has been expanded and now includes 12 playable characters, each from a different location.",
