  "description": "Players take on the role of a spy in white (or black), and go on a mission to go to four different locations and collect 4 items: a CD, passport, key and a sum of cash (and a brief-case to contain these things). But there's a snatch, another spy is also on the same mission. Players have to sweep him out of their way and collect the items before he does!<br><br>Players have a choice among four locations and between Black Spy and White Spy. Each location contains a certain number of levels, which all have the same objectives: get the briefcase, collect the four items and get to the exit door. Players can try to slow their competitor down by killing him by placing traps in the rooms (dynamite, coil, spring, bucket and a time bomb) or using weapons (fists, knife and stick) when encountering him. When getting killed, players will be redirected to the starting point and all collected items are lost. Players are provided with a map which shows how many rooms there are and what is inside each room (trap, players' counterpart, items). Players can never be killed off entirely. The game is only over when the counterpart gets all the items and escapes through the exit door.<br><br>The graphics are in 2D. The player's process is saved via passwords. The player can play against the computer or another player.",
