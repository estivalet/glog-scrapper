  "description": "The cartoony golf game <i>CyberTiger</i> makes its way from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/cybertiger\">consoles</a> to the Game Boy Color, adapted for the handheld with 2D graphics and a smaller selection of courses and options.<br><br>Gameplay modes include Career, Strokes and Rapid Fire. Rapid Fire has two golfers swinging at the same time trying to reach the hole first, and is the only mode also available for two players via link cable. <br><br>The game contains three extravagant 18-hole courses: Grand Canyon, Hawaii and Mt. Lava. During gameplay, a hole is seen from a top-down perspective. Before the shot is made, the club and the direction are selected. Making a swing follows the standard three-click method (start, power, accuracy). The shot is shown in an animated sequence seen from behind the golfer.<br><br>A special twist comes into play with power-ups. These lie on the fairway and are picked up when the ball flies over them. They can be used for extra powerful shots, for making the opponent lose a stroke, for blowing their ball away with a whirlwind, and more.",
