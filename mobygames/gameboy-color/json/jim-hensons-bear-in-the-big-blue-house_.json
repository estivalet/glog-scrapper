  "description": "<i>Jim Henson's Bear in the Big Blue House</i> is a game based on the TV series of the same name. Today is Ojo's birthday, and there are many things to do. There are two modes: Adventure and Activity.<br><br>In Adventure Mode. you travel around the house to find characters to play with. Each character has their own mini-game, and some characters have multiple. Treelo has three mini-games; in the first one you must go through a maze to find a beehive, the second one has you blow bubbles into his mouth, and the final mini-game has you catch feathers. With Tutter, you must catch popcorn while avoiding the burnt popcorn. Pip and Pop also have two mini-games; in the first one you must play a matching game, and in the second, you are a goalie for a game called Pondball. Bear also has two-mini games. In the first one, you must sneak around and unwrap the present while he's not looking. In the second one, you must bounce the stars along so they don't fall. This mode has two difficulties, Easy and Hard. Each time you complete a few levels of a mini-game, you get a puzzle piece. Get all of the puzzle pieces to win.<br><br>Activity Mode is just the mini-game without the house and the puzzle. You do not get puzzle pieces in this mode. You can also choose easy or hard.",
