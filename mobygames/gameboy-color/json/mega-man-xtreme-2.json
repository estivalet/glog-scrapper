  "description": "A new threat is arising! Reploids are suddenly breaking down, and when their bodies are investigated, no traces of their &quot;souls&quot; can be found in their memory! No one knows how it is happening, and the Reploid world is in a panic. To make matters worse, several Mavericks from the past are rampaging again, only this time with a new, deadly &quot;DNA Soul&quot; chip installed in them, making them even deadlier than before! The only hope left is in the Maverick Hunters, and their greatest heroes, X and Zero, to get to the bottom of this incident.<br><br>It's up to you to guide X and Zero through this deadly new mission and find out who is behind this Soul Eraser terror!",
