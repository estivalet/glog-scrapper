  "description": "<i>Spirou: The Robot Invasion</i> is a 2D side'scrolling platform game based on the Franco-Belgian comic <i>Spirou et Fantasio</i>.<br><br>Fantasio bought a strange mechanical device. When he brings it home and thoroughly inspects it, it turns out to be a malevolent robot who subsequently escapes from the house. Soon a villain called Cyanide appears to be involved and the entire town is crawling with evil robots. It's up to the player (as Spirou) to set things straight! Armed with a maul you have to trash the robots. Controls are similar to other platform games: you can walk, jump, attack, use a switch and grab a ledge. You'll have to solve simples puzzles such as pressing switches to open doors. You can pick up items that restore your health or unlock bonus levels. The game also has a UBI key that allows you to unlock a secret level, and can also be used to unlock secrets in other Ubi Soft games.<br><br>The game is presented in comic strip style much like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/comix-zone\">Comix Zone</a>, where you move from frame to frame, each divided by a white border.",
