  "description": "This side-scrolling game allows the player to control  different Looney Tunes characters and their different abilities to advance through the levels, seven in all.  The player can use Daffy Duck (throwing a frisbee to defeat enemies with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Mario+licensees\">Mario</a>-style gameplay), Tweety Bird (elude Sylvester throughout the level), Porky Pig (control a bi-plane to shoot down enemies), Taz (really only a bonus game in which he has to collect as many steaks as possible in 60 seconds), Speedy Gonzalez (elude ghosts and ghouls in a haunted mansion), Roadrunner (of course running from his arch enemy, Wile E. Coyote) and finally Bugs Bunny (gameplay similar to Daffy).",
