  "description": "<i>Love Hina Party</i> is one of several games based on a Love Hina manga, which in turn was made into anime. The basic story in Love Hina centers around a young boy, Keitaro Urashima, trying to fulfill his promise to a girl he shortly met as a child but whose name he has forgotten. Their promise was to study hard and get accepted at Tokyo University, where they could meet once again. While studying for exam, Keitaro is staying at his grandmother's hotel which seem to be inhabited by girls only. As a new manager of the hotel, he is having a plethora of ups and downs in his relationship with the girls, and one of them even turns out to be the very girl he made a promise to.<br><br>This game puts you in shoes of Keitaro himself as he resumes his duties of a hotel manager. During adventure mode, you can check certain predefined locations and speak with characters you meet, sometimes selecting your answer during conversation. Sometimes during the story, the girls in Hinata apartments will ask you quiz questions about the Love Hina anime. The action mode in the game is done via four different mini-games which, unlike the adventure mode, use 3rd-person perspective.",
