  "description": "<i> Cyborg Kuro-chan 2: White Woods no Gyakush? </i> is a 2D rail shooter based on the <i>Cyborg Kuro-chan</i> manga and anime series. Players take control of the titular cat Kuro, a formerly normal housecat who survives being turned into a cyborg and sets out to take revenge on the mad scientist who did it to him with the help of his new cyborg weaponry. This entry plays exactly the same as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cyborg-kuro-chan-devil-fukkatsu\">previous game</a>. The 2D sidescrolling levels scroll automatically. Instead of controlling Kuro, players use the d-pad to control a crosshair to aim and shoot. With his array of cyborg weaponry, players can shoot down enemies and blow up the scenery. In addition, players can use the B button to make Kuro jump in order to dodge obstacles. At the beginning of every level, players can customize Kuro's weapon loadout; as the game progresses, players gain access to new guns they can equip. During levels, players can use the select button to toggle between all equipped weapons.",
