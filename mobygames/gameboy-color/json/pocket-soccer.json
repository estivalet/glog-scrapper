  "description": "<i>Pocket Soccer</i> is a, fast-paced simplified soccer/football game played with teams of five players and two substitutes. One action button is used for shooting, the other for passing the ball or tackling opponents. <br><br>The following game modes are available: quick start (randomly picks two teams and a venue), exhibition (lets you chose your team, the opponent team and the venue), playoffs (lets you choose between 8, 16 and 32 teams) and league (where you need to get your team to the top and can trade players as you go). There are 12 fictive venues to choose from (gymnasium, street, beach, schoolyard...).<br><br>Each player has their own statistics (stamina, skill, tackling, agility, accuracy, power, teamplay, speed and even IQ) that impact the team as a whole. Besides this, a lot of parameters can be customized, be it for teams for which you can change the name, color, composition and line up, or players for whom you can change the name, gender and facial features.<br><br>Also available is a 2-player mode that requires two Game Boy Colors connected by a Game Link cable.
