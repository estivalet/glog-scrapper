  "description": "<i>Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest</i> is the second entry in Nintendo's baseball series to appear on a handheld. Compared to the contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/ken-griffey-jrs-slugfest\">N64 version</a>, the Game Boy Color version has a few less features, simpler controls and presents everything in traditional 2D graphics.<br><br>Game modes include exhibition games, a full season (three different lengths), World Series and Home Run Derby. The game includes teams and player names of the 1998 season (but not the licensed stadiums of the N64 version), with the All-Star teams also included. During a season, players can be traded, and stats and standings are saved to battery-backed RAM.<br><br>Gameplay follows a standard model of a view behind the pitcher for pitching and batting, and an overhead view of the field for running and fielding. Compared to other baseball games, the field view is rather close, and arrows help in locating the controlled players when they are out of view. Controls are based on the A and B buttons to select the action and the D-Pad for influencing direction during pitching and batting.",
