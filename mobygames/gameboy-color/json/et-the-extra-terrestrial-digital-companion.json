  "description": "<i>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial: Digital Companion</i> is a game based on the classic 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. First, E.T. asks you many questions, like your first and last name, zip code, address, and favorite things. Then, a planner is set up that you can use daily. It includes a clock, a calendar, a clock, and a &quot;To-Do List&quot; where you can list tasks that need to be done. You can also print anything that needs to be remembered on the Game Boy Printer.<br><br>The main &quot;game&quot;of this digital companion are the five included mini-games. In &quot;Bicycle Race,&quot; you race the clock as Elliot, while jumping on ramps and avoiding obstacles. &quot;Trivia&quot; is a simple trivia game asking you questions about the E.T. movie or simply space in general. &quot;Tile Puzzle&quot;is a simple tile puzzle with three difficulties, each with more pieces. &quot;Pair Up&quot; is simply a matching game that counts how many moves you do. &quot;World Scramble&quot; is just a world scrambling game, with two hints for each word. You can also take care of your own Flopglopple by playing, feeding, and talking with it. Earning points in mini-games gives you pictures to unlock.\n",
