  "description": "<i>3-D Ultra Pinball: Thrillride</i> is a two-dimensional pinball game made to look like Hersheypark. This version of the game is an adaptation of the Windows version of the same name.<br><br>Two sets of flippers are controlled as well as bumper cars in the pits to extend the life of each ball. Up to four players can hand off the Game Boy Color and play in turn. Each player is represented by a different anthropomorphic Hershy's product. There are three different difficulty levels which each player can set individually so novice players can stand a chance against the veterans of the game.<br><br>High scores are saved to the battery backup.",
