  "description": "<i>Karakuri Jiin Satsujinjiken</i> (??????????) is the first Detective Conan mystery adventure game released for Game Boy Color. During the holidays, Conan and Ran decide to meet at a certain cafe. While there, Ran runs into her classmate Miki by chance, who is part-time working at that very cafe. In turn, Miki calls them to come to her place where she tells them about her worrying about her sister Satomi. Apparently she said she's going on a trip as she was heading out, but she never called or told Miki where she went. She is a rather methodical person, which makes her behavior suspiciously strange, and Miki asks Ran and Conan to help her find her sister. Also, before she went out, she was acting strange according to Miki. After listening in more detail and agreeing to help Miki look for Satomi, Conan and Ran head to Satomi's room to look for clues about her whereabouts. There they find out what was a direction to a secluded old temple and with that as their only lead to go on, they set out to find Satomi.<br><br>Exploring locations is done in top-down perspective which also allows you to switch between characters, thus not controlling Conan alone. The map system shows you your current location. Message system is used for dialogues with other characters which uses typical first person view displaying the talking character and the text below the character image. On your investigation while searching for clues and talking to other characters, you will obtain keywords which lets you think the case through and after collecting the necessary keywords, you can start the reasoning process. Conan also keeps track on characters he meets, and you can access character profiles from the in-game menu, the same way you access keywords or map system.",
