  "description": "<i>Simba's Mighty Adventure</i> is based on the Disney film <i>The Lion King</i> and its direct-to-video sequel <i>Simba's Pride</i>. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/disneys-the-lion-king-simbas-mighty-adventure\">PlayStation version</a>, the Game Boy Color version presents the story as a traditional side-scrolling platformer, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/disneys-the-lion-king\">earlier</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/lion-king\">adaptations</a> of the original film.<br><br>The game consists of 10 levels, with the first six based on <i>The Lion King</i> and the last four based on <i>Simba's Pride</i>. In the first four, players control Simba as a cub, and from then on as an adult. To get through the levels, Simba can run, jump and climb up on ledges. To defeat the various enemies (snakes, spiders, monkeys, frogs, scorpions and many other critters) Simba can jump on top of them, strike them with his claw or (as an adult only) roar at them to make them flee. Some of the levels end in boss fights. The fourth level, based on the stampede scene from the first film, is seen from a top-down perspective and the screen scrolls automatically. Level progress is saved via passwords.<br><br>In all levels, Simba can pick up various collectibles. There are stars (collecting 100 gains an extra life), beetles (to refill or extend the health bar), a lion head (extra life), and parts of Simba's amulet. Collecting all five parts of the amulet gains an extra life and opens up a mini-game to be played before the next level. The games include Bug Drop (collecting bugs dropped from the top of the screen), Bug Tennis, Catch the Worms (picking up worms from holes and depositing them in a container) and Beetle Hunt (finding Pumbaa within a time limit, with yellow bugs increasing the score and red bugs decreasing the time limit). The mini games can also be played from the main menu.<br><br>A mini-game exclusive for two players via link cable is called Tag: playing as Simba and Nala, the players try to hold on to a star for two minutes total. The star changes hands when the other player touches the star-carrier.",
