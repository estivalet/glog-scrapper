  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/star-wars-episode-i-racer\">The game</a> based on the pod racing scenes from <i>Star Wars: Episode I</i> received a unique adaptation on the Game Boy Color.<br><br>The game features 5 different planets with 4 tracks each for a total of 20 tracks. Only the first track from each planet is available from the start and the only available pod racer available to select is Anakin Skywalker's. Winning races unlocks further tracks on each planet and allows the player to choose the racers of the beaten opponents. When all four courses from a planet are won, a duel against Sebulba opens up. Winning it unlocks Sebulba's racer, but losing another race takes it away again. All racers differ in top speed, acceleration, turning rate and body strength (i.e. amount of damage the racer can take).<br><br>Races are seen from a top-down view and are always one-on-one. Unlike in the film or the console game, there are no laps and the first racer to cross the finish line wins. When normal top speed is reached, a flashing light indicates that a turbo boost is available that allows the racer to reach its real top speed. The turbo shouldn't be used for more than a few seconds, though, because overusing it damages the racer. Crashing into the opponent or track obstacles also causes damage. Too much damage causes the racer to blow up, but the only real effect is some time loss, since it is put back on the track after a few seconds. It is possible to repair damage mid-race at the cost of speed and acceleration.<br><br>The game offers a two-player mode via link cable and the cartridge has a rumble feature.",
