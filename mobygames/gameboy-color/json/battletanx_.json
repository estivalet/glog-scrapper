  "description": "<i>BattleTanx</i> for Game Boy Color is an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/battletanx\">N64 game of the same name</a>. It puts its own spin on the original game's story, features adapted music tunes from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/battletanx-global-assault\">the sequel</a>, and turns the free-roaming 3D action into a top-down 2D game.<br><br>In a world where a virus has wiped out 99% of women, governments have fallen and power is in the hand of brutal tank gangs. Protagonist Griffin searches the former United States for his love Madison, a journey that will take him from Los Angeles to San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York and Washington D.C., fighting the most notorious gangs in each city.<br><br>The game's main story mode consists of fifteen missions, three per city, all seen from a top-down perspective. The objectives vary between destroying all enemy tanks, collecting items or reaching a certain point on the map. Throughout the course of the game, players will control three different tanks, all with slightly different weapons and capabilities. Destroying enemy tanks leaves symbols that when picked up, restore health. Weapon power-ups to be found on the streets are homing missiles, reflective shots, and even a nuke. Limited invisibility and extra lives are also available.<br><br>In story mode, progress is saved via passwords. The game's levels can be played independently from the story in battle mode. ",
