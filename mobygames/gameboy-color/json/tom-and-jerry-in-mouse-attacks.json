  "description": "Tom has captured Jerry's five friends: Duckling, Uncle Peco, Tyke, Tuffy and Muscles and has locked them up in five different locations, and it's up to the player (as Jerry) to rescue them. The game features a total of five levels, and all have the same objective: find a way to get to Jerry's friends. The player moves Jerry around, avoiding enemies and obstacles while collecting musical notes. In each level, Jerry meets two characters: Angel Jerry and Devil Jerry, who give Jerry hints and tips. There are doors leading to mini games, and players have to collect a certain number of musical notes (which is shown above each door) to gain access. These mini games are designed with young players' skill in mind. After completing a mini game, players acquire items which can be used to solve puzzles later on. Mini games may repeat with increasing difficulty as players proceed in the game. Once one of Jerry's friends is found, Jerry will need to defeat a &quot;boss&quot; to proceed to the next level.<br><br>The game's graphics are in 2D. Players have a choice among English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Danish. The game knows no save function. In order to choose a level, players have to enter the right passwords.",
