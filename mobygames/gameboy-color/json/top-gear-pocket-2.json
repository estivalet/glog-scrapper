  "description": "Another round of Top Gear rally action on the GBC. On this occasion, depending on where you finish each race, you are awarded points. These points then go towards improving the stats of the rally car you are using (speed, braking, acceleration and top speed).<br><br>Championships are split into seasons, each harder then the last. You can opt to change the weather conditions (day, night, sunny, rain, snow) or practise on the track to get used to the corners and timing.<br><br>You can also play against a friend in two-player mode.",
