  "description": "<i>Dragon Tales: Dragon Wings</i> is a game based on the animated series Dragon Tales. At the start, you get to choose between two dragons; Org and Cassie, and also pick your difficulty. Your main goal, as a dragon, is to take lessons for flight, each with a specific goal. Each lesson has a set amount of missions to complete. Some are as simple as flying to a specific spot, while others are more elaborate and have multiple steps. Berries can also be collected to make new records. These missions are also timed, giving the player more of an incentive to play the lessons again to achieve the high score. Other missions have you pick up objects and move them to a certain place. There are 15 lessons in total, and some need to be unlocked by completing other lessons. A sliver trophy is given for a completion, and a golden trophy is given for a 100% completion.",
