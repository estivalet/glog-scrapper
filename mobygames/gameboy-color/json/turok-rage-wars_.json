Users are cautioned that incorrect information may appear in the description which does not apply to this platform and needs to be revised]<br><br>If you enjoyed the multiplayer modes in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Turok+2%3a+Seeds+of+Evil\">Turok 2</a>, then this is for you.<br><br>Instead of the usual Turok single player missions, you must control your character and complete certain missions (from getting the most frags in a time limit, finding an item, or lasting the distance). Before a match you also get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of more weapons and character skins as you complete the objectives.<br><br>Multiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from (frag and tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like the single player missions) time trials and frag fests.",
