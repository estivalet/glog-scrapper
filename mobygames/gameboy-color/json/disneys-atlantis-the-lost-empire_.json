  "description": "<i>The Lost Empire</i> is a side-view action game with platforming elements. Embark on an epic journey to find the fabled lost city, rescue Princess Kida and save Atlantis from certain doom. The game comprises ten levels.<br><br>The crew consists of five members which have special skills, e.g. demolitions or fixing machines, and skill levels for the game's physical activities like jumping, using weapons or holding breath. While each level starts with Milo Thatch, the main character of the movie, at certain points of a level (represented with a radio), players can switch the active character. Many obstacles can only be overcome by certain characters which means the switching mechanic has to be used frequently.",
