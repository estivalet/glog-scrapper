  "description": "<i>SWIV</i> on the Game Boy Color is an adaptation of the 1992 SNES version Super SWIV (aka Firepower 2000 in North America). It's a vertical scrolling shooter where the player may choose to pilot a chopper or to drive an attack Jeep. The chopper is not blocked by obstacle, but can only fire straight forward. Unlike the SNES/Genesis version, Jeep and Chopper have same specs: same speed, same armor, same agility. Levels are also 'inspired' by the 1992 version but modified (less long, less enemies). The 2 players mode (one controlling the chopper, the other in the jeep) was also removed.\n",
