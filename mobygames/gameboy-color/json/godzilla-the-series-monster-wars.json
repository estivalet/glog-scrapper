  "description": "<i>Godzilla: The Series - Monster Wars</i> is the second game based on the animated TV series <i>Godzilla: The Series</i>. Godzilla is the good guy and has to save the world from other monsters, but unfortunately the military wants him dead. So he walks through the ten side-scrolling levels with different background graphics and kills all opposition. Godzilla has six attacks, e.g. a fire breath or a tail whip, which the player has to trigger. Because of his size, there are no variations in movement. Being hit causes Godzilla's life energy to go down.<br><br>This is mostly the same game as the predecessor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/godzilla-the-series\">Godzilla: The Series</a>. The only differences are that Godzilla now has to be moved manually to the right, the head attack has a crosshair and the life energy does not automatically refill anymore.",
