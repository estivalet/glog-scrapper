  "description": "<i>Toy Story Racer</i> is a kart racing game based on the Toy Story films. Completely different from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/disneypixar-toy-story-racer\">the PlayStation game of the same name</a>, the GBC version features circuit racing on ten tracks and employs 3D graphics through use of pre-rendered full motion video.<br><br>The game includes two modes: a tournament and a quick race. Only three tracks are available from the start in quick race mode, the others have to be unlocked in the tournament. Players can select from four Toy Story characters: Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Bo Peep and Mr. Potato Head. The tracks are located in Andy's house, the Pizza Planet and the streets around the neighborhood.<br><br>Races are against three competitors and are seen from a third-person view behind the player's kart. The tracks have been pre-rendered in (simple) 3D; hitting the gas begins playing the track video to give the illusion of the kart moving forward on the track. Turns are thus automatic, but steering is still necessary to not crash into the sides of the track and slow down. Various items can be found on the road, some with positive, some with negative effects. Positive ones include a horseshoe for invincibility and a tire for perfect grip. Negative ones are an anchor for a full stop, a snail for reduced speed and a steering wheel that switches left and right on the controls. There are also golden coins to pick up. These become necessary if a character is removed from the game by finishing in fourth place or not completing a lap within the time limit. With enough coins, removed characters can be bought back. If all four are removed, it's game over.<br><br>Progress through the tournament is stored via passwords. The game has a high score table (deleted upon turning off), selectable difficulty and the choice of races consisting of 3 or 5 laps.",
