  "description": "<i>WCW Mayhem</i> is a wrestling game with the official WCW license and twelve-real-life wrestlers to play with. During the matches, the opponents try to perform moves while both wrestlers are close together (basically by holding a direction and pressing buttons with the correct timing) to diminish the opponent's energy. This is necessary so his shoulders can be held to the mat for three seconds, which ends the match. One speciality of this game is the possibility to leave the ring and fight in the locker room or on the street. Besides the career mode (trying to win the WCW title by passing through lower leagues with lower difficulty) and single matches against the AI, there is also the option to play against another human participant.",
