  "description": "<i>Carl Lewis Athletics 2000</i> is a sports game focusing on Decathlon and its ten disciplines: pole vault, long jump, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, high jump and running (100, 110 hurdles, 400 and 1500 metres). The controls follow the traditional mechanics: rhythmic button mashing, followed if necessary by pressing an action button. Besides the traditional championship mode, the player can also participate in the arcade mode in which a certain performance must be met in order to qualify to the next event. Unlockable by winning the Decathlon is a special mode with three additional disciplines: hurdles (200 and 400 metres) and 100 metres relay race.\nThe player creates an athlete who is saved on the cartridge and can be improved by training. <br><br>Up to two players can participate simultaneously; some disciplines also offer a hot-seat option with only one cartridge. Best times and a ghost can be transferred via infrared. A side effect of this feature is the possibility to race against the own ghost.",
