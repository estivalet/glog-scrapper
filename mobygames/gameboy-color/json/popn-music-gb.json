  "description": "<i>pop'n music GB</i> is a scaled-down version of Konami's long-running <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=pop%27n+music+series\">pop'n music</a> franchise. Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the &quot;groove meter&quot; increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.<br><br>The 9 buttons of the original game have been reduced to 5 for the Game Boy's control setup, and there are 25 tracks included; 15 arranged tracks from the first three arcade and console releases, along with 10 new original tracks. The game includes a single-player Original mode, as well as a 2-player Versus mode.",
