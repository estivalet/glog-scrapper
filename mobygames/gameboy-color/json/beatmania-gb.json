  "description": "<i>beatmania GB</i> is one of the many releases in Konami's long-running <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=beatmania\">beatmania</a> rhythm game series, and the first for the Game Boy. The game features 8-bit renditions of 10 selected songs from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/beatmania_\">2nd MIX, Yebisu MIX</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/beatmania-append-3rd-mix\">3rd MIX</a>, plus a further 10 new songs original to this release, for a total of 20 songs. Gameplay is identical to its arcade and console big brother: notes scroll down the screen in time with the music, and the appropriate buttons must be pressed in order to play along and complete the song. The game includes arcade and free play modes, along with a 2-player versus mode playable via the Game Boy link cable.",
