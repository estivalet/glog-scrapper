  "description": "<i>Power Pro-kun Pocket</i> is a 1999 arcade Baseball simulator developed by Diamond Head and published by Konami for the Game Boy Color. It was designed as a spinoff of <i>Jikkyou Pawafuru Puroyaky? 5</i>, and is set apart by its darker storytelling with slight fantasy elements.<br><br>The game's main feature is its &quot;Success&quot; story scenario, &quot;Extreme High School Edition&quot;, which follows a student who transfers to a very decrepit school and must convince his classmates to join his Baseball team after the club collapses on top of the former corrupt staff. The player must manage the protagonist's weekly routine to train, meet new teammates and date one out of a few love interests. Failing to keep the protagonist healthy, being unable to keep the Baseball club running or losing a late-game match results in a game over which erases the player's save file. One can reset the game to prevent a game over, but there are restrictions and penalties for doing so.<br><br>Upon clearing the Success mode with any ending, the player can use the resulting character to build a custom team for playing Baseball on the Exhibition mode. Matches between two people who own the game and a link cable are supported.<br><br>In 2004, a compilation remake of this game and its sequel was released for the Game Boy Advance.",
