  "description": "Acclaim's baseball series returns to the Game Boy Color with <i>All-Star Baseball 2001</i>. Little has changed compared to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/all-star-baseball-2000_\">predecessor</a>, with the major differences being updated stats and rosters for the 2000 MLB season, improved animations and AI, an overhauled frontend, and the addition of a Hall of Fame team.<br><br>All previous game modes return: exhibition, season, playoffs, all-star game, Home Run Derby and batting practice. Besides the Hall of Fame team, all 30 regular teams of the 2000 season are available. Gameplay on the field remains largely unchanged from the previous year, with pitching and batting seen from behind the batter, and running and fielding from an isometric perspective of the field. Controls are also unchanged, allowing for a variety of pitches and swings.",
