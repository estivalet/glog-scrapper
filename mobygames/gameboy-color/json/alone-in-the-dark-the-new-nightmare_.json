  "description": "Edward Carnby, private eye of the paranormal, is back. His best friend, Charles Fiske, has been found dead near Shadow Island--a mysterious island near Maine. It is his duty to take up the investigation and find out the secrets of Shadow Island. The game takes place in the surrounding grounds of a gloomy mansion. The game tries to import most of the gameplay mechanics of its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/alone-in-the-dark-the-new-nightmare\">console/Windows</a> brother: most time is spent exploring the game world (screens with switching camera perspectives), collecting items and using them to solve puzzles. <br><br>Besides the obvious technical changes due to the restricted power of the Game Boy Color system, there are two important differences: There is no choice of characters, and if the player is attacked (mostly on pre-defined points, in some areas randomly) the game switches to a different playing mode. The perspective is somewhere between isometric and top-down, and the player has to kill the approaching enemies - he can turn in eight directions and has to aim in the general direction. Consistently to the previous entries of this series the ammo is scarce.",
