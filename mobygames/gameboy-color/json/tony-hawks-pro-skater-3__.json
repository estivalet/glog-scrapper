  "description": "<i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</i> returns with an all new line-up of skaters and an all new line-up of parks to crash through.<br><br>The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course). All characters have different skills in abilities like spin or balance.<br><br>The player uses items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase the score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as possible. The main difference to the other versions of the game is the level design and perspective: The environments are side-scrolling and linear. However, there are several of those tracks side-by-side which can be switched at ramps. There are three playing modes: career (a campaign through all nine levels), single session (accumulating as many points as possible within a time limit) and free skating.",
