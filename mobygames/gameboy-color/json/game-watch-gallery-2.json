The more stars a player has, the more additional features they unlock, including a sound test, additional Game &amp; Watch games (in classic form only), and a sixth modernized game:<br><br><li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Game+%26+Watch%3a+Ball\">Ball</a>: Juggle a collection of objects.  Unlike the other games in the collection, dropping one instantly ends the game.</li><br>",
