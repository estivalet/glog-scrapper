  "description": "In <i>Billy Bob's Huntin'-n-Fishin'</i> the player takes the role of Billy Bob, an obese redneck, who wants to win the heart of his love Daisy Mae. But she makes high demands: her lover needs to be a skilled hunter and fisherman. Two attributes which don't fit Billy. The only way to change this is by solving a variety of simple mini games, e.g. a shooting gallery or catching worms by walking to the hole and pressing the button with the correct timing. Those mini games can be tackled in any order and when all in a category (fishing or hunting) are finished, the player gets access to the main assignment. This plays out with another, slightly more complex mini game. All this has to be repeated five times with increasing difficulty in order to beat the game.",
