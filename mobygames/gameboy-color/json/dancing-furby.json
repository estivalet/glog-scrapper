  "description": "As a furby you must dance! Woo-teh-loh-wah-boo! <i>Shake it to the left, shake it to the right</i>.<br><br>A Furby is an owl-like monster with fluffy pink banana ears. They love to dance, sing, and slowly learn human speech. Specifically a Furby is an autonomous toy robot manufactured by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Tiger+Electronics\">Tiger Electronics</a>, licensor of this game. These toys were among the first successful domestic robots. Here they will be dancing for you. <br><br><i>Dancing Furby</i> operates as a classic rhythm game, with a line of button prompts scrolling across the screen that you will have to press when they reach the current time mark, supposedly matched with the music.  A Furby on screen will dance in accordance with your performance, commenting on your timing in Furbish, &quot;noo-loo&quot; being perfect, &quot;e-day&quot; being acceptable, and &quot;boo&quot; is shrilled for failure. At the end of each song you'll have you score calculated in &quot;noo-loo&quot;'s etc. and then be allowed to continue.<br><br>Successfully clearing a stage will result in you being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared port with the matching port on the forehead of a Furby toy. This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching it to warble Für Elise when you least expect it.<br><br>You may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. Good performance will unlock more Furbies.<br><br>Songs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Für Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.",
