  "description": "A soldier named Alleron is accused of being a necromancer. He is thrown into prison full of skeleton warriors and other terrifying monsters. The only way to prove his innocence is to survive, and exact revenge against those who put him in this predicament. But that won't be easy, since even more loathsome creatures guard all the exits on his way to freedom...<br><br>This version of <i>Warriors of Might and Magic</i> differs from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/warriors-of-might-and-magic__\">console version</a> by being a top-down, 2D action game with slight RPG elements. The emphasis on combat in this version manifests itself in the fact that boss encounters have been added as additional challenges on each level. The level design itself, however, also differs from that of the console version. ",
