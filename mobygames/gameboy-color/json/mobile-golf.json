  "description": "<i>Mobile Golf</i> is sort of a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mario-golf-\">Mario Golf</a>, and has very similar gameplay and storyline. The game starts out with four normal human golfers who must be trained in an RPG-like fashion by playing golf. Other characters can be unlocked by beating them, including the four champions of the game and some more familiar Mario characters, such as Mario, Princess Peach, Yoshi, and Foreman Spike from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wrecking-crew\">Wrecking Crew</a>. The game features connection to the Game Boy Color's online service, the Mobile Adapter GB, which is how some characters are unlocked.",
