  "description": "<i>Chase H.Q. - Secret Police</i>, is slightly different than the other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game_group/sheet/gameGroupId,1493\">Chase H.Q. games</a>. You receive a call from Dispatch, telling you to arrest suspects that have just committed a felony. There are ten stages in the game, and each one of them has you placing three agents throughout the city. Each one of these agents have their own specialties. Once you have placed the agents, you must guide one of them toward the suspect vehicle. If the vehicle goes outside the city, the game is over.<br><br>Once the two of you make contact, the battle begins where the object is to ram the suspect's vehicle until it is disabled. You can also shoot the vehicle to further damage it, and use up to three turbos to catch up with the vehicle if you happen to fall behind. \n",
