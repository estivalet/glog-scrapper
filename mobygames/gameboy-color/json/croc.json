  "description": "All is not well in Croc's world.  His friends, the Gobbos, have been captured by the evil Baron Dante.  It is Croc's mission to reach Dante's castle to free the Gobbos.<br><br><i>Croc</i> is a standard side-scrolling platformer. The levels progress generally from left to right with some vertical movement. However, Croc also has to explore a bit on the side in order to find keys and bonus areas with rewards. Those are usually either extra lives, shortcuts or crystals which also serve as life energy: every time Croc is hit, one crystal is lost. Croc's main abilities consist of jumping, pouncing, and using his tail to get rid of enemies. In some levels, he also has to swim or ski.<br><br>The game features about 30 levels divided into four areas (jungle, desert, ice world and the castle itself) as well as bonus rounds between levels like a sliding puzzle.",
