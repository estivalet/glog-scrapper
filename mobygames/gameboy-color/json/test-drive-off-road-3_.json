  "description": "The <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/test-drive-off-road-3\">third game</a> in the off-road spin-off of the <i>Test Drive</i> series received an adaptation for the Game Boy Color. It offers eight licensed off-road trucks from manufacturers like Jeep, Dodge, Ford and Subaru and seven international areas to race in, each with three different tracks. Further cars and tracks are available as hidden bonuses. Races are seen from a top-down perspective.<br><br>The modes are similar to those in the developer's earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/test-drive-6_\">Test Drive 6</a>. The main gameplay mode is Tournament Mode. Seven different cups are available that have to be taken on in order, unlocking tracks in the process. Winnings from races can be spent to purchase new cars. After every race, power up points are awarded that can be used to improve the car in acceleration, top speed, traction and gearing. It is also possible to equip the car with a GPS, which provides a map of the track during a race, and with further enhancements, the locations of all drivers. Also available are power bursts and power winches. Bursts give a short speed burst, while winches can be used to quickly reset the car to a checkpoint if it becomes stuck at an obstacle like mud or water.<br><br>Single Race mode allow players to race on unlocked tracks with their purchased cars. In Patrol Chase mode, players can select from special cop variants of three different cars, with the goal being chasing down the other cars on the track and giving them tickets by ramming into them.<br><br>The game cartridge (US version only) has a rumble feature that lets players experience all the bumps and rough terrain first-hand.",
