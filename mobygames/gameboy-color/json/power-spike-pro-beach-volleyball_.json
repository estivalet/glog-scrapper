  "description": "<i>Power Spike: Pro Beach Volleyball</i> for the Game Boy Color is the handheld version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Power+Spike%3a+Pro+Beach+Volleyball\">console game with the same name</a>. Like the original game it carries a license to include professional beach volleyball players from the real sport. There are eleven teams in total, six men's teams and five women's teams. The game is played from a side view perspective that scrolls from side to side. The control pad is used for moving around, the A button is used to bump, set, spike and throw the ball while the B is used to jump and block shots.<br><br>There are three game modes: single match, championship and versus game. The single match mode is for practising playing the game with any of the included teams. In the tournament mode the player enters competitions that are gradually unlocked. By winning tournaments the player can also unlock secret modes and a hidden court. The versus game is for two player multiplayer matches that are played over a link cable. ",
