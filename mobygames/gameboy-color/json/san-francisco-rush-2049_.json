  "description": "<i>San Francisco Rush 2049</i> for Game Boy Color is a loose adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/san-francisco-rush-2049\">arcade/console game of the same name</a>. Besides employing 2D graphics appropriate to the platform, it features different tracks and a limited selection of modes and cars.<br><br>The game includes five different cars (all of which handle differently) and nine tracks. Only the first track can be chosen from the start. Subsequent tracks are unlocked by placing third place or higher in a circuit race on the previous track. Once a track is unlocked, it can also be used for a time trial race.<br><br>The races are shown in a pseudo-3D bird's eye view, with tunnels and signs sometimes obscuring the racers. A major gameplay element is picking up power-up icons: the turbo icon delivers a short speed burst, necessary for beating the competition. There is also a grip icon that temporarily improves handling. Oil slicks on the tracks should be avoided.",
