  "description": "<i>Momotar? Densetsu 1?2</i> is a port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/momotar-densetsu-turbo\">Momotar? Densetsu Turbo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/momotar-densetsu-ii\">Momotar? Densetsu II</a> on one cartridge, presented as one whole game; it is necessary to complete <i>Turbo</i> before <i>II</i> can be played. The game balance has been tweaked to make the game easier, and some of the particularly dated jokes have been rewritten, but the games are otherwise more or less identical to the original releases.",
