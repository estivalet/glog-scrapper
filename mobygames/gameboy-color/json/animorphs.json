  "description": "Based on Scholastic's popular books and television series, <i>Animorphs</i> is a 2D action / RPG hybrid.  The evil Yeerks are invading Earth and only the Animorphs can stop them with their morphing power.  Play as all five members of the Animorphs and collect DNA from animals you meet - now you have the power to morph into these animals.  Keep your morphing power a secret from the regular humans, and use the correct morph at the right time to escape from tricky situations. Every animal has certain advantages and drawbacks against certain enemies. Play through five RPG levels with turn-based combat and five 2D minigames in order to defeat the Yeerks and save the planet.",
