  "description": "<i>Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2</i> is another handheld entry in the long-running series. It has little in common with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/army-men-sarges-heroes-2\">the game of the same name on consoles</a>, having a completely different gameplay style and story.<br><br>Players control soldiers of the Green Army in combat against the Tan Army through 30 levels. Before each mission, one of three characters can be selected: Vikki, Scorch, and Riff. Levels are seen from an isometric perspective. Mission objectives vary between search and destroy (find and kill all enemies), search and rescue (find an item or soldier), protection/escort (defend a base or friendly unit) and more. All action is vehicle-based, and each of the three characters comes with their own set of three craft, one each for land, air and sea-based missions. Vehicles are equipped with a primary and a more powerful secondary gun. Ammunition for the latter is limited but can be replenished by picking up the appropriate power-up, which is sometimes hidden inside enemy buildings that have to be destroyed first.<br><br>Progress through the game is saved via passwords. Between levels, comic-style images illustrate the storyline.",
