  "description": "The last Madden game on the Game Boy Color is very similar to its immediate predecessor, offering most of the same features, the main difference being updated player stats for the 2001 NFL season.<br><br>Besides exhibition games, there are season and playoff modes with password support. The two-player mode via link cable also returns. The playbook of more than 80 offense and 60 defense plays is reused from the previous game, as are features like audibles and substitutions.",
