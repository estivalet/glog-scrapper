  "description": "In the international edition of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lagaf-les-aventures-de-moktar-vol-1-la-zoubida\">Lagaf: Les Aventures de Moktar - Vol 1: La Zoubida</a>, you play Titus' fox mascot. His beloved Suzy has been kidnapped on the other side of the Sahara desert, and to get her back he has to advance through 15 levels (with codes for each one) comprising of nearly 1000 screens of platform gameplay, scrolling in 8 directions. <br><br>There are secret rooms to find, and bosses at the end of each level. The player can also interact with many parts of the background. Using available objects such as springs and crates correctly is often vital to progress. Alternate modes of transport such as Magic Carpets and Skateboards also make an appearance.",
