  "description": "<i>10-Pin Bowling</i> is a bowling game for one or two players.<br><br>Each player is given the choice to enter his or her name and after that the game begins. Users can charge up their shots and adjust the speed and your curve using the D-pad. If the player takes too long, a red bar will be hit and the throw will become a foul. The player can pause the game, view the score boards and change the rumble settings. There is no option for playing against computer controlled opponents.",
