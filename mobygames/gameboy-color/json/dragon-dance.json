  "description": "<i>Dragon Dance</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a> variant with power ups similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a>. Like in those games the objective is to destroy bricks with the use of a ball but with the difference that the paddle used to do so here is a dragon which when still curls up in a ball. For every ball that the player loses the dragon will shrink until there is nothing left of it. There is also a time limit for every level so the player can not take too long. Therefore it's possible to increase the speed level of the ball but there is no way to decrease it except by losing a ball (and restarting with a new one) or by getting a specific power up. Other power ups include those that add extra time or increase the dragon's movement speed. The player can also transform his dragon into other types of dragons that have special abilities. These become available as the player destroys bricks and is represented by a power gauge at the top of the screen. These abilities include freezing time, deflecting the ball in mid-air, shooting fireballs that destroy bricks and a web that can block off certain paths through the level. Random events featuring dragon gods can happen and will lead to different effects such as earthquakes or restored health.<br><br>The game consists of one hundred levels with every tenth being a boss level. There is also a versus mode where two players can link up against each other. The players choose one of ten levels and compete in trying to clear the most bricks. For every five seconds the player with the least bricks cleared during that time gets an extra row of bricks added. The one that clears his screen first will win. ",
