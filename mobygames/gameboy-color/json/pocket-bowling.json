  "description": "<i>Pocket Bowling</i> brings bowling to the Game Boy Color. It offers single games for one or two players, a tournament mode consisting of four rounds and progress stored via passwords, and a practice option that allows setting up any pin combination to knock down.<br><br>Before a game, players can select from five different characters, each with different statistics, and select whether they are right- or left-handed. After aligning the ball on the alley, the throwing is done with four consecutive button pushes. The first starts the curve meter, while the second stops it to select the ball curve. The third determines the power of the throw on the power meter, and the final one must be matched to a goal spot for best accuracy.",
