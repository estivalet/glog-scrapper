  "description": "Officially licensed by the old Wembley stadium, this football game is essentially an advanced version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=European+Champions+%281993%29\">Ocean's European Champions</a>. Gameplay emphasizes one-touch passing, with a picture-in-picture window displayed when you prepare to play a long pass, which increases you chances of finding the target player. The AGA version was the first floppy-based game to supports a CD32 controller, making it easier to execute moves. 64 international teams are included, with the chance to play a full league competition or a World Cup. Full control over formation and tactics is offered before the match.",
