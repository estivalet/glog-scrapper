  "description": "<i>Heimdall 2: Into the Hall of Worlds</i> is an isometric adventure platform game. In the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/heimdall\">game's predecessor</a>, Heimdall retrieved the three weapons stolen by Loki and stripped him of some of his power for his treason to the others gods. In the second part Loki's warriors, Hakrats, ravaged the lands of Midgard and Utgard in revenge against the Asgard gods who exiled him. Odin and the other gods discussed what action shall be done to permanently stop Loki. They recollected the story of an amulet with enough power to imprison a god. It was shattered into four pieces and each piece was sent into a different world. The journey to recover all the amulet pieces was undertaken by Baldur but he was entrapped by Loki. Knowing this the elder gods decided to send a god who had enough experience as a mortal - the choice was given to Heimdall, son of Odin, guardian of the Asgard gods. They also sent Valkyrie named Ursha who was supposed to help him.<br><br>Heimdall and Ursha must travel through different nordic worlds in search for answers, weapons and pieces of amulet. During the quest the player may change the characters but in some sections both characters are needed in order to complete the game. <br><br>The player travels through different lands of Nordic Worlds, fighting with enemies (with sword, bow and arrow or magic) and solving puzzles that are mostly about finding an object and bringing it to the person who needs it, figuring out the proper combination of some items or goods or finding a way through the maze. During the game you can change the character between man and woman.",
