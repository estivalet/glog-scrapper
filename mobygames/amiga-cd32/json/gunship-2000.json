  "description": "Take the Apache, the new Longbow Apache, The Blackhawk, Comanche Scout, Comanche Gunship, or the MD-500 Defender on campaigns or missions. Updated graphics engine has much more detailed terrain variation with true valleys/hills and even train tunnels that you can fly through. When you are promoted to a sufficient rank you can take along multiple helicopters to accomplish your objectives. The dynamic campaign generates new missions based on multiple maps. Attack, defend, sweep, scout, rescue, drop... Lots of missions to keep you busy. Crew learn and grow in experience as they survive and succeed. A full mission recorder allows you to view EVERY member of your team as they fight or die. Plenty of weapons are available for your side from the latest Hellfire missiles and Sidearm anti-radar missiles to the old fashioned chain gun and gun pods are available for your use. The enemy can be well armed as well, from deadly 2S6 gun/missile combo to old-fashion ZSU-23, even the occasional MiGs. ",
