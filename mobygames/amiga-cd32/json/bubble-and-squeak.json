  "description": "<i>Bubble and Squeak</i> starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.<br><br>Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.<br><br>Bubble Mode is an equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Mario\">Super Mario mode</a> - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.<br><br>In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater – completing these earns bonuses.",
