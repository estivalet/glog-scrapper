  "description": "A vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up from the old school, with similarities to games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1942arcade\">1942</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=SWIV\">SWIV</a>. There are lots of big, brash enemy vehicles to take on, plus individual soldiers (these often lie in a pool of blood afterwards, a gruesome sight making full use of AGA graphics) and civilians. Many of the enemies have good hiding places and can emerge surprisingly, Commando-style.<br><br>There are four large levels, which also scroll a small amount horizontally, the idea being that you can evade some opposition. There's a special loop-the-loop type feature available, which can double as an attack or an evasive move. ",
