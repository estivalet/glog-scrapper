  "description": "This horizontally scrolling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=R-Type%27\">R-Type</a>-influenced shoot 'em up features 5 levels to blast through, with bosses at the end of each level as well as tough mini-bosses as you go through it. There are four difficulty levels, with the easiest acting as a trainer, as you can't reach the final level or complete the game properly with it. You can customize exactly how loud the music and sound effects are relative to each other, and there lots of subtle visual effects, such as a smoke haze coming off your ship as it incurs gradual damage.<br><br>The game's power-up system is worthy of note. Rather than simply picking up new weapons, or all-purpose tokens which can be traded in at the press of a button, you collect blueprints for a total of 32 different weapons as well as upgrades to the maximum amount of power your ship can unleash at a time. Once you reach a power-up bay (which are depicted as blue domes at the base of the level), you can add or remove weapons so as to maximize your attack capabilities.",
