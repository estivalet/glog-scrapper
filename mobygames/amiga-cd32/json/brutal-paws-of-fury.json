  "description": "The Dalai Llama has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. <br><br><i>Brutal: Paws of Fury</i> is a one-on-one fighting game across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. <br><br>During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a &quot;taunt&quot; that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. <br><br>Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. <br><br>The visuals lean towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a> and the metal of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rise-of-the-robots\">Rise of the Robots</a>.<br><br>In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though. ",
