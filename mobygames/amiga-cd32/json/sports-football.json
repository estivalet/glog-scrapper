  "description": "<i>Amiga CD³² Sports: Football</i> has three play modes: arcade, coach and commissioner. In arcade mode, the player has full control over all players on the field. In coach mode, only strategy decisions are made and the computer plays the game. In the third mode, the game plays entirely by itself and the player only watches.<br><br>The player can select from 28 teams within a league. All players in the team have individual stats and can be substituted. During a match plays can be selected to set the next move for the player's team. Some limited control during the match in coach mode is possible, for example the player can choose who the runner should pass to next.<br><br>An extensive practice mode allows the player to practice all the available moves in the game. Other features include different weather conditions and live audio commentary.",
