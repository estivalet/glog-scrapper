  "description": "<i>Raging Fighter</i> is a one-against-one fighting game. The background scenario is the Omega League which is supposed to sift out the best fighter in the universe. Each of the seven fighters has a variety of punches and kills - which one gets performed depends on which directions on the d-pad are pressed. Every fighter differs from the others with two special attacks which are triggered by pressing the right button combination and a few statistics like speed or defense. Besides the story mode, the player can also participate in the training mode with a motionless opponent, a tournament or two-player matches. The winner of a match is whoever wins two rounds out of three.",
