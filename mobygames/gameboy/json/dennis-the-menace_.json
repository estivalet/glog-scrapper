  "description": "A portable version of the game based on the movie of the same name. Dennis runs, jumps and fights his way through 16 stages (divided among 6 levels) to find Switchblade Sam and liberate Mr. Wilson's stolen wealth. He'll be going through Mr. Wilson's House, the Spooky Forest, the Sewers, the Adventure Park, the School and finally the Boiler Room.<br><br>Although Dennis' choice of weapon is a slingshot, he can also tackle enemies with a pea shooter and water pistol all of which have unlimited ammo. Sometimes one of the three weapons are more effective on certain enemies. Around some parts of the Adventure Park, Dennis is required to swim his way. Three of the levels are boss levels (such as the Sewer Worker, the Gym Teacher and Switchblade Sam himself), where Dennis must repeatedly shoot the boss enemies while dodging hazards.",
