  "description": "<i>Pokémon Yellow</i>, along with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-blue-version\">Pokémon Blue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-red-version\">Pokémon Red</a> forms the first generation of Pokémon games.  You control a number of fictional animals known as Pokémon and must travel the land using your current Pokémon to defeat and capture more.  <br><br>There are 151 Pokémon that fall into various types such as fire, water and grass that have a complicated rock-paper-scissors relationship.  You come across a series of town, each of which contains a gym where you must do battle with other Pokémon trainers.  Each gym specializes in a different type of Pokémon.  After beating each gym, you are given a new ability that lets you travel to new areas.<br><br>The object of the game is to defeat all eight gym leaders, or ultimately, to catch all the varieties of Pokémon.  Some of them are not actually catchable in <i>Yellow</i>, so you must use the Game Boy link function to trade with friends using <i>Red</i> and <i>Blue</i> to complete your collection.<br><br><i>Pokémon Yellow</i> differs from the other first-generation games because it is based on the Pokémon anime series.  The main character looks like Ash and he starts the game with Pikachu, rather than choosing a Pokémon as in all other games in the series.  Character graphics throughout the game are based on designs from the series and it includes Jesse, James and their Meowth, which the other games do not.",
