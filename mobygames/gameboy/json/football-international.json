  "description": "<i>Football International</i> is a top-down soccer game with eight national teams to choose from. The player can either participate in an exhibition match or in a knockout championship. Other options which can be set is the time a half-time lasts and if the own team uses a more defensive or offensive lineup. The game itself consists of the usual dribbling, passing and shooting. Normally the camera closely follows the ball carrier, but when a wide shot is performed it zooms out and shows the whole playfield.",
