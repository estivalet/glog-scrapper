  "description": "In <i>Brain Bender</i>, a single player must shoot a laser into an enemy satellite. If that sounds easy, it isn't... because there are gas spheres and Electrobrains in the way! Not only that, your laser can only fire one way and the satellite is often in the last place you look. Fortunately, the player can manipulate mirrors to reflect the beam and destroy what needs to be destroyed. But you better hurry and get your brain in gear... the clock is ticking!",
