  "description": "<i>Amazin Penguin</i> is a basic action game with a penguin protagonist. Each of the 40 levels consists of a number of lines which divide the playfield into squares. On those lines are switches (represented by a minus) and dots which need to be activated respectively kicked. If all lines around a square are cleared, it gets filled out and all enemies which happen to stand on one of the lines are killed (but respawn shortly after). The goal of the level is to fill all squares out. A life is lost by touching an enemy or running out of time.",
