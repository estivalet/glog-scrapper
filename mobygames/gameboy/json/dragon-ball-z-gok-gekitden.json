  "description": "Based on the anime Dragon Ball Z anime series, the game begins as Kuririn, Gohan and Bulma are attacked by Freeza's henchmen at Namek, and follows the story until the battle between Freeza and Goku. The gameplay is very simillar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dragon-ball-z-gok-hishden\">Dragon Ball Z: Gok? Hish?den</a>, although with some notable differences, as players now have a limited amount of time while choosing a sequence of actions for each turn. Next, the battle will take place in a small map with the heads of the two characters moving around the quadrilater, and a graphic representation of what the characters are doing is illustrated above through anime-like drawings. Next characters need to charge power, aim and attack. A hit damage value shows up on the screen after each impact suffered.",
