  "description": "This game begins with Goku's training with Kami in his floating palace and ends with the battle against Vegeta. The combat mode is RPG/strategy oriented, as the player chooses from a list of options when to move, charge energy, punch, kick, or do any number of different special attacks, then watches as the events take place and awaits for the next turn. You must also take an active part in dodging attacks by pressing appropriate buttons at the right moments (similar to NBA Live 1-point shots, but with a bar instead of a cross). Also, there's a tournament mode, in which you will take the side of Goku as he fought in the 23rd Tenkaichi Bud?kai in the Dragon Ball series.",
