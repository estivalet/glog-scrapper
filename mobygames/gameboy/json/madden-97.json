  "description": "<i>Madden 97</i> is the last appearance of the series on the original Game Boy. Coming from developer Tiertex, it is based closely on their <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/madden-96_\">Madden 96 for Game Gear</a>, with similar menus and options, but with platform-appropriate graphics and no digitized speech. Like earlier Game Boy titles in the franchise, <i>Madden 97</i> does not feature an NFL license, so offers only generic team names. Still, teams and stats are based on the 1996 NFL season.<br><br>Game modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Sudden Death. 30 regular teams plus the traditional All-Madden team are available. Besides the usual features like selectable game length, freely definable audibles, flippable playbook, timeouts and substitutions, previously Game Gear-only features making their first appearance on the Game Boy include variable weather and injuries.",
