  "description": "This version of <i>FIFA '97</i> is different from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/fifa-soccer-97_\">console</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/fifa-soccer-97_\">counterparts</a>. Besides the obvious graphic and sound limitations, this version does not feature any national leagues, instead offering 51 international teams to choose from plus the all-star THQ Tornados.<br><br>It still features the traditional game modes, <i>Exhibition</i>, <i>Tournament</i>, <i>Playoff</i> and <i>League</i> along with the standard set of rules and moves from the world of soccer (yellow and red cards, sliding tackles and lightning quick goalie reactions).",
