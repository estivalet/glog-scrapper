  "description": "A one-on-one fighting game based on the manga of the same name. The game puts you in the shoes of a newcomer to the Otoko Jyuku school. A special boarding school for unruly teenagers that instills discipline by adopting feudal codes of conduct and pitting its students against each other in constant duels.<br><br>As expected the game focuses on the duels, represented as one-on-one side scrolling fights in which your character (armed with a bo-stick) must defeat a series of contenders in succession, each armed with their own weapons.<br><br>Features a single-player &quot;story&quot; mode, which includes cutscenes composed of still images that advance the story between each match, and a Vs. mode for two-player gameplay.",
