  "description": "<i>Atomic Punk</i>, which was released as <i>Dynablaster</i> in Europe and <i>Bomber Boy</i> in Japan, is a game from Hudson Soft's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Bomberman\">Bomberman series</a>. <br><br>The game offers two single player and two multiplayer modes. The single player mode called &quot;Game B&quot; has the classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode &quot;Game A&quot; introduces several variations. The levels in Game A are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called &quot;panels&quot; in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area.<br><br>The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In &quot;Panel mode&quot;, each player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In &quot;Powerful mode&quot;, no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.",
