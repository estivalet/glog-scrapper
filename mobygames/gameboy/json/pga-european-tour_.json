  "description": "This game lets players compete on the PGA European Tour. It features the Forest of Arden, Wentworth, Crans Sur Sierre, and Valderrama golf courses.<br><br>Players can either choose to practice a round, play in a tournament, or compete in a skins challenge. Before players head out to the links they can choose whether to use a standard, match, skill, or power set of clubs and whether to use an amateur or professional tee.<br><br>At each hole, players are given an overhead view of the course. Here they are given a draw/fade meter which effects how the ball is hit.\nAfter that is selected, a view of the golfer is shown with a power meter that ranges from 0 to 100%. The amount of power and the club used will effect the distance the golf swing will have on the ball.",
