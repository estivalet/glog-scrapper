  "description": "<i>4-in-1 Funpak: Volume II</i> gives you, like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4-in-1-fun-pak\">predecessor</a>, four family-friendly games in one cart. There are some differences, however. First, of course, the selection of games differs. The games are <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/solitaire\">Solitaire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/browser/domino\">Dominoes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/king-cribbage\">Cribbage</a> and Yacht (using <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/yahtzee\">Yahtzee's</a> rules). You can play against the CPU or a second player, using the same Game Boy or, if you have the game link cable, two Game Boys. Unlike the previous cart, there is no skill selection.",
