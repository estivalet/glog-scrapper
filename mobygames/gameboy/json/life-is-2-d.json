  "description": "<i>Life Is 2-D</i> is a fangame, recreating the entire first episode of the <i>Life Is Strange</i> series, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/life-is-strange-episode-1-chrysalis\">Life Is Strange: Episode 1 - Chrysalis</a>, as a Game Boy game using the style of classic Game Boy RPGs. The core concept is completely identical, with the full story, conversation options and the different paths through the rewind mechanic. Visually the game is very different using a bird's-eye view and direct control to move the character Maxine around.",
