  "description": "As Great Greed begins, you are accidentally warped to another dimension by a wizard by the name of “Microwave”. With no immediate way back, you help the people fight off the scourge named “Bio-Haz” who is consuming this dimension with evil and destruction.<br><br>This new dimension you find yourself in is not terribly unlike the one you came from, with the exception that everyone is named after foods or food-related items and most of the monsters appear to be mutated vegetables and the like.<br><br>This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few respects. The battle system does not use any menus, switching all commands to simple button pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will run and the D-Pad is shortcuts to certain spells. The combat is also live, in the sense that if you take too long to complete your turn, your opponent will attack again.<br><br>Using a battery-backed save system, the game will automatically auto-save after every successful battle. \n",
