  "description": "In the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tetris\">Tetris</a> comes <i>Wordtris</i>. Falling letters must be placed in order to form words in order to clear them away. Occasionally bombs will fall which you may use to clear away a single letter or an entire stack of them, depending on the type of bomb. The larger the words you form, the higher points you receive. If you clear enough words without filling up the screen, you move on to the next level.",
