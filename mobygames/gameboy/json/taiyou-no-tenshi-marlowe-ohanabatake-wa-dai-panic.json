  "description": "The angel Marlowe has a problem: he's on his way to a date with Nancy, but every flower in Bloomland has wilted! This just won't do. Luckily he stumbles across a small sun, named Phillip, and comes up with a solution: by shining light on every flower, they can quickly grow back up. This action-puzzle game is a bit like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/qix\">Qix</a> in reverse. Players control Marlowe as he flies around in a stage from an overhead view; meanwhile, Phillip moves on his own around a set path on either the outside of the level or the centre of a level. Pressing the A button fires a light beam from Phillip to Marlowe's position, hitting anything in the middle. Hitting a flower with a sunbeam will help it grow, with most flowers taking a few hits to grow completely. Enemies wander the stage, but hitting them with a sunbeam takes them out temporarily; sometimes, they'll drop powerup items as well. Holding B also speeds up Phillip, granting a little extra control over stages. Players start the game with a choice of several themed worlds, which they can complete in any order, and must complete all of the worlds in order to finish the game.",
