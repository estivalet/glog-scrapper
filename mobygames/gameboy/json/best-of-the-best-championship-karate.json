  "description": "<i>Best of the Best Championship Karate</i> is a realistic fighting game.\nAfter you choose your fighter for his parameters (strength, stamina and resistance), you can choose from 55 different moves.\nYou can now train your fighter at a gym before the real fights.\nTo master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance.\nBe careful, losing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting in the ring!\n",
