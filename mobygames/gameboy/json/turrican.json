  "description": "Three-headed demon Morgul has been influencing people's dreams to create nightmares, but more recently these nightmares have become real. Only <i>Turrican</i> can save them in this fast paced side scrolling shoot-em up. It features 5 worlds and 13 levels of challenging gameplay.<br><br>Gameplay is conceptually simple: just jump, shoot and explore. However, this game puts a lot of emphasis on finding and using the 10 different weapons Turrican can collect.",
