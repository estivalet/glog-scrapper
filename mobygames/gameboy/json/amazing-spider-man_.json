  "description": "One of Spider-Man's enemies has discovered his true identity, Peter Parker, and kidnapped his girlfriend Mary Jane. Unfortunately for Spidey, exactly who has kidnapped her is a mystery.  So, you must guide Spider-Man through five levels to find where she is hidden.<br><br><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> is a side-scrolling action game. Spider-Man can use his web making abilities to either hang from the ceiling or shoot webs out like bullets, but most of his attacks are punches or kicks. Also included are two vertical-scrolling building climbing segments in which Spider-Man has to avoid enemies and falling objects which try to knock him down. His spider sense rings a few moments earlier so you have enough time to react.",
