  "description": "The 1994 Cameron/Schwarzenegger action film <i>True Lies</i> received a unique adaptation for handheld systems. While based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/true-lies\">console version</a>, it adapts only five of the nine levels, featuring a different gameplay perspective (straight top-down instead of the angled perspective on the consoles) and completely redesigned stages.<br><br>Players control secret agent Harry Tasker, who is out to save the free world from bad guy Aziz, leader of Islamic terror group Crimson Jihad. All levels are based on action set pieces from the film and include the infiltration of the chateau, the pursuit of Aziz in the mall and in the park and the final confrontation in the office building. In each level, Harry is set with a certain task: connecting a modem to a computer to download data, finding Aziz, or disarming a nuclear device. Hordes of terrorists stand in his way and must be taken out with a variety of guns. Harry starts a level only with a standard pistol that has unlimited ammo but must still be reloaded after 15 shots. He must pick up more powerful guns like a machine gun, a shotgun, grenades and mines. Ammunition for each of these must be collected separately. The terrorists are armed with similar weapons but also some heavier ones like grenade launchers and flamethrowers. Some civilians can also be found walking around the levels. These should not be shot: killing three means restarting the level. Health powerups and extra lives can be found lying about the levels. ",
