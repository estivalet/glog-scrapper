  "description": "<i>Disney's Hercules</i> is based on the animated movie of the same name. Besides the source material, there is no connection to the movie-based games on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Disney%27s+Hercules\">other platforms</a>. <br><br>The player takes the role of Hercules who has to travel through nine levels in order to prove himself a worthy son of Zeus. Regarding gameplay, this is a standard side-scrolling platformer. The goal is to traverse from the left to the right and avoid death by touching enemies too often (Hercules has a health bar) or by falling into holes. Hercules also possesses a melee weapon which can be used to kill enemies. In some sections he mans Pegasus, the winged horse.",
