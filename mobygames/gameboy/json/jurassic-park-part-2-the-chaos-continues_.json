  "description": "While sharing the name with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/jurassic-park-part-2-the-chaos-continues\">SNES title</a>, the Game Boy version of <i>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues</i> has little in common with its bigger brother except the basic premise.<br><br>The player controls Dr. Alan Grant who returns to the dinosaur island one year after the events of <i>Jurassic Park</i> and must make his way through four zones of two levels each of side-scrolling platforming. The goal in each level is to collect a number of magnetic ID cards which open up the level exit. Many different species of dinosaur stand in Grant's way: walking, flying and even the swimming kind. To defend himself, he has access to a gun as well as hand grenades, both with unlimited ammunition. When going for a swim, the gun turns into a harpoon. When he gets hurt, he can heal himself through medkits that can be found lying about. Extra lives are also available.<br><br>Set between the platforming levels are various boss fights against powerful enemies like a Triceratops, Pteranodon, Velociraptor and T-Rex, each of which requires a unique strategy to defeat.<br><br>Further variation from standard platforming comes in two T-Rex pursuit stages. In these, a T-Rex approaches from the left side of the screen which scrolls to the right automatically, allowing for little to no margin of error in choosing the right path. These levels also contain ID cards. These do not have to be collected, but picking them all up results in an extra life being awarded.",
