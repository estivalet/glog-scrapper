  "description": "This version of <i>Space Invaders</i> is based on the 1994 arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-invaders-dx\">Space Invaders DX</a> but lacks the parody mode of that game. What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black &amp; white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.<br><br>The Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. <br><br>The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional &quot;cosmic versus&quot; mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the &quot;omake mode&quot;, which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.<br><br>The WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black &amp; white) but keeps the versus mode.",
