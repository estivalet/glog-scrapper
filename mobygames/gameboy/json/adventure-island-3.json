  "description": "Your girlfriend is once again kidnapped by aliens, and you have to rescue her, forcing your way through various levels.<br><br>The gameplay and the design haven't much changed since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Adventure+Island+II\">Adventure Island II</a>: there is a world map, you can choose items before starting a level, the levels themselves are quite short (unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/adventure-island\">Adventure Island</a>, where each large level contained several stages). You perform standard &quot;adventure island&quot; activities: ride various types of dinosaurs, throw boomerangs at snails, birds, snakes, and skulls, collect grapes and apples, jump over stones, and of course, ride your old trusty skateboard.",
