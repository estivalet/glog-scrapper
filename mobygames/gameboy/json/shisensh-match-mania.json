  "description": "<i>Match Mania</i> is a conversion of the Mahjong solitaire variant Shisen-Sho. The mahjong tiles lie next to each other on a grid field. The goal is to remove all stones, but only two identical tiles can be removed. Since that alone would be too easy, they are viable if they could be connected with up to three horizontal or vertical lines which do not pass through other tiles or over the playfield border. This version features a normal mode with 50 puzzles and a challenge mode where the player races against the clock.",
