  "description": "<i>Riddick Bowe Boxing</i> is another one of the many boxing games released at the time, but with subtle differences. The HUD contains damage and energy meters along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.<br><br>Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on &quot;Big Daddy&quot; himself, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Riddick+Bowe\">Riddick Bowe</a>.<br><br>The game is practically a copy of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=010086012156\">Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing</a>, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.",
