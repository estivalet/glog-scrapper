  "description": "<i>Splitz</i> is a remake of the 1986 computer game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/split-personalities\">Split Personalities</a>. The gameplay is essentially the same as that game and resembles a sliding puzzle game but has a different set of pictures. Unlike traditional sliding puzzles all the pieces are not on the board from the start but are launched by the player from the top left corner of the board. The pieces can then be pushed horizontally or vertically with the goal being to recreate a picture which can be shown at any time by pressing a button. The game is timed and if a puzzle is not completed fast enough, one of three lives will be lost.<br><br>All features from the original game are retained. This include doors that open and close and that can be used to push pieces out of play. They will then be put pack into the queue and be ready to be launched again. There are also various bonus items that can be pushed into each other for bonus points or time increases. Some items have negative effects such as bombs that explode after five seconds (and take a life away). Bombs have to be pushed out through a door or combined with a water tap to be destroyed. At some places there are cracks in the walls. Pushing a piece into a crack causes it to bounce back to its original position. ",
