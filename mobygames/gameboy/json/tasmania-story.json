  "description": "<i>Tasmania Story</i> was 1990's second-best-selling Japanese movie, about a man looking for the extinct Tasmanian tiger, and his son looking for his father. The tie-in game, however, is nothing but a remake of Pony Canyon's 1984 title <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fruit-panic\">Fruit Panic</a></i>.<br><br>A single-screen platformer, you guide a man with a hat from platform to platform. Since he can't jump by himself, you must use the trampolines to the left and right to make him reach the right platform, where he can pick up cactuses, flowers and other plants. When all plants are picked, the next stage follows. What makes the game hard are the &quot;Tasmanian devils&quot; which hunt your man. By dropping on a devil from above, or laying a bomb for an enemy to walk into, you can temporarily stun them.",
