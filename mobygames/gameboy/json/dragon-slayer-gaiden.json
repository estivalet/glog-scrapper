  "description": "A spin-off from the successful <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dragon+Slayer\">Dragon Slayer</a> series by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Falcom\">Falcom</a>, Dragon Slayer Gaiden casts you once again as the nameless knight who must clear dozens of dungeons and save the land from the ever-present dragons.<br><br>Gameplay differs somewhat from the original Dragon Slayer in that there are now outdoors areas, as well as npcs that send you on specific quests. Combat is still real-time, but a new attack button brings the game closer to other action-rpgs like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Zelda\">Zelda</a>.",
