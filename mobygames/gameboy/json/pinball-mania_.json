  "description": "<i>Pinball Mania</i> is a port of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/pinball-mania\">DOS/Amiga original</a>. All four tables are present and clearly based on the original ones, of course with less bells and whistles regarding graphical and audio presentation. However, there are also major and minor differences in the table design, most notably almost the whole center part of the Jailbreak table was removed. Other examples are one missing center paddle on the Kick-Off and Jackpot tables.",
