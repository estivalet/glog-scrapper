  "description": "In <i>Max</i>, sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/adventures-of-star-saver\">The Adventures of Star Saver</a>, the player takes control over Max and has to save the galaxy from the evil Draco. He has to free seven planets which equal seven side-scrolling platforming levels. Besides the ability to shoot and jump, he also has a climbing rope which can be shot vertically upwards, clings into the level architecture and pulls Max up. After the third contact with the numerous enemies or their bullets, Max dies. Power-ups consist of two upgrades for the gun.",
