  "description": "<i>World Cup 98</i> is a licensed game of the 1998 Football World Cup held in France from June 10 to July 12. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/world-cup-98\">PC and console versions</a> of the same name, this release does not feature official player names. Also, this version of the game features a 2D isometric view instead of the 3D graphics of the previously mentioned title. It uses the same engine and most graphics from the Game Boy version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/fifa-road-to-world-cup-98\">FIFA 98: Road to World Cup</a>.<br><br>",
