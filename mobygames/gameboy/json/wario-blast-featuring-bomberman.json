  "description": "This game is about the same style as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Bomberman+Series\">Bomberman Series</a>. The principal game functions are that you, as either Wario or Bomberman walk around on a level and try to blow up your opponent.<br><br>By blowing up blocks that are blocking your way you can uncover power-ups, that can give you three abilities:\n1) The bombs get a longer blast.\n2) You can place more bombs at once.\n3) You get invulnerable but are also unable to place bombs.<br><br>Every power-up except for the third one works during the entire round and can be increased by picking up more power-ups of the same type.<br><br>In the single-player game, you fight as Wario against different amounts of Bombermen, and at the forth course of every &quot;world&quot; you face a boss.<br><br>In multiplayer, you play as either Wario or Bomberman, and try to blow up your friend / enemy.",
