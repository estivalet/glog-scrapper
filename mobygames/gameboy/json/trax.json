Pitting your tankmanship against a villainous tank master who is creating machine of destruction that has taken over the land.<br><br>You can fire from multiple angles but due to the control limitations of the Game Boy, your vehicle can only turn his turret clockwise.<br><br>There are a few power ups which increase your weapons like explosive cannonballs, multi-direction shots or anti-armor shells. <br><br>The game also features some boss fights as you progress through the game's several different environments, forest, desert, cave, city, and tank factory.",
