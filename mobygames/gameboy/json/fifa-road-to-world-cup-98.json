  "description": "The 98 edition of the FIFA series for the Game Boy differs very little from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/fifa-soccer-97\">immediate predecessor</a> by the same developer. It features the same isometric gameplay graphics, the same teams (51 national teams plus the all-star THQ Tornados) and the same game modes: exhibition matches, tournaments (group stage plus knockout stage), playoffs (only the knockout stage) and a league mode.<br><br>Changes are an entirely new menu frontend and revised controls. In particular, the Game Boy's two buttons no longer distinguish between the strength of kicks with the choice between a goal kick and a pass depending entirely on the situation; the buttons for passes and kicks are now distinct.",
