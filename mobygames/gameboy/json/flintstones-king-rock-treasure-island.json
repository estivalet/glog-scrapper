  "description": "In <i>The Flintstones: King Rock Treasure Island</i>, Fred Flintstone finds a treasure map during work. In order to find said treasure, he needs to solve seven levels, some ending with a boss battle. These are traditional side-scrolling platform levels in which Fred has to jump over gaps and dodge enemies. His weapon of choice are axes which he throws at an angle. <br><br>However, hitting an enemy does not kill them instantly but stuns them; a state where they can be abused as stepping stone. Hitting them while they are stunned kills them, but they respawn when Fred walks back to their starting location or at special skulls - those are mostly placed at sections where Fred can't progress without an artificial staircase.  Of course there are also power ups to collect: most of them only increase the points counter or refresh the life energy, but one allows Fred to ride his pet dinosaur Dino. This allows him to throw axes straight and jump higher, but Dino is lost when hit once.",
