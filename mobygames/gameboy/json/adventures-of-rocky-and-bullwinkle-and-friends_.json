  "description": "The Game Boy version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Adventures+of+Rocky+and+Bullwinkle\">The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle</a> shares the story with the SNES/Genesis title by the same developer. Boris and Natasha have managed to steal some priceless artifacts from Frostbite Falls museum and it is up to Rocky and Bullwinkle to get them back. It is a 2D platformer in which both Rocky and Bullwinkle are playable characters at some points of the game. This version features a different set of locations (the players will visit Frostbite Falls, Football Field, and even the Moon) and two different mini-games: a football and a card game.",
