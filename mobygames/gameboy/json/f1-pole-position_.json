  "description": "<i>F1 Pole Position</i> is a Formula One racing video game released for the Game Boy by Ubisoft. The game is originally known in Japan as <i>Nakajima Satoru Kansh? F-1 Hero GB '92: The Graded Driver</i> which is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nakajima-satoru-kansh-f-1-hero-gb\">Nakajima Satoru Kansh? F-1 Hero GB</a>.<br><br>In comparison to its predecessor, the game has a more realistic approach due to the licensing by Foca to Fuji Television. Modes available are the usual: grand prix, warming up (or training), multi game (or multi player), and options.<br><br>Some other changes (or improvements if possible) in relation to its predecessor: the more detailed background and tracks. Also, making the turns without getting off the track is much more easier due to a better view (even though the track map is still not displayed on the screen).<br><br>During the qualifying and races, &quot;retire&quot; will appear if the player crashes too much, or simply want to stop racing. In the Japanese version, before every race, Satoru Nakajima will give some tips about certain areas of the circuit, while this feature was removed from the Western version. One other difference is that <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,76301/\">Ayrton Senna</a> is included in the Japanese version, while <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,49911/\">Michael Andretti</a> replaces Senna in the Western one.<br><br>In both versions the player has to compete in two full seasons. The rounds are basically split into different parts, in each one a minimum goal must be achieved (to qualify and finish the race x number of times) so that the contract is renewed. If the player fails, the game over screen will pop out.",
