  "description": "<i>Minesweeper</i> is a minesweeping game, just like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Windows\">the one</a> included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.<br><br>Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.<br><br>A second mode is a mission mode (&quot;voyage mode&quot; in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player's ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs.<br><br>The Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version contains an additional mode entitled &quot;Cook's Quest&quot;, in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.",
