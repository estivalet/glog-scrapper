  "description": "Based upon the TV show, MMPR lets the players choose from the five Power Rangers and traverse five levels to fight Rita Repulsa and her endless supply of baddies.  The core of the game is a side-scrolling fighter similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/streets-of-rage\">Streets of Rage</a> with basic controls for each Ranger (one button punches, one jumps while both buttons combined kicks) and unique weapons for each individual ranger.<br><br>Before a level the player can choose which Ranger they want to use and as they progress through each level, not only do they have to fight off bad guys and end level bosses, they also have to avoid various obstacles like pits and falling rocks. There is also a bonus level at the end of each and if the player do well enough, they can extend their life bar.",
