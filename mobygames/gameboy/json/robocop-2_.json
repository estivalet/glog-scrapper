  "description": "<i>RoboCop 2</i> is based on the 1990 movie of the same name. The game allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scrolling run and gun game. RoboCop can move left, right, duck and jump. Using his gun the player can shoot enemies. Enemies will shoot back which reduces RoboCops number of hearts. Hearts can be restored by picking up power-ups. When enemies get close the player can also punch them. RoboCop can also employ a a jetpack to fly around the levels.<br><br>Aside from enemies there are also other hazards such as falling bombs, electricity and rolling barrels. <br><br>In between normal levels the player can expect boss fights and a sliding puzzle with mugshots.\n",
