  "description": "<em>Harvest Moon</em> is a farming simulation where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. <br><br>You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.<br><br>The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.<br><br>From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.<br><br>The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.
