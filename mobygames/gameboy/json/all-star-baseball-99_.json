  "description": "<i>All-Star Baseball 99</i> is the first handheld entry in the <i>All-Star Baseball</i> series and differs from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/all-star-baseball-99\">N64 counterpart</a>. It is instead closely based on the handheld version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/frank-thomas-big-hurt-baseball_\">Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball</a>.<br><br>The game features six different modes: exhibition games, a full season (either all 162 games of the 1998 season or various shortened runs), the '97 playoffs, the '97 All-Star game as well as the Home Run Derby, and a batting practice mode. In season and playoff mode, progress is saved via passwords.<br><br>On the field, players will control pitching, fielding and batting (bunts and swings are possible). The game also allows players to set team lineups and positions.<br><br>The game includes all 30 MLB teams of the 1998 season, including the '98 expansion teams Arizona and Tampa Bay.",
