The games included are:<ul><li>Parachute: Catch the falling characters to gain points.</li><br>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-watch-helmet\">Helmet</a>: Run around the arena while trying to avoid falling objects.</li><br>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-watch-chef\">Chef</a>: Catch falling pieces of food and cook them to feed to customers.</li><br>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Game+%26+Watch%3a+Vermin\">Vermin</a>: Move around the arena and whack the characters to climb out of the holes in the ground.</li><br>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Donkey+Kong\">Donkey Kong</a>: The original <i>Donkey Kong</i> game, where as Mario the player must stop Donkey Kong and save the Princess by collecting keys and dodging falling obstacles thrown by Donkey Kong.</li></ul><br><br>The player's high score is tracked on each game variant—classic and modern, with an easy mode and hard mode variant of each—and for every 200 points they score in a game's variant, they are awarded one star, up to five for each game variant.  The more stars a player has, the more additional features they unlock, including a sound test, additional Game &amp; Watch games (in classic form only), and a sixth modernized game:<br><br><li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Game+%26+Watch%3a+Ball\">Ball</a>: Juggle a collection of objects.  Unlike the other games in the collection, dropping one instantly ends the game.</li><br>",
