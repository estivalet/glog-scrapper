  "description": "<i>Tobu Tobu Girl</i> is a platform game released for the classic Game Boy as a free downloadable ROM from itch.io and as a limited edition complete in box (Japanese-styled version) with the game on cartridge.<br><br><p>The main goal of the game is to save your cat who's floating softly into the sky on a balloon. To reach your pet kitten, you must jump and bounce of enemies to reach for the sky. One can dash to the side, with a maximum of three before regeneration is needed, to manoeuvre around obstacles. Flapping your arms is another way to reach upwards, costing energy as you boost yourself upwards. Dashing down into enemies below will also propel you upwards and regain your &quot;flapping boost energy&quot;.",
