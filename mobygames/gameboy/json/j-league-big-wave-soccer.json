  "description": "<i>J League: Big Wave Soccer</i> is a soccer game featuring the Japanese soccer league with its 14 teams, including the speciality of a penalty shootout in case of a draw result. The player directly controls the athletes on the field; either the one in ball possession or, if the opponent has it, the one nearest.  There is the possibility to participate in the league, a training match or an all-star match where the athletes of the different teams can be switched around. The screen shows a relatively small part of the field and scrolls in all directions.",
