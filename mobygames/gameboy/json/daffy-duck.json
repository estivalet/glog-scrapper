  "description": "Daffy Duck dons the futuristic outfit of Duck Dodgers, hero of the 24½th century, to battle his nemesis Marvin the Martian in this platform game.<br><br>Four levels of alien landscapes and high-tech bases full of strange enemies await Daffy. He is equipped with a ray gun and a jetpack. The jetpack allows him to reach great heights, but burns fuel rapidly - firing it only in short bursts is advised to cross larger gaps; it recharges when landing on solid ground. Enemies can be dispatched by jumping on top of them or firing the ray gun at them, even though it fires in a rather ridiculous arc. Killing opponents gives points, which can be spent to change the standard gun to more advanced models featuring rapid fire, laser blasts, bouncing bullets, and more. Lost health points can be recharged by finding heart icons or by spending points.<br><br>In some parts of the game, Daffy steps on a flying sled and must evade Marvin, always close on his tail.\nThe game also features several boss battles against Marvin, his dog K-9 and other spacey creatures.",
