  "description": "This is a puzzle game featuring several <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Peanuts+licensees\">Peanuts</a> characters.  You play as the beagle magician Snoopy The Great whose bird friend, Woodstock, has been replicated by a dangerous Magic Ball Trick that goes out of control.  Snoopy must rescue all the duplicate Woodstocks in each room within a time limit while avoiding the bouncing balls.  <br><br>Each room is an 8x9 grid which also contain blocks which can be pushed, one way arrows, warp zones and power-ups.  There are 120 different rooms and passwords are used to start at levels you have beaten already.   After level 60 to make things more difficult, Spike, Snoopy's brother will follow and try to catch him as well.  The multiplayer is a vs mode where the second player plays Spike and attempts to catch Snoopy before he completes each room.  ",
