You travel through various levels, defeating enemies, to gain yourself enough to eat in this side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the <moby game=\"Prehistorik Man\">other game<moby>, the levels and controls differ in this version, due to the limitations of the Game Boy. There are ten levels and after every second level, there is a boss fight. Also, there are only two buttons, jump and attack.",
