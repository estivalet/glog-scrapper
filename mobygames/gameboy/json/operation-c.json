  "description": "<em>Operation C</em> is a Game Boy sequel to the popular NES titles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/contra_\">Contra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/super-contra\">Super C</a> and is, essentially, a side-scrolling shooter. You play a Rambo-esque character that goes around shooting everything in sight, collecting weapon upgrades and bonuses.<br><br>The game introduces the character of Black Viper to the series' oft-jumbled continuity.  Black Viper would later return in the Nintendo DS title, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/contra-4\">Contra 4</a>, as the primary villain.  <br><br>The game features only five levels, two of which are played from an overhead perspective similar to <i>Super C</i>.  <i>Operation C</i> is also notable in featuring the upgradable Spread Gun (from three to five shots) and introducing the Hunter Gun.  <br><br>There is also the occasional platform element such as jumping puzzles, moving platforms etc., and the mandatory end-level boss.\n",
