  "description": "<i>NavyBlue '90</i>, just like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Battleship%3a+The+Classic+Naval+Game\">predecessor</a>, uses the classic <i>Battleship</i> playing principle: two players place ships on a 8x8 grid and then, in turns, guess a position on the opponent's grid. The goal is to hit all ship parts first. There are a few extra weapons available which allow to scout enemy grids or hit multiple grids at once.<br><br>The main difference to the predecessor is that players have to choose their equipment before the match starts: three ships (out of seven) and which/how many extra weapons. \nThere is also a time limit in place which restricts the time to choose the next move.",
