Milon must recover the stolen instruments and rescue the queen from the wizard.  Armed only with a magical bubble-shooting ability, Milon makes his way through the rooms of the castle finding items and money that can help him progress.  This is a platformer that blends Mario-esqe action with puzzle-solving and exploration.",
