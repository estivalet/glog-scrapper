  "description": "<i>Super Momotar? Dentetsu ?</i> is a financial board game featuring Hudson Soft's interpretation of the folklore hero Momotar?. It is the second game in the series to feature the Super moniker, given to the 16-bit iterations of the series (even if this version also was ported to the Game Boy).<br><br>Each player plays a real estate corporation with the aim to earn as much money from property as possible while avoiding visiting other players property. The game can be played with 1-4 players (5 in the PC Engine version) with computers filling any missing spots, in a turn-based fashion. Each player starts a turn by either rolling a dice or using a card picked up during the game.",
