  "description": "Zitz, Rash and Pimple are three toads with unique fighting abilities (much like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). While partying on the Lost Vega leisure space station, the three get distracted by a dancer, who reveals herself as the Dark Queen. All of a sudden, Rash and Pimple are kidnapped and as Zitz, you must chase after the Dark Queen while evading the many enemies blocking your inter-galactic path.<br><br>You control Zitz, the Battletoad. In some levels, you must walk along, beating up any enemies that you encounter. In other levels, you are flying or racing along, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the end of each level, there is a boss battle. While it shares the same name and main characters as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/battletoads\">other versions</a>, the levels and most enemies in this version differ greatly.",
