  "description": "<i>Jeopardy!</i> is a conversion of the TV quiz show, the first of several versions released for the Game Boy. It features an accurate representation of the game's rules and a reservoir of more than 1500 answers and questions in around 300 categories.<br><br>The game is for one or two players (either on one Game Boy or via link cable). After the players enter their names, they are assigned a random character drawn in a cartoon style. Gameplay follows the show's rules: one player selects the category and difficulty and both can then buzz in within ten seconds to attempt to ask the right question for the answer given. The solution must be spelled out via cursor input within 60 seconds. If the solution is incorrect, the other player has the chance to try. Daily Double fields (for wagering any amount of money) are also present, as are the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds. The answer categories include history, geography, arts, sciences, politics, pop culture, and more, most with a heavy US focus.",
