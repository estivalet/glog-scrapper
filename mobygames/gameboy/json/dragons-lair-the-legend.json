  "description": "The Game Boy version for <i>Dragon's Lair</i> is actually a port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/roller-coaster\">Roller Coaster</a>, with its protagonist replaced by Dirk the Daring. Dirk must collect all &quot;lifestones&quot; scattered all around the game world (by walking or jumping) to finally save Princess Daphne. The game world is divided in several screens which can be freely navigated and are a little wider than Game Boy's screen. As Dirk moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic hats and other kinds of moving platforms.<br><br>Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms, touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat reminiscent from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=NES\">NES version</a>. The game can be played in two different speeds and can also be played by two players taking turns.",
