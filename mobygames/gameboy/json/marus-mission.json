  "description": "One day while Maru and Cori are taking a walk in Central Park, a strange thing happens. Out of nowhere this weird looking guy shows up and waylays the unsuspecting couple. Before Maru can respond, the weird looking guy and Cori vanish without a trace, leaving Maru behind wondering what in the world just happened.<br><br><i>Maru's Mission</i> is a side scrolling action game. Traveling throughout the world from such locations as the USA and Romania, you fight mythological monsters such as Isis and Dracula. <br><br>Maru can shoot sparks in rapid succession and can also get access to a variety of powerful different weapons. Maru can collect hearts to replenish his health and jump to avoid obstacles or dodge enemies. Levels are usually finished by defeating a level boss which sometimes earns a new weapon.",
