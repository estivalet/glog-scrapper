  "description": "<i>Mikeneko Holmes no Kishid?</i> is an adventure game based on the 7th Mikeneko Holmes novel by Jir? Akagawa, originally published in 1983. It is a murder mystery taking place in a palace in Germany. The game's namesake is Holmes, a calico cat who helps assist the siblings Yoshitar? and Harumi Katayama in their detective work. The player chooses from a list of commands, such as &quot;Look&quot; (while using the game cursor to point at objects), &quot;Talk&quot; and &quot;Go&quot;, with other verbs appearing in the appropriate contexts. The player can also switch between Yoshitar? and Harumi, or generate a password to resume playing later. There is also a &quot;game description&quot; option on the main menu which explains the game's premise and controls to new players.",
