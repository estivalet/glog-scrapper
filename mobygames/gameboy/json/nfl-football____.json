  "description": "<i>NFL Football</i> is a football game based on the American NFL. The player can only participate in exhibition matches and has the choice between 28 teams which differ slightly in speed. Before a play, the player has the option between several tactical approaches (six in offense, seven in defense) and then the player directly controls the active athlete who is marked with an arrow. After a ball throw the control switches to the receiving athlete and the player has to catch it. Punts and kickoffs are automated.",
