  "description": "Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,25947/\">Harrison Ford</a>. Pac-Man can even transform himself into a swimmer, rock eater, fireball spitter or rope swinger during his quest.<br><br>The game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village and the Castle. When you manage to get through them, the last one awaits: The Machine which seems to be some sort of a way to get out of here. This level is not a typical stage after stage approach. Each screen has several exist that can either bring you closer to or further from the end of the game.<br><br><i>Pac-in-Time</i> is a reskinning of <i>Fury of the Furries</i>. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man. In <i>Fury of the Furries</i>, you control a cute, round creature called Tiny, who must defeat &quot;the wicked one&quot; who has captured the King, and turned all the Tinies into mindless monsters.  <br><br>A game with the same <i>Pac-in-Time</i> title came out for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/pac-in-time__\">SNES</a> but it is a different game.<br><br>",
