  "description": "<i>Magnetic Soccer</i> is based on table football (and not magnetic football as the name implies): each team has eight athletes which are divided into four rows (1-2-3-2). Those rows can be moved left and right (in contrast to the real game, all rows are moved at once) and turned in order to kick the ball. Players also can stop the ball and perform powerful shots which incapacitate enemy athletes (except the goalkeeper) when hit. The goal is to score more goals than the opponent; a draw results in a penalty shootout.<br><br>The game features various playing options including three different surfaces, multiplayer, a training mode without an enemy team, a spectator mode for AI matches and three difficulty levels.",
