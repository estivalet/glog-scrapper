  "description": "<i>Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i> is essentially the same game as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Disney%27s%3a+The+Hunchback+of+Notre+Dame+5+Topsy+Turvy+Games\">PC version</a>, but features two new mini games (&quot;Catch the Fool&quot; and &quot;Picture Puzzle&quot;). In turn, the mini games &quot;Le Food Fight&quot; and &quot;Inside Outwords&quot; were removed. <br><br>The game is a mini games collection based on the Disney movie of the same name. The mini games are:\n<ul><li>Chiseler: A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a> variant</li></li>\n<li>Djali Bowling: A bowling variant with a &quot;two-click&quot; system: the position of the bowling goat and the speed by clicking the button with the correct timing while the goat respectively an arrow automatically move back and forth - the position when the button is pressed determines the result. The player also has to choose if the throw is straight or with a drift.</li>\n<li>Catch the Fool: The player is in charge of a rescue net and can move left and right. People are thrown out of the window and the player has to move into position in order to rescue them.</li>\n<li>Upsy Daisy: Two participants are floating because they have a bundle of balloons in their hands. The goal is to destroy all of the opponent's balloons.</li>\n<li>Picture Puzzle: A standard sliding block puzzle.</li>\n<li>Wheel of Fortune: This game has to be unlocked with good results in the other mini games. The game randomly chooses one of the games and assigns a certain mission to it, e.g. beating a certain level in Chiseler with only one ball.</li></ul>",
