  "description": "<i>Nakajima Satoru Kansh? F-1 Hero GB</i> is one of the various formula one games endorsed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,415182/\">Satoru Nakajima</a> and published by Varie. It is loosely based on the 1991 Formula One season.<br><br>The gameplay is very similar to the Game Boy's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=F-1+Race\">F-1 Race</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Michael+Andrettis+World+GP\">Nakajima Satoru F-1 Hero</a>, however the degree of difficulty is higher. The track map is not displayed on the screen, which means the player has to basically memorize each turn in order to not get off the track or collide with the advertising signs.<br><br>In the first play-through, the grand prix mode has sixteen rounds divided into eight different levels. In each of these levels there's a main rival to beat. A password will be displayed when the player finish successfully each level, while the game over screen appears if the number of points obtained is lower than those obtained by the rival. In the first play-through all these rivals (except the first one) will not compete since the very beginning of the championship. One example is Satoru Nakajima which will only appear in the last round.<br><br>However if the player use a specific level password, the championship will start all over again with all the competitors and difficulty (in terms of the qualifying time) of that level. Briefly, to play a real competitive championship, the player will have to finish Round 15 first to access the last password.<br><br>Before every race, there's the setting option where the player can customize the machine by adjusting six parts: tires, wings, brake, mission, suspension, and steer. While racing, four parts can be damaged. &quot;Pit in&quot; will fix these &quot;trouble parts&quot;.<br><br>To enter the race and compete against five other drivers, a minimum time in the qualifying session (which consists of two laps) must be obtained. At certain point during the first play-through, with advancing levels, the difficulty will increase, meaning that the player has to make an almost &quot;immaculate&quot; lap in order to obtain a good time and therefore be qualified.<br><br>Other modes presented in the game include: warming up, multi game, and music test.",
