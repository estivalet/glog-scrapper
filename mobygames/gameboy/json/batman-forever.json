  "description": "<i>Batman Forever</i> is the officially licensed game based on the 1995 movie. The bad guys this time around are the Riddler and Two-Face.<br><br>This game is a hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The player makes their way through levels that include some platform jumping elements, but take on opponents one at a time like in a fighting game. The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets (one has to be chosen before the level starts) and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special button combinations. In contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/batman-forever_\">console/DOS version</a>, there are no puzzles to solve.",
