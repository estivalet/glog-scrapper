  "description": "<i>Swamp Thing</i> is a platform game based on the DC Comics character. Released in conjunction with an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/swamp-thing\">NES game of the same name</a>, the Game Boy version has a unique design and set of levels.<br><br>Players control Swamp Thing who must move out into the world to combat Dr. Arcane. Arcane plans to release a serum into the atmosphere that will turn everyone into mutated beings called Un-Men. Besides stopping Arcane, Swamp Thing also has to heal the environmental damage the villain and his henchmen have created.<br><br>The game consists of four levels: at the start of the game, players can choose whether to start in the desert, arctic or forest, all of which have to be completed (in any order) before the final level opens up. In each level, players will confront various wild animals under Arcane's control and can defeat them with a shot attack. Firing a shot actually reduces Swamp Thing's life energy - it is a good idea to catch the shot when it boomerangs back to regain it. Collecting water icons also restores life energy. Besides energy there is also a second meter that slowly drains automatically - it represents the environmental health and can be refilled by helping friendly animals (like turning an upended turtle back up) or recycling trash lying about the levels with a special recycling attack.<br><br>At the end of each level, a powerful boss enemy awaits. Defeating the boss results in Swamp Thing gaining a new power, like invisibility. The powers only work when he stands still, however.",
