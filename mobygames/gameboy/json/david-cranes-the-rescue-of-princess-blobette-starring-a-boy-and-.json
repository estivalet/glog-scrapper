Your goal, of course, is to rescue the Princess Blobette from a large castle.  In order to do so, the Boy must use the Blob to get past the castle's many obstacles.  The Blob is an extremely useful creature. By feeding it jelly beans, it will turn into useful things like a trampoline, ladder, or key.",
