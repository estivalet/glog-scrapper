  "description": "<i>ICBM Attack</i> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/missile-command_\">Missile Command</a>. Like in the arcade game the player's task is to protect a number of cities on the ground but here the attack does not come from missiles. Instead there are enemy ships that enter the screen one at a time and drop bombs on the cities. The player has access to three outposts on the ground that are fired individually and are used to shoot down the ships as well as their bombs. Each outpost has limited ammo and when it has run out no further shooting can be done from it. Points are scored for hitting bombs and ships and for completing levels and at 10,000 points an extra city is given. The game ends when all cities have been destroyed.",
