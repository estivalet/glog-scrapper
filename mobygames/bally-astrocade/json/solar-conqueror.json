  "description": "<i>Solar Conqueror</i> is a top-down viewed shoot 'em up with multidirectional shooting and movement similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/robotron\">Robotron</a>. The war hungry DEMENS are threatening to wipe out the player's race with a radiation death ray and therefore the player has to conquer their solar systems.<br><br>Each solar system consists of two or four planets and to conquer them all planets have to be defeated. In each screen a planet is located to the far right of the screen and from it various alien defenders will appear. To defeat the planet and move on to the next one the player has to kill all the enemies while avoiding getting hit by them. There are three different enemies: kamikaze combat ships, ground-to-air missiles and super fighting (killer) satellites. There are also asteroids floating around the planets that has to be avoided. Larger planets have stronger gravity which leads to the spaceship being harder control. The effect of the gravity increases as the ship gets closer to the planet.<br><br>The game can be played by up to four players. Before starting out it's possible to choose how many lives each player should have and at what levels they should start on, thereby handicapping more skilled players. Any contact with an enemy, a projectile or a planet leads to a lost life but a new one is given for each solar system conquered.",
