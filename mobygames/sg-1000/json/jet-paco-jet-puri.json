  "description": "<i>Jet Paco &amp; Jet Puri</i> is a homebrew 2D platform game that is a reworked and an expanded version of the 2015 homebrew NES game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jet-paco\">Jet-Paco</a> by the same developer. The game is largely identical to the NES version, but this is the first release of the game for the SG-1000 platform. A major difference is the addition of a third mission called Mission C available on the title screen.<br><br>Also new is that the player can now choose a new character, Jet Puri, in addition to Jet Paco as the original protagonist. The character selection is also done on the title screen. The character Jet Puri was previously introduced through a game in the 2017 NES release <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mojon-twins-gran-sabidura-31-in-1-real-games\">Mojon Twins Gran Sabiduría: 31 in 1 Real Games</a>, but unlike that game she wears clothes in this release. The characters are described as siblings: Paco and Puri Rebollez.",
