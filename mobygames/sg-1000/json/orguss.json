  "description": "<i>Orguss</i> is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the anime series of the same name. The inhabitants of Terram has constructed a terrifying weapon that can destroy space-time. The player character, piloting the Orguss craft, has 2:30 minutes to get to the weapon and deactivate it. This is done by flying either in the native ship form, or transforming into the powerful mecha Orgroid. The mecha shoots repeatedly if the player presses the fire button, while the ship's gun has to be fire separately for each shot. However, when the protagonist is in mecha form the screen scrolls slower, preventing the player from getting to the weapon in time. Enemies include hostile craft and stationary turrets on the ground. There are no power-ups of any kind, and the only stage of the game repeats itself after completion with increased difficulty.",
