  "shortName": "safari-race",
  "description": "A racing game with safari backgrounds and the added challenging of avoiding wild animals crossing the track. You must reach each checkpoint in the time allowed. You also risk running out of fuel and can refuel at petrol pumps(at the expense of your precious time of course). The background music seems to be derived from Henry Mancini's &quot;Baby Elephant Walk&quot;(1961).",
