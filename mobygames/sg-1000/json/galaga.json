  "description": "<i>Galaga</i> is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!<br><br>There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a &quot;challenge stage&quot; in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.<br><br>Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last &quot;life,&quot; you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.<br><br>A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final &quot;hit ratio&quot;--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.",
