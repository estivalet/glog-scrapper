  "description": "In <i>Guzzler</i>, you play a small transparent character trapped in a maze filled with walking flames, born from stationary fires. In order to survive, you must extinguish flames — and their mother fires — by filling up with water from a few puddles spread out around the screen (similar to the power pills of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a></i>) and spit it out on the fires. However, once you are filled to the top, you move slower, making you a prone victim of the fires. One refill from a puddle is good enough for three cascades of water, making you lighter — and faster — each time you spit, but the range of your deluge will also be shorter. From time to time, an alcoholic beverage appears in the middle of the screen, the fires will momentarily freeze while you are fully recharged and may put them out at leisure.",
