You assemble a party of brave adventurers and venture into the tower, defeating monsters on your way to the great treasure.<br><br><i>The Black Onyx</i> is one of the first traditional role-playing games made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Wizardry+series\">Wizardry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Ultima+series\">Ultima</a> games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. The player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party. The combat engine is turn-based.",
