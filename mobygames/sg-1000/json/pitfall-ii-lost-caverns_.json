  "description": "<i>Pitfall II: Lost Caverns</i> features gameplay similar to the same titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/pitfall-ii-lost-caverns\">Pitfall II: Lost Caverns</a>, but features some differences.<br><br>This version of the game has a redesigned level layout, breaking the game up into four distinct sections. For instance some gameplay screens from the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/pitfall\">Pitfall!</a> make an appearance. Other differences include the fact that getting hit by enemies now cost the player lives instead of as in the other version where it would just cause a loss of score. mine carts that can be ridden in, and the addition of a final boss.<br><br>In the Arcade version specifically the player starts with a 3 minute countdown till their game ends. Lost time can be regained by collecting treasures.",
