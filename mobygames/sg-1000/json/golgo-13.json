  "description": "<i>Golgo 13</i> is a scrolling shooter based on the manga of the same name, putting the player in control of its main character, the assassin Duke Togo. In this adaptation, however, the protagonist's goal is, on the contrary, to rescue people. The screen scrolls horizontally, displaying Duke on a car that is moving along the road, trying to keep up with a moving train on top of the screen. The player can move the car left and right, aligning it with the train's cars.<br><br>The goal is to shoot the train's windows, letting the people trapped inside run out. The player controls a crosshair, moving it in all directions, and presses the fire button to shoot. Between the player-controlled character and the train there is another track with a never-ending cargo train on it; tall cars of this train will not only block the crosshair's path, but also bounce the bullets back at Duke, hurting him. In later stages trucks will appear on the road and helicopters will shoot missiles at Duke. ",
