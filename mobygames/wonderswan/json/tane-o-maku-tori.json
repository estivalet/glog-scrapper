  "description": "The raven has made a friend. But sorrow be to this raven, for this fellow avian migrates, and will not return for seasons. Filled with sadness and regret the raven takes wing. As he soars through his lonely world his tears begin to fall... and water dying flowers. At last he knows what he must do until his friend returns, he will make new friends in the flowers. He will help them grow and spread their seeds. <br><br>Each level in <i>Tane o Maku Tori</i> contains four pillars bridged by a series of horizontal or vertical rows. These rows are different for each of the three spaces formed by the pillar. The rows may be moved up and down, one set at a time. At the foot of a column, up to three in harder areas, will be a nascent flower. Water drops will fall along the path of the pillars, which will have a different theme for each level, and eventually either fall onto the ground or a flower. Water drops will always move along a bridge if it intersects their path, drops can't go up diagonals. Drops an combine to create larger faster moving drops. Any more than three drops and it will simply fall off the pillar, or bridge, and be of no use.<br><br>When a flower gets enough rain drops, or tear drops, it will bloom, when all the flowers on the stage bloom it will be cleared. <br><br>Enemies also roam the stage, gobbling up hydrogen based solution and plants. They follow the same laws as the drops and will move along beams when encountered, however they can go up vertical beams. Should one reach a flower it will nibble at it until dead. This ends the game; however, enemies can be destroyed by three drops combined. <br><br>A time mode is available where the player picks a difficulty level and then plays on the level until a flower is eaten or they run out of time, each completed flower will add to the time. <br><br>A two player mode is available through the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Communication+Cable\">Communication Cable</a><br><br>This game is played vertically.",
