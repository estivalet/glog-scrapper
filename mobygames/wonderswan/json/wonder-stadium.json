  "description": "<i>Wonder Stadium</i>, not to be confused with the nearly identical <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wonder-stadium-99\">Wonder Stadium '99</a>, presents a monochrome baseball experience for the WonderSwan. Players will quickly be able to start playing as one of fourteen teams, twelve professional two fictional, in All-Star Duel, Exhibition Game, or Homerun Competition modes. Players can also personalize their teams by giving the generic characters who comprise the teams names. <br><br>When starting a game you'll be asked to select a team, a stadium; classic, seaside, or space, and how many innings the game will run from 1 to 9.<br><br>Hitting the ball is the 'simple' affair that it usually is, time your swing and if you timed well your ball will fly into or out of the field. <i>Wonder Stadium</i> does give the ability to bunt and tweak the direction that bunt will go. <br><br>While playing the field you'll have considerable command over a number of different pitches. From moving your pitchers subtly around the mound to how hard a throw you'll give. Once your opposing team manages to get a hit the game stops giving you the view from behind the plate and switches to a birds-eye view of the field.<br><br>Each ballplayer is hooked to another for instance when you move your man on first base the fellow in the field behind him will move in the same way, a bit clumsy but an acceptable compromise. The person nearest to the ball will always be under your control. Once you get the ball you may throw it toward a base of your choice.",
