  "description": "The first North American release of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Fire+Pro+Wrestling+series\">Fire Pro Wrestling series</a> comes to the Game Boy Advance.<br><br><i>Fire Pro Wrestling</i> has a stacked roster, comprised of many not-quite-copyright-infringing wrestlers like &quot;The Bionic Man&quot; Steve Majors (&quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin) and Axe Duggan (Hulk Hogan), making WCW vs. WWF vs. ECW matches possible.  The controls are much more than the typical &quot;mash buttons until something happens&quot; that were so popular in earlier wrestling games, instead relying on timing to properly execute a move or hold.",
