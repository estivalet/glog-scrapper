  "description": "Arthur the brave knight must rescue his beloved Princess Prin-Prin from the Demon Emperor Azazel and his forces. Among them are various undead (ghosts, zombies), bats, ogres and goblins. Other challenges include moving platforms, ladders and water/fire hazards. This game combines enemies from all three previous <i>Ghosts 'N Goblins</i> games.<br><br>Arthur can walk left and right, jump, and he is equipped with a lance to use as a weapon. Getting hit by enemies causes Arthur to lose his armor and run around in his underpants. Getting hit again will cause the player to lose a life. As in most games in this genre, Arthur can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, proving greater firepower.",
