  "description": "This is the second game in Digimon Adventure series, a kind of an add-on to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Anode+Tamer\"> Anode Tamer</a>. The game is based on the popular manga <i>Digimon</i>. The hero, a boy named Ryou, has to travel to digital world in order to free his friends from the clutches of the evil digital monster Milenniamon.<br><br>The story of this game is identical to that of &quot;Anode Tamer&quot;, and gameplay mechanics are exactly the same: you descend into dungeons to fight monsters in turn-based style, capture the monsters after the battles and then send them to fight new ones. The difference between the two games are the monsters themselves: &quot;Cathode Tamers&quot; features a brand new set of monsters, and since the beginning of the game you encounter different foes. The full collection of monsters can be achieved only if you complete both games.",
