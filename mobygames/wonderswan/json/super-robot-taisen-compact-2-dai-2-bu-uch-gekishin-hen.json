  "description": "The second part of the <i>Super Robot Wars/Taisen Compact 2</i>. This time the story plays out in space, specifically around Earth and the Solar System. At the same time the conflict begins on Earth, troubles begin around the Earth orbit as well. This time, the game follows the story of Excellen Browning, a pilot of the real robot &quot;Weiss Ritter&quot;, specializing in sniping enemies from afar.<br><br>Like the previous game, when players complete the game, they can make a &quot;game cleared&quot; save file on WonderSwan's internal memory. Said file can be transfered over to the final game for added bonuses. Transferring over the save file from the previous game gives players bonuses for the rest of the game. However, starting the game without transferring anything is entirely possible.",
