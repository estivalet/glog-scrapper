  "description": "In <i>Anchorz Field</i> you need to anchor off territory using harpoon firing tanks, in a similar style to how you would in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/qix\">QIX</a> and battle against other bobble headed armies to take over an archipelago of islands. It contains a variety of maps with different terrain, such as mountains, which restrict movement. Combat is turn based, and the harpooning of territory works off vectors not restricted to cardinal directions. Before and during battle there are illustrated cutscenes with text explaining the story.",
