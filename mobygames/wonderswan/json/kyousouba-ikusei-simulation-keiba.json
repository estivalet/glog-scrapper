The majority of the gameplay focuses on micromanaging your horses training and care. You an select the races that you think you're horse is ready for in an attempt to win coveted ribbons, and wealth beyond the dreams of avarice!<br><br>Once you enter a race you'll be taken out of control and see if all you're hard work has payed off as your beast makes it around the track. An announcer follows the competition of there Muybridge wannabes, narrating what you see.<br><br>Regardless how good your horse is it will be economically prudent to continue its line. Through shrewd husbandry you can translate the positive traits of race horse to a new generation. You'll be able to select a proper mate from other stables. <br><br>Horse information and stable data can be shared with other players via the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Communication+Cable\">Communication Cable</a>.",
