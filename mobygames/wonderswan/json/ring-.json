In the game you'll have the unfortunate experience of running across a VHS tape the contents of which will mysteriously kill the viewer seven days after viewing. The tape has been making the rounds at a local high school and students are starting to get used to seeing the petrified faces of their lifeless peers staring blankly up at them from all manner of unlikely places. <br><br>After you find watch the video you decide not to be like the rest of those putzes that went down without a fight. You're going to find out the secret of the video and cheat death. With the help of your classmates and your clandestine crush you might just make it out of this viewing alive. Should you fail, however, you will most certainly fall prey to the videos ghastly creator...<br><br><i>Ring ?</i> is a text based 'choose your own adventure' game. You'll be presented with text to read and occasionally get a chance to make a decision. Occasionally you'll have to make a decision very quickly, e.g. you've just thrown a stone at someones window but accidental broken it, you'll be given your list of action and timed to pick one.",
