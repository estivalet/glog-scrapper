  "description": "<i>Armored Unit</i> is a WonderSwan exclusive sci-fi turn-based strategy game. Main gameplay modes are story mode, trial mode, and duel mode. In the story mode the player starts by selecting an armored unit out of several available which vary in type (i.e. knight, ranger, seeker), weapons, and basic stats such as health and energy, after which one progresses through a series of stages backed up by a short dialogue cut-scenes between the stages.<br><br>The basic movement occurs on a square map field where you can move your armored unit horizontally or vertically. You fight an opponent which is a hidden armored unit, visible only when you are adjacent to it or if you have a radar that can uncover it within a certain radius. Armed with weapons and special attacks based on the type of unit you have selected your goal is to defeat the enemy unit and progress to the next stage. You can fight at random map fields or use weapons of mass destruction to try and hit enemy unit without knowing where exactly it is located. After each stage, you are able to upgrade and edit your current weapon arsenal, or add new weapons and gadgets.",
