  "description": "<i>Munch!</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> variant. As can be expected the player has to move the muncher through a maze and eat all the dots. At the same times monsters have to be avoided. Eating a power fill will cause the monsters to temporarily become sedated and the player can go after and eat them for bonus points. More bonus points can be earned by eating the fruit that occasionally appears in the middle of the maze. The player has three munchers and an additional one is awarded after 10000 points. When they have all been killed the game ends.",
