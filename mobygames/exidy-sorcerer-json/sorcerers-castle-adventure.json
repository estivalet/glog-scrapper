The player starts in an enchanted forest, where every location appears exactly the same, or are they the same location? The goal is to find the Sorcerer's Castle and save the princess, but finding the castle will be the first quest to embark on. <br><br>Sometimes a Jester will pop from seemingly nowhere to give the player a cryptic hint.<br><br>Some Commodore 64 versions feature saving and restoring.",
