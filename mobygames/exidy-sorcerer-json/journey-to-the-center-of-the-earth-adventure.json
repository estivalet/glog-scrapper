  "description": "<i>Journey to the Center of the Earth Adventure</i>  is a treasure hunt text adventure game loosely inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,61309/\">Jules Verne's</a> book of the same name. The player starts on a malfunctioning ship and must explore the innards of the earth in order to repair the space ship. Giant bugs are everywhere and must be avoided or the player will die.<br><br>Controls in the game are similar to other early text adventures with a limited vocabulary, players can move in compass directions and interact with some of the objects that are described verbally. Performing correct actions earns the player points to a maximum of 175 on completion of the game.",
