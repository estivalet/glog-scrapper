  "description": "<i>Magic Maze</i> is a maze game where the objective simply is to reach the maze's exit. This is made harder by pits which when stepped over transports the player to a random location in the maze. Pits are shown before starting but becomes invisible during the game. The size of the maze and the difficulty is set by the player who also gets to choose between two modes: L or M. In the L mode the entire maze is visible (except the pits) while in the M mode it's necessary to memorize the maze since walls only become visible when they are bumped into. The game is played with keyboard by typing in directions (U, D, L, R).",
