  "description": "<i>NBA Basketball</i> is an early, very basic basketball game.  While officially licensed by the NBA, the game contains no team names or players to speak of.  There are only two teams, a Home team and a Visitor team.  The Home team is red and the Visitor team is green.  <br><br>The game is shown from a side-court angle with team baskets on the left and right sides of the screen.  Characters animate when running, and when dribbling the basketball.  The &quot;floor&quot; does have basic basketball set-up including the center line and free throw lines.  <br><br>NBA Basketball is a two-player (only) game and features four quarters, passing, blocking and jump shots.  There is even overtime should it become necessary.<br><br>The title screen says only &quot;Basketball,&quot; but the box and game cartridge have the NBA emblem and &quot;NBA Basketball&quot; printed on them.",
