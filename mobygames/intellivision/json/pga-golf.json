  "description": "<i>PGA Golf</i> is a golf game played from an overhead point of view. Up to four players can compete on a nine hole, par 38 course containing a variety of terrain (greens, fairway, rough, water, and sand) as well as numerous trees. Each player has nine clubs (3 woods, 4 irons, a wedge, and a putter) and is able hook, slice, and control the power of each shot. You will receive penalty strokes for balls that land out of bounds and in the water, and of course the lowest score at the end of the round wins!",
