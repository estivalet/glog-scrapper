  "description": "In <i>White Water!</i> your goal is to raft down a river in the shortest time possible. The river features many dangerous turns, rocks, whirlpools, barrels, and other obstacles that get in your way. You begin your trip with three men, and if you don't navigate carefully they can fall out of the raft! If any men remain in the raft, they can try pick up anyone who has fallen out but must do so before they hit a rock, a whirlpool, or leave the screen (if all of your men fall out of the raft, the game will end). In the easier game variations, your score is based on how quickly you can reach the finish line. In the more difficult game variations, you not only need to reach the finish line as quickly as possible but also need to earn points by landing your raft at various beaches along the way and collecting treasures that can be found in the forest. Some of the treasures will be guarded by the natives, so be careful (also be sure not to wander too far into the forest, or you'll become lost). The game ends when you reach the finish line, or all your men are lost either by falling in the river or in the forest. ",
