  "description": "Three games in one! <i>Triple Action</i> features three uniquely different arcade games:<ul>\n<li><i>Racing Cars</i> - Race side-by-side down the highway against an opponent, dodging standard traffic as you go. First one to 100 miles wins!</li><br><br><li><i>Battle Tanks</i> - Get in a tank and fight another player, hiding behind cover as you go. Choose between long-range or short-range bullets, or the ability for the bullets to bounce off objects for a true strategic challenge.</li><br><br><li><i>Biplanes</i> - Get into the cockpit of a biplane, fighting another player with either short or long range bullets. Hit the balloon for an extra point, but don't stall! First to 15 wins.</li></ul>\nEach game is specifically designed for two-players, resulting in a unique party game.",
