  "description": "<i>Super Pro Hockey</i> is a one or two-player hockey game. There are four handicap/skill levels to choose from after selecting whether or not the player wants a one or two-player game: Amateur, Rookie, Pro, Super Pro.  Essentially, changing the handicap results in changing speeds to the gameplay, from low (Amateur) to high (Super Pro).  There are no teams, only Home and Visitor.  <br><br>Each team has three players and a goalie. The home team is tan and the visitor team is green. The player can only control one character at at time, and this character is colored lighter than the rest of the player's team. Goalies are controlled by the computer.<br><br>The game also features a special slap shot button, a penalty box, face-offs, interceptions, and tripping.  <br><br>Tripping is considered a &quot;legal&quot; move if applied to the opponent character with the puck.  Penalties occur when a player trips an opponent character without a puck, and one player will be removed to the penalty box. The team with the penalized player must now defend for a short time with one less man.  Supposedly, the computer &quot;referee&quot; will only call a penalty about one in three times tripping occurs.<br><br>Various stats are maintained at the top of the screen, including score, penalty time, remaining time and which period the game is currently in. Periods are shown as bars on the screen rather than numbers--one for first, two for second, three for third.<br><br>The game has been criticized for essentially being little more than the original Intellivision <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/intellivision/nhl-hockey_\">NHL Hockey</a> game with an added single player mode.",
