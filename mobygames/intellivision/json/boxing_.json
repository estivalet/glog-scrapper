Victory is decided by the points, assigned by the computer (the referee), otherwise the match ends with a KO. Every round last 1 minute and 30 seconds.\nThe 2 players can choose their boxer (but not the same) from a rose of six men with different characteristics (speed, offensive power, endurance). The number six is unpredictable.",
