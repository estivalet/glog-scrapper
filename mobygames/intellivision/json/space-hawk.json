  "description": "<i>Space Hawk</i> is an arcade action game feature gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a>. You are an astronaut stuck in deep space. You are equipped with a jet pack to help move around, and a laser gun to destroy enemies. Your main enemy is a white space hawk which wanders around the screen, leaving a trail of deadly bubbles behind him. Try to score as many points as you can be destroying both the space hawk and the bubbles, both of which are constantly trying to get you. In case of emergencies,  you have the ability to enter hyperspace which will temporarily bring you away from danger. Hyperspace ability is limited, however, so be sure to conserve if you can!",
