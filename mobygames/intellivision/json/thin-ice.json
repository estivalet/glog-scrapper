  "description": "In this quirky arcade game, you play Duncan the penguin, who enjoys skating on thin ice--especially around the other penguins. The goal of this game is exactly that: to skate around the other penguins, dunking them into the frigid water while consuming tasty shrimp cocktails (to make him go faster). Duncan has to watch out for the evil seal and polar bear, who both like to bat Duncan about! If you can manage to sink all the penguins, you move onto the next level--where even more penguins await to be dunked.",
