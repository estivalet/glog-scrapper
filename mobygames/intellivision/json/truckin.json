  "description": "Get behind the wheel of a big rig and drive down the Interstate Highway system. Haul cargos to and from the cities of your choosing using your trusty road map. The player also has to watch out for Smokey or he will end up with a nifty speeding ticket. Deliver the cargo safely and it's on to the next job in <i>Truckin'</i>.<br><br>The screen is split in two halves, and a rear-mirror is featured. Players need to avoid incoming trucks and carefully plan the routes, even by consulting a real paper map to find the correct side roads. Some of the scenery included features Texas, Kansas and New York with distinct differences in the environment.",
