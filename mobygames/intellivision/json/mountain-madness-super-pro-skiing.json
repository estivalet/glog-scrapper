The game offers three different skiing styles for the player to use on 32 different courses.. The ski styles the player can choose between include skiing downhill, slalom, or skiing with no gates to worry about at all. Players can also select the number of slopes (between 1 to 15) they want on a given course. There is also an option for helicopter skiing where the game will randomly generate a course for the player to ski on. Players can also craft their own course from scratch.<br><br>At the end of a ski run, the player is given information on their run time, the number of gates they missed, and any penalty time they have incurred,",
