  "description": "<i>Malibu Bikini Volleyball</i> is a beach volleyball game where the goal is to be the first to score the game-winning points (10, 12 or 15 points) or out-score your opponent within the pre-set time limit (5, 10, 15 minutes or &quot;no limit&quot;). <br><br>There are two game types: friendly match (4 levels) and single-elimination tournament. The difficulty level can be adjusted by changing the game speed (9 settings) and the wind conditions. The coin toss before the start of the game determines which side will serve first. <br><br>Players can choose to play as either a male or female team. Up to 4 players can play together by connecting the consoles with Comlynx cables.<br><br>Also included is a &quot;CD Player&quot; feature that lets players pick a soundtrack while playing, complete with Repeat, Random or Program options.",
