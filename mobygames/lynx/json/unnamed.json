  "description": "<i>Unnamed</i> is a graphical adventure about a character that ends up in a location without remembering anything. Different rooms and gardens need to be explored to regain the lost memories. The game is presented through several fixed screens linked together with a bird's-eye perspective. The character can be controlled directly. The upper part of the screen is used to show the environment. The bottom third part is divided in two sections. On the left there are four commands to interact with the environment: Move, Look, Take and Use. The right section shows the inventory, text descriptions with observations and the result of interactions in the environment.<br><br>The game contains music and several hidden paths for certain sections of the game. There is EEPROM support to save a game in progress.",
