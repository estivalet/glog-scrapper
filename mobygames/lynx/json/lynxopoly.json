  "description": "This game is much like the famous Monopoly, but with a twist: you don't buy streets or railroad stations, now you buy Lynx games. Every player is a publisher that buys the rights to games. The players build add-ons and rent them to other publishers/players. The games are grouped in genres and every genre has its own colour.<br><br>There are three game modes: (1) Last Player: You win if you are the last player. (2) Turns 100: You win if you have the most money after 100 rounds. (3) First 100K: The first player who has $100.000 in his bag is the winner.",
