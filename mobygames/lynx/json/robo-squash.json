  "description": "Set in the 31st Century, this game begins when the President of the World has died at age 281 after being in power for 200 years. The United World Federation is in chaos. After nearly four centuries of the World Party being in control, the International Party is inclined to take over. Rumors regarding the President's death not being accidental are unconfirmed, but the World Party is still going on the defensive. Conventional warfare has been relegated to the obsolete and uncivilized past so the two parties are to settle the dispute the new, modern way, Robo-Squash.<br><br><i>Robo-Squash</i> is a game in which the player must catch as many balls in rows or columns as possible to win. An alternative way to win is to be the first player to hit the mechanical spider. As a round continues longer and longer, the balls will increase in speed, making the round progressively harder. Points can be collected by hitting bricks, special items, and the spider. When one of the players loses three balls or hits the mechanical spider, the round is over.<br><br>If the player wins, the World Party will remain in power. If the player loses the International Party will win and divide the world into separate countries surely resulting in the same petty fighting that almost destroyed civilization in the 21st Century.<br><br><i>Robo-Squash</i> is a two-player Comlynx enabled game.",
