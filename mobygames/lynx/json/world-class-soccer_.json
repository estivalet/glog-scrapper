  "description": "<i>World Class Soccer</i> brings football to the Lynx, allowing players to stage matches featuring more than 100 different national  teams. The game features selectable skill levels, adjustable game time (from 10 to 90 minutes), dry or muddy fields, and manual or automatic player switching.<br><br>During matches, the field is horizontally aligned, with the scrolling screen showing an angled view centered on the active player. When playing the goalie, the view zooms out for a better overview. On offense, the Lynx' two buttons allow players to make passes or kicks, on defense, tackles and sliding tackles, and for the goalie, high or low dives. On penalty shots, there is a choice of kicking high or low. The game supports two players via ComLynx connection.",
