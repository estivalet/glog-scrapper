  "description": "<i>Dr. Slump</i> is an action game based off the eponymous Japanese manga. It is exclusive to the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001 that was only available in Japan.<br><br>The player controls protagonist Arale-chan, as she attempts to prevent the alien King Nikochan and his servant from building a UFO out of car parts. By yelling at the two aliens, she can knock the aliens down and retrieve the stolen car parts. Arale-chan frequently runs out of Robovita-A fuel, however, and must recharge with a teapot that appears periodically.<br><br>Once the aliens have successfully carried five car parts to the launching pad at the top of the screen, they will finish building their UFO and will attempt to fly away. If Arale-chan can hit them with her &quot;N'cha Cannon&quot; yell, they will crash, and the player will receive many bonus points.<br><br>The game features two modes. In Level 1, the characters move slowly, while Level 2 features a faster speed. The player has three lives and must try to score as many points as possible. If the UFO successfully flies away, the player loses a life.",
