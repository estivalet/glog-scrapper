  "description": "<i>Blockhead 2</i> is a puzzle game that is visually similar to it's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/blockhead\">predecessor</a> but with a bit different gameplay. The game is still played from a top down perspective but is less based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> although there is still some pushing to do. The objective in each level is to collect a number of ingredients and put them in a magic mixing pot. The ingredients can be picked up and carried one by one to the pot but it is also possible to collect them by pushing or pulling the pot over the ingredients.<br><br>There are four different ingredients and each have different properties. There are green berries which do no harm, poisonous mushroom that decrease the player's energy points when carried, magic dust that accelerates the time when carried and the skulls of death that will kill the player if picked up by hand. The player can also lose lives by running out of energy or out of time. In addition to the ingredients the player will also come across traps and items. Items include axes that can clear out barricades, dynamite that can destroy walls and magic wands that can be used to teleport the pot or the player across the map.",
