  "description": "<i>KickIt</i> is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up for the Amiga. It is a minimalist brawler where there is only one kind of enemy, you have only one kind of attack, there are no weapons or power-ups, and there is no multiplayer mode. The challenge comes from the fact that your attacks always need to be well-timed: taking damage from an enemy is an instant game over, and the enemies move faster and faster as you progress from one area to the next.<br><br>The joystick is used to control the Laiban, an enigmatic character who only wears a large, fish-shaped hat. The plot of the game is that the Laiban recently rented a video game from a game rental place across town, and has forgotten to return it in time. In response, the rental place has deployed wave after wave of bloodthirsty zombies, heading straight towards the Laiban. In each area you need to kick every zombie in the face -- you can jump, but not high enough to jump over a zombie -- which causes a bell to ring, signifying that the wave is over, and you can move on to the next area. The ultimate goal is to return the rented game, pacifying the zombie horde.",
