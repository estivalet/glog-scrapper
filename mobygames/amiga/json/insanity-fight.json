  "description": "This shoot 'em up scrolls vertically at constant speed. As well as waves of aliens, there are lots of mounted structures to be shot before they can shoot you. One regular enemy is a large spaceship, similar to the goose in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/swiv\">SWIV</a>. You have five lives initially (with extras on offer for every 15,000 points), and the screen displays how many enemies you've killed thus far. It also displays the high score and (unusually) a bar indicating how high up the high score table you've reached.",
