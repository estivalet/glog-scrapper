  "description": "<i>The Last Inca</i> is a traditional text-adventure with a sparse use of graphics. <br><br>The evil wizard Zulphosi was imprisoned by the three great wizards of the Galapagos islands. After their death he escapes and starts seeking a magical object, the crown of power, to fulfill his revenge against the wizards' allies, the Inca nation. The player controls a Inca hero in a quest to find several treasures, including the fore-mentioned crown, in order to thwart Zulphosi's plans.<br><br>The game has a basic parser that accepts chain commands and pronouns. Some objects are described but not recognized, and nonsensical messages are very common (sometimes while talking to a game character, a game object starts to answer the input questions, i.e. &quot;the jar says&quot; and so forth). The functions keys have ten predefined commands that can be altered by the mouse-click menu (it can also print the text and switch the music on and off).",
