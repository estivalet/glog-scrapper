Level two is the Risk course. This one will have you planting dynamite and throwing grenades.<br><br>Level three has the player going hand-to-hand in the Combat course. The fourth level combines the previous three levels into one, and finally, the fifth level is a custom &quot;Cobra&quot; course that throws random elements from all the courses at the player.<br><br>To give the game replay value, there is a course construction set so that you can make your own levels.
