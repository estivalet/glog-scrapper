  "description": "<i>Ziriax</i> is a side-scrolling futuristic &quot;shoot-'em-up&quot; set in a futuristic environment, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=R-Type\">R-Type</a>. The player controls a spaceship-like aircraft that is trying to survive amidst the fire of hostile ships and other enemies. There are five stages in the game altogether; each contains a fight against a boss enemy at the end. Small spheres are dropped by enemies; collecting these spheres bestows the player-controlled ship with various power-ups. These include two additional small ships above and below the main one, an ability to shoot backwards, and missiles that can be shot diagonally.",
