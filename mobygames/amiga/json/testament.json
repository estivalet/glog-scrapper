  "description": "You are a soldier on an expedition to find the crypt of the ancient magus Ghuwta, the mightiest of the sorcerors and ruler of an empire 4 000 years ago. Or at least you were, until you were separated from your group. Now your task is simply to survive, and eventually find your way out of the haunted lands you are trapped in. Unfortunately, the way out seems to involve finding and defeating Ghuwta's ghost.<br><br>Testament is a horror-themed Doom clone, set outside and inside graveyards, catacombs and dungeons filled with ancient fantasy monsters. On each level you will find a scroll, a piece of the ”testament” of the title. This will allow you to save your progress and move on to the next level.<br><br>The engine is very similar to the original Doom, with no ability to look up and down, little in the way of lighting effects and bitmapped monsters. On the other hand, it does have fading light into the distance and a map overlay, and runs on an unexpanded Amiga 1200.",
