An analog rudder control has been added (you can still use the mouse), and also an optional rear view, using a second Amiga and monitor connected with a special parallel cable.<br><br>Scorekeeping and tournament modes has also been added, and there is a simple replay mode, in which you can review the last minute of your flight, from your own viewpoint only. There is a 'turbo' panning function to move around the map quicker, which also has updated scenery. You can play single-player against 1-2 computer controlled pilots, or two human players using modem or null-modem connection. <br><br>There are now sixteen selectable WW2 aircraft to choose from:\n<ul>Five from USA:<br>\n<li>Chance Vought F4U Corsair\n<li>North American P-51 Mustang\n<li>Lockheed P-38L Lightning\n<li>Republic P-47 Thunderbolt\n<li>Grumman F6F Hellcat</li></ul>\n<ul>Five British:<br>\n<li>Supermarine Spitfire Mk I\n<li>Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX\n<li>Hawker Hurricane\n<li>Hawker Tempest\n<li>Supermarine Seafire</li></ul>\n<ul>Three German:<br>\n<li>Messerschmitt Me 109E\n<li>Messerschmitt Me 109G\n<li>Focke-Wulf Fw 190</li></ul>\n<ul>Three Japanese:<br>\n<li>Mitsubishi A6M Zero\n<li>Kawanishi N1K2 Shiden (George)\n<li>Kyushu J7W Shinden</li></ul>\n(The J7W is a canard-wing prototype which did not take active part in the war).",
