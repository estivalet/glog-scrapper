  "description": "Gravity Power was a specially licensed version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gravity-force-2\">Gravity Force II</a> for the staff of Amiga Power magazine. As such it was only released on that magazine's issue 50 cover disk.<br><br>Gravity Power took the tiny arrow ship from the classic Asteroids, put in another one and made them fight against each other, with the aid of astonishing weaponry and refueling pads, and with the impediment of lethal landscapes, tricky tunnels and automatic wall-mounted ship-seeking cannons.<br><br>You could also, if you wanted to, fly under the water and, if you really wanted to, use the Gravity Force II editor to build your own levels.",
