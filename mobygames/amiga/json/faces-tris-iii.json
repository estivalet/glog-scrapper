  "description": "Rotating falling blocks in a set way is the aim in this follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/welltris\">Welltris</a>, but the concept here is very different. The falling shapes represent parts of people's faces, which must be arranged and rotated to form complete human-looking faces, ideally matching that of a famous person or other face. You can use a paint package to draw a face to import, which each of the 60 faces has appropriate background music. There are 10 difficulty levels and an optional head-to-head mode.",
