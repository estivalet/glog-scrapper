  "description": "<i>Belial</i> is 2D side-scrolling platform game, clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ghosts+%27N+Goblins\">Ghosts 'N Goblins</a>, without story in-game. The player controls a bearded man, who can shoot small bullets. He goes into the right side of the screen, shoots various enemies (like zombies, bouncing Jack-o'-lanterns, jumping one-eyed monsters, plants etc.), and jumps over obstacles and holes. The game hasn't restarted points - when players lost life, he returns to starting point on each level.",
