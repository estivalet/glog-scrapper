  "description": "<i>Starlord</i> is a game of exploration and conquest from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,17924/\">Mike Singleton</a>, the author of the similarly-focused <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/midwinter\">Midwinter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lords+Midnight\">The Lords of Midnight</a>. As the title implies, Starlord is set in a science-fiction world, as opposed to the fantasy universes of those previous games.<br><br>Your family are Starlords of a single planet, but seek dominance of a vast space consisting of 1000 individually-ruled planets. If you are to come out on top you will have to manage resources across each of your starbases, using revenue to ensure enough fuel, food and minerals are available. Trade with other leaders and form tactical agreements.<br><br>To actually take over planets, you will have to lead your ships into space combat, which is played out in multiple-view 3D.",
