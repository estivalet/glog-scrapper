  "description": "<i>Zeewolf</i> is an arcadesque helicopter combat game in a 3D surrounding, with similar gameplay as the isometric <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/desert-strike-return-to-the-gulf\">Desert Strike</a>. Despite its mainly action-oriented gameplay, the 32 levels often involve support, transport and rescue missions. For example, dropping or refueling friendly units in the combat zone. In exchange, other units serve you as rearming points or help you fighting the enemy. Mission objectives include destroying enemy units, rescuing P.O.W.s and dropping them off at an aircraft carrier, escorting a reconnaissance plane, re-taking a captured base, dropping off a spy and more.<br><br>The order of the levels can be chosen freely and the game may be played with joystick or - a little unusual - with the mouse. The game uses a third-person 3D engine, looking at the helicopter from the side and displaying a certain amount of landmass in a square around it. The game engine looks very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/virus__\">Zarch</a>.with additional features like support for segmented spheres and domes, fire and water splash effects, and a simultaneous gameplay and map display mode.",
