  "description": "<i>Erik</i> is a platform game that scrolls vertically but not horizontally. The titular hero is a friendly viking whose peaceful living is disrupted when the evil god Loki is reincarnated. Not happy with Erik's refusal to join the pursuits of more violent vikings, Loki casts a spell on the lands turning the world into a terrible place. Erik's now has to overcome all the dangers so that he once again can live in peace.<br><br>The game consists of four worlds, each divided into seven levels. The last level of each world contains a guardian that has to be defeated for Erik to be able to move on to the next world. On his journey, Erik will come across many monsters and traps to overcome but cash in the form of jewels can also be found. Collected jewels can be used in shops to acquire extra weapons, shields and lives. In each world there are also two secret rooms where Erik can get extra lives and weapons that are not available in the shops. ",
