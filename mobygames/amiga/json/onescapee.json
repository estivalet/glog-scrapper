  "description": "<i>onEscapee</i> is an adventure game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Flashback\">Flashback</a>. Daniel White is a reluctant hero, having been abducted by aliens and ended up on a dumping planet; alone, abandoned and with little chance of returning to civilization or stopping the mysterious alien race in question from continuing to abduct humans.<br><br>There are seven levels to get through before things come to an end, containing many puzzles and action moments, many of the puzzles being timing-sensitive. It is possible to die in several different ways, each death bringing an animated sequence to life. There is plenty of help for the early puzzles, which allows the player to adjust to the combat system.",
