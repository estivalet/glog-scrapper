  "description": "In this dungeon-crawling RPG you must assemble a team of four brave fighters to launch an attack on Pendugmalhe, and save the kingdom of Kalynthia. The main gameplay is influenced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dungeon-master\">Dungeon Master</a>, but features sections in the open air battling bears as well as the dungeons. <br><br>In the real-time combat sections you must choose weapons and spells instantaneously, using the mouse-based interface. You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/abandoned-places-a-time-for-heroes\">the first game</a> to load in.",
