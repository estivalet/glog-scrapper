  "description": "Numerix is a board game for two players (of which one may be a computer-controlled opponent) that take it in turns to place shaped pieces onto a board. Each piece may cover one or several squares, and when played onto the board, the piece must be adjacent to any existing piece, with the exception of the first piece played.<br><br>On approximately half of the squares on the board, there are numbers denoting the value of playing a piece which covers that square, once a piece is played the total value of all numbers on squares covered it is totalled up and added to the player's score. The game ends when all pieces are played and the player with the highest score wins.<br><br>There are four distinct board styles available, each with their own matching piece styles, and the layout of points on each board is different.<br><br>Lastly, not all squares can be played upon immediately, even if the move would otherwise be legal; the central area of each board is coloured in a lighter colour, and these areas are permitted at all times, but the border areas are all in darker colour - pieces may not be played onto the darker areas without the player having first achieved 75 points.",
