  "description": "Up to four players compete on the Stock Market to make their fortune, by investing in a portfolio of stocks. There are oil companies, car companies and airlines, all with graphs of performance to predict trends from. Bear in mind economic trends as they unfold. You can take out a loan of up to $5m, which must be paid back with interest later. Instructions are largely built into the game, in a way rarely used before the CD-ROM era.",
