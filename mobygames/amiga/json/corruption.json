  "description": "<i>Corruption</i> is one of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Magnetic+Scrolls\">Magnetic Scrolls'</a> interactive fiction games. The player takes control of a stockbroker on the fast track to riches. Suddenly, there are attempts on his life, with the words 'insider dealings' floating around. The hero is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and must prove his innocence before it is too late.<br><br>The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.",
