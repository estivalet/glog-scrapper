  "description": "Steg the slug has to feed his family of &quot;T'yungunz&quot;.  To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.<br><br>The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches.<br><br>Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can construct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.   ",
