  "description": "<i>Rocks 'n' Diamonds</i> is a puzzle game, based on the concept of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a>. The player's goal on each level is to collect all the gems and reach the exit, avoiding hazards (such as falling rocks or hostile monsters) and solving puzzles (e.g. skillfully digging sand from under rocks so that they fall in the right way, giving access to some gems). <br><br>The game comes with a level editor, and with 4 sets of levels, which are converted versions of levels from the classic games: <i>Boulder Dash</i>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Supaplex\">Supaplex</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/emerald-mines\">Emerald Mine</a>... and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sokoban\">Sokoban</a>, a different puzzle game where the player's goal is to push objects into proper places. The <i>Supaplex</i> levels feature the graphics from the original Amiga game. <br><br>An enterprising level designer will quickly find out that the level editor contains tons of possible elements to cram into the map - there are countless types of monsters, many different types of gems, some keys and doors, switches, and other interesting elements. <br><br>The game can be played with up to 4 players simultaneously on one computer.
