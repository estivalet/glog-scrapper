  "description": "An extension of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=I+Play+3-D+Soccer\">I Play: 3-D Soccer</a>, with a new section for planning the team tactics and a more complex simulation of a championship. Most of the core game code of predecessor was reused.<br><br>Selecting the championship of Italy, England, or Germany, you should lead your team to the first place. Before the match begins you may adjust the list of team players and their formation on the field. When the match begins, you should move your player in 3rd-person view to run to appropriate position, try to catch or to get the ball, and want to make a score. While you are moving on the field, the map shows the position of the ball and other players. Commentator watches the match and tells either who is controlling the ball now, or what event was occurred on the field.",
