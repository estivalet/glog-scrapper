  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/archon-the-light-and-the-dark\">Archon</a>, <i>Archon II: Adept</i> features a more complex board and enhanced gameplay.<br><br>Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.",
