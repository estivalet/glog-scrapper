  "description": "This tennis simulation followed up <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Simulmondo\">Simulmundo</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=3D+World+Boxing\">3D World Boxing</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3d-world-soccer\">3D World Soccer</a> was the final game in the series. There is some sports management involved as the player you choose (from pre-built selection or from your own creation) can improve his skills (forehand, backhand, serve, volley, etc.) as he wins matches and prize money and moves up in the rankings.  <br><br>There's 4 different play options: Singles Match, Singles Tournament, Grand Slam, and ATP Tour.  You must be qualified to play for the last two options based on your current ranking.  Beating opponents ranked higher will move your own ranking higher more quickly.<br><br>The playing view is directly from behind the player but as you approach the net it is scaled to always be appropriate for what the player would see from that vantage point. The players are viewed in large well-animated forms and even the backgrounds of crowd scenes are also animated.  At the bottom of the screen there are player's photos and ability bar graphs as well as a small overhead view of the player's positions on the court.",
