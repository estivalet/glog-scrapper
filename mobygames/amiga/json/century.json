  "description": "<i>Century</i> is based on the physical puzzle games in which a ball has to guided through a labyrinth by tilting the board. The basic principle of this game is identical and the tilting is simulated by moving the mouse in the appropriate direction. The player has to navigate the ball through the maze, collect a number of symbols and in the end bring the ball back to the starting position. If the ball falls in a hole, a life is lost.",
