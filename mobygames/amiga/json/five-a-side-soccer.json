  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/football-glory\">Football Glory</a> gets a makeover in this recreation of five-a-side football. The basic game engine is much the same, with identical menu systems and similar styling to the team selection (albeit with less players). Gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sensible+Soccer\">Sensible Soccer</a>, with loose ball control (although there are 3 options for this), small playing sprites and an emphasis on ground passing, plus a few speech bubble comments when the ball goes dead.<br><br>Two distinct sets of 5-a-side rules are featured, English and International, with full explanations of the differences built into the game. There are seven different pitch surfaces, ranging form grass and Astroturf to concrete and plastic, as well as the option of playing without a fence keeping the ball constantly in play. Tournaments and friendlies can be played, using either club or international teams.",
