  "description": "At its most basic level, <i>Zero Gravity</i> can be thought of as a <i>Pong</i> game, as the player controls a bat which must be used to hit a ball as it comes towards you. The main twist is that the gameplay is completely 3-dimensional, with control over the horizontal and vertical positions of the bat. The game uses a split-screen view, with the top half viewed from the perspective of Player 1, and the bottom from that of Player 2, even when only one of them is human.<br><br>Each time you get the ball past your opponent's bat, a score is added to a tally, and a number of points are awarded. Along the side-wall of the playing arena there are 8 tokens to be hit, awarding extra points, speeding the game up, deducting points from your opponent, and so on.",
