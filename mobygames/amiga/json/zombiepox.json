  "description": "Zombies have appeared and turned your once peaceful neighborhood into a nightmare! With your trustworthy brain-dispenser it's up to you to replace the brains of the zombies in order to stop them from taking over completely.<br><br>The game takes place in a graveyard filled with a mixture of humans, zombies and gravestones that get in the way. The objective in <i>Zombiepox</i> is to convert all zombies back into human form; this is done by leaving a brain in their path, when a zombie touches a brain he returns to human.  Humans are turned when touched by zombies (their brain will have been eaten), multiplying your troubles, so it's necessary to constantly intervene.  The screen shows two gauges, on the right is the current level's human to zombie ratio, and on the left is the brain gauge.  You can only place a brain when the gauge is full.  <br><br>If a zombie touches you then you'll be turned, but you can return to human if a brain is on the ground and you can reach it in time.  While in zombie form the controls are reversed (up is down, left is right).  If no brains are on the ground while in zombie form the game is over. <br><br>With each progressive level the light fades, the graveyards get bigger and the number of zombies will increase.<br><br><i>Zombiepox</i> was originally written for the Ludum Dare 48 hour game programming contest in 2004.",
