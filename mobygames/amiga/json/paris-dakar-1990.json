  "description": "The game showcases the African part of the 12th Paris-Dakar rally route officially sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Tomahawk\">Tomahawk</a>. Unlike the previous Paris-Dakar simulation, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/african-raiders-01\">African Raiders-01</a>, in this game the car is controlled directly from the cockpit. The drivers are visible, but the perspective is more 1st person than 3rd person.<br><br>Starting in Tripoli (Lybie), the player races against computer drivers on six stages, visiting checkpoints located in Tumu (Lybie), N'Djamena (Tchad), Niamey (Niger), Néma (Mauritanie), Kayes (Mali), and Dakar (Senegal). The road is marked by rocks on its sides on most stages, and the player should keep his car on the road. If the player misses a road, he has a limited amount of time to find it again, otherwise he will be penalized. On the second and fourth stages there is no road from the start, and the player must reach the finish on his own. The off-road environment is full of rocks, animal corpses, and other debris. The player should not damage the car too much, otherwise he will be penalized as well. When a checkpoint is reached, a thematic animation sequence is shown for relaxation purposes.<br><br>There are three difficulty levels to select from before the start of rally.",
