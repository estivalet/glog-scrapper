  "description": "<i>Inertia Drive</i> is a multi directional scrolling shoot 'em up viewed from a top down perspective. Each of the game's levels consists of a number of gatepods as well as a central installation. The objective is to hit the central installation, but to open up its shields all the gatepods first have to be destroyed. Both gatepods and the central installations have shields with only a small gap to shoot through. In addition to these there are also gate protectors that move after the player in an attempt to crash into him. In addition to avoiding these, the player also has to avoid crashing into the shields as any contact will lead to a lost life. As the title suggests, the ship controls are affected by inertia. This means that once it has started moving in one direction a force in the opposite direction is needed for it to stop.",
