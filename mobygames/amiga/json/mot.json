  "description": "Who is MOT ?\nMOT is nothing less than a 3 meter tall inter-dimensional monster (complete with a tail and horns), which can travel through the planes of time and space as easily as you go from your bedroom to the kitchen. <br><br>Moreover, MOT has the bad habits of hiding in your cupboard, smashing all the furniture in your house from time to time or eating all the food in your fridge during the night.\nAnd of course,  when you tried to explain to your parents that it wasn't you but MOT who crushed their car, they sent you to a psychiatrist.<br><br>But MOT is your friend, and you wouldn't let him down when he calls for your help, would you ?<br><br>\n",
