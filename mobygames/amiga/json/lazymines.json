  "description": "<i>LazyMines</i> is a <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Minesweeper\">Minesweeper</a></i> variant for the Amiga, played in a window on the Workbench. It has all the functions of its Windows ancestor and is totally system friendly, supporting dynamic pen allocation, font sensitivity and localisation. It also has a few amenities; clicking a square with both mouse buttons will reveal all squares around that square, marking any mines. Apart from the usual <i>Minesweeper</i> mode, it has a mode where you start out in one corner and must clear a path to the other end of the minefield. There are three difficulty levels (minefield sizes) as well as a mode where you can choose the size of the minefield at will.<br><br>As of version 3.2, the source is open, and a Java version has also been made by the author.",
