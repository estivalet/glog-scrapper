  "description": "In <i>Black Magic</i> your job is to move a little wizard using the joystick and collect up the diamonds in the upper and underworlds and fill baskets with them and then successfully find the exit to the level. <br><br>Besides the standard blue diamonds, if you happen to collect a green diamond, the enemies stand still momentarily. A four-carat diamond counts as four diamonds which happens to be the maximum number of diamonds that you can carry, which makes it much faster than collecting them individually. Either find your four diamonds and exit or stay and eliminate all of the enemies before exiting the level.<br><br>Collect helpful extras along the way to make your job easier. A shovel to help clear the way. A shot to destroy your enemy with one shot. A special shot will allow your shots to keep rebounding of the walls until they hit an enemy or until you intercept the shot. Lightning to destroy enemies to your right and left. Like fruit? A strawberry gives you an energy boost, a grape gives you 40 bonus points, while an apple can destroy an enemy if you are able to get it to fall on top of them. Are you up to the challenge?",
