  "description": "<i>Nucleus</i> is a two dimensional side-scrolling sci-fi shoot'em up with slow-paced action. The player controls a space ship and must destroy the electric core of a synthetic planet called Cetorium to defeat a dangerous alien race. He flies left to right and collects bonuses and power ups to increase the ship's firepower. Extra weapons look like the levitating options from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a>,but there are several types. Various enemies have to be shot and at the end of levels there are fights against large bosses. The game has a specific organic/plant style with resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/x-multiply\">X Multiply</a>. Most of the enemies aren't space ships but rather bugs and bacteria-like creatures. Also the game's environments look organic. The game has one-hit-death and the player has only a few ships to use. There are six stages.",
