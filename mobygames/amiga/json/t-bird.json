  "description": "Players control a Foourd T-Bird, a transportation system capable of great speeds up to 1346 mph. Their job is to destroy the swarms of aliens – including flying saucers, tie fighters, space jellyfish, unidentifiable blobs, and the like – and dodge their fire. This can be achieved by shooting them with the standard zapper or use a smart missile to destroy everything in sight. <br><br>When an entire swarm is destroyed, getting the token that appears give the player a roving sight, sideways-firing missiles, extra lives, extra missiles, and so on. Between each swarm, a meteor shower appears, and players need to avoid being hit. At the end of each level, players have to destroy a guardian to proceed to the next, and the smart missiles cannot be used to destroy them.\n",
