  "description": "<em>T-Racer</em> is a traditional single-player horizontal shooter largely influenced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/project-x\">Project-X</a>, as admitted by the developers themselves. The player guides a lone spaceship across a series of levels infested with all kinds of enemies appearing in waves with insidious attack patterns. Each level is divided into two sublevels and ends with a bonus 3D tunnel section that plays like the third phase of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars\">Star Wars arcade game</a>.<br><br>The ship's arsenal can be improved by collecting power-ups. Each level has a fixed set of power-ups which are obtained by destroying specific enemies, often hidden amidst a wave of identical enemies. The amount of missed power-ups, if any, is indicated at the end of each sublevel. The ship has an energy bar as well as a stealth bar, which in fact functions as temporary invulnerability that can be arbitrarily activated and deactivated by the player until depleted. The weaponry is not reduced upon loss of a life. Along with the standard ordnance, some power-ups also provide special weapons with limited ammunition.",
