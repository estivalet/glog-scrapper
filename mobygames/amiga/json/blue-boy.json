  "description": "<em>Blue Boy</em> is a hybrid between a beat'em up, a shooter and a precursor to what in modern terms is called a &quot;tower defense&quot; game. As flying superhero Blue Boy, the player travels around the world in an attempt to thwart alien raids in major cities.<br><br>The goal of every level is to prevent the aliens from abducting the population that wanders around the lower portion of the level. Blue Boy may freely fly around the level and can use punches, lasers and other weapon to eliminate the alien threat. If an alien manages to capture a human, the player must quickly eliminate the captor before they both fly off the level. As the enemies may appear anywhere in the level, the player must carefully plan the order in which to respond to threats, in a similar fashion as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Missile+Command\">Missile Command</a>. Some aliens will directly attack the player instead of attempting to abduct humans. Once freed from their captors, humans can be released from their cocoons in order to obtain bonuses, such as additional weapons, smart bombs and extra lives, though doing so may distract from other ongoing abductions.<br><br>An attack wave is completed when all the aliens have been eliminated and there are some humans left. For every city there are two attack waves and a boss fight with a spaceship. If Blue Boy loses all his lives, or if all the humans are abducted, the game is over. A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Defender\">Defender</a>-like mini map allows the player to keep track of the aliens and humans around the level.",
