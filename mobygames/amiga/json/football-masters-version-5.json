  "description": "<i>Football Masters (Version 5)</i> is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control over a team of the first four UK divisions. As most British games of its genre, the focus is clearly on the athletic side of the sports: line-up, training and tactics. Finances are mostly restricted to the transfer market. Each athlete has seven skills and special talents which influence his performance on the field. The matches are shown in a wide, abstract overhead view; penalty shots play out with a mini game. The difficulty can be adjusted in three steps in addition to the possibility to automate certain aspects of the game.",
