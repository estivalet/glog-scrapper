  "description": "<i>Rules of Engagement 2</i> is a mouse-driven starship command simulation in which the player assigns ships and captains to task forces under his/her command, while maintaining direct control of a flagship. The user interface is something like a functional version of the LCARS system seen in the TV show <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>.<br><br>The game is also part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/breach-2\">Breach 2</a>, allowing the player to command the troops via that game (e.g. when boarding an enemy ship).<br><br>Unlike its predecessor, this sequel features digitized speech for the A.N.D.I. computer. <br><br>A full campaign editor is included with the game, making it possible to create missions and campaigns and even share them with others.",
