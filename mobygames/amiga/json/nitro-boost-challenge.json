  "description": "In <i>Nitro Boost Challenge</i>, the player takes the role of a stunt man who has to drive a car through five dangerous film scenes. This game is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player has to dodge bombs dropped from the sky, other cars which use guns to damage the player's vehicle and stationary obstacles on the ground. The player has a gun to shoot back, but the main challenge is to finish the course within the time limit. The player can control the speed of the car and use nitro pills for a temporary boost. If too much damage is sustained, the player dies. ",
