  "description": "<i>Death Trap</i> is a side-scrolling platform game with light puzzle-solving elements that usually don't go further than finding levers to get through to the next part of the map. The theme of the game is medieval fantasy and it takes place in a castle (divide into five levels) which is where the trap in the title comes from. The trap has been set up by the magician king Shankriya and has been existing for five centuries. It's the players job to make things right again. The game has a wide variety of enemies from ghosts to fireball throwing magicians. Defeating some enemies gives the player the player a flask with some liquid that can be converted into spells and such. <br><br>\n",
