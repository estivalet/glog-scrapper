  "description": "Strategy based war game set in the future &quot;where wars are fought in virtual reality&quot;. What this means is that you control your forces via a top-down map (like in the popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,19/gameId,5812/\">Battle Isle</a>) but you can switch to a 1st person 3D wireframe perspective of your units for &quot;special missions&quot;.<br><br>The game boasted &quot;incredibly realistic virtual 3D&quot; which meant having to don the 3D glasses that came with the game during the wireframe 3D sections.",
