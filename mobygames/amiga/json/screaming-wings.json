  "description": "A top-down vertically scrolling shoot ‘em up with a World War 2 feel resembling 1942. You pilot your aeroplane through 9 levels of forests, fields and oceans. You’ll be facing hordes of enemy planes and their bullets, contact with which costs you one of your 3 lives. You can dart slightly off the screen to dodge bullets, similarly to SWIV. A number of power-ups are available, including a drone weapon which will shoot from the opposite position as you (for example, if you’re 75% of the way across the screen, it will be 25% of the way across).
