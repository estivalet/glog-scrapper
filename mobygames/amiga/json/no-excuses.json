  "description": "<i>No Excuses</i> is a single-screen game with a lot of blasting and dodging. You play a little insect life form whose sole purpose in life is to destroy all the free-roaming aliens in each of his world's 50 planes.<br><br>On each of the 50 levels, there are varying kinds and amounts of aliens. These vary from airborne greenies that swoop lower each time they pass, reach ground level then fly directly upwards and reappear somewhere else to do their amazing swooping trick again. Then there are the aliens that swoop down, land on the ground and sit waiting to be shot. Finally, there are the aliens that swoop,land and shoot at you from ground level.",
