  "description": "Having simulated modern-day planes with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/flight-of-the-intruder\">Flight of the Intruder</a>, and World War 2 with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Overlord\">Overlord</a>, Rowan brought World War 1 to life in this flight simulation. It is structured around an illustrated book with pilot biographies, all of which modify as the game goes on and events unfold. 150 missions are featured, each with fully inter-linked briefings. There are 13 different fighter planes to fly, both Allied and German (Fokker Dr.I, Fokker Eindecker, Fokker D.VII, Albatros D.I, D.II, D.III, Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a, Airco DH.2, Sopwith Pup, Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Triplane, Nieuport Scout, SPAD VII).",
