  "description": "<i>Dodge These Balls</i> is a simple arcade action game. The player takes control of a red ball that is viewed from a top-down perspective. On the screen are also three grey balls that bounce around it. The aim of the game is, as the title says, to avoid touching these. Any contact with a ball will lead to an instant game over. As the game goes on it gets harder as more grey balls are added. The player's objective is simply to stay alive as long as possible. On mobile platforms the ball is controlled by tilting the device. The Amiga version features online leaderboards through the developer's AmiBoing website.",
