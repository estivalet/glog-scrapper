  "description": "During the Second World War there was a scientific rivalry between the two sides, who wanted at all costs to produce what would later be called the atomic bomb. One of the most important elements for the development of this ultimate weapon was the heavy water and the Nazis had built a factory in Telemark, from which manufacture large quantities of this important component.<br><br>There were only two solutions to this: to make the atomic bomb before the Germans, which was quite unlikely, or to sabotage the heavy water plant in Telemark. The latter is the solution that has been taken. And you're going to have to help them.<br><br>The game is a typical side-scrolling arcade with a single man fighting against everything that crosses his way and its composed of four distinct phases: the surroundings of the factory, underground corridors leading into the interior, the interior itself, and finally, the office area. In order to end with all the Nazi soldiers (who are many) you're armed with a rifle with scant ammunition, only ten cartridges, and some grenades.",
