  "description": "<i>Accumulus</i> is a small puzzle game for playing on the Workbench desktop, bearing some similarities to <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pick-n-pile\">Pick 'n Pile</a></i>. The playfield consists of eight columns of varying height, containing various blocks of different shapes and colours. Click any block eleminates it, causing the blocks above to fall down. Points are only granted if all the falling blocks fall in a position where no two blocks of the same kind are adjacent, with higher points granted for the number of falling blocks, which is the main strategic element of <i>Accumulus</i>.",
