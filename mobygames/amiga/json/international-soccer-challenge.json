  "description": "<i>International Soccer Challenge</i> is loosely a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/keith-van-erons-pro-soccer\">MicroProse Soccer</a> and it has many similarities to the original, including the way the ball sticks to your player's foot. The major difference is the visual perspective, which is in pure 3D, viewed just behind the ball as you move up the pitch, with full polygons and some shading. You have a radar on screen to allow you to see where your team-mates are, which reduces the disadvantage of not being able to look behind you.<br><br>Two tournaments are featured - a superleague and a recreated World Cup, as well as practice modes. By moving the joystick as you shoot, you can adjust the direction and height of a pass or shot, allowing for a wide range of moves.",
