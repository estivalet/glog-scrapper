Once there, he must fight a succession of 11 opponents, one at a time, with gameplay resembling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Street+Fighter+II\">Street Fighter 2</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>.<br><br>The game's graphics used similar rotoscoping techniques (similar to those used in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Flashback\">Flashback</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Prince+of+Persia\">Prince of Persia</a>) making Shaq's 7'2&quot; frame is represented. As well as the story mode, the player can play individual fights, either with 1 or 2 players, although one human player must always be Shaq. Shaq can jump a huge distance, although he struggles to block.",
