  "description": "As the Yellow tribe on a remote island, you must ultimately conquer every territory against your two rivals in this strategic God-game. The look has a very cutesy non-serious edge, and the whole feel of the game is casual. Your men fight with catapults and ride on horseback. You must keep some on guard duties, balancing this against how many you send off to attack other territories, in which case you must wait and see the outcome. You get more men as the game goes on, ultimately increasing the status of your bases, and this isn’t dependent on how many are kept back, unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mega-lo-mania\">Megalomania’s</a> breeding effect.
