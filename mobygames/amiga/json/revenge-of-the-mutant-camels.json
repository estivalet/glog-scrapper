  "description": "This typically zany <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,12816/\">Jeff Minter</a>  title sets you as a mutated camel, with an optional support one mimicking your moves elsewhere. The hordes of enemies to be taken on include falling umbrellas and drinks machines. Shot enemies release tokens ranging from points bonuses and energy recharges to control-reversers and poison.<br><br>Speaking of controls, the game uses the same system as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Llamatron\">Llamatron</a>, which means that you fire automatically in the direction you're moving, but pressing the fire button allows you to rotate the direction of fire while immobile. This allows enemies in different parts of the screen to be attacked from less precarious positions.",
