  "description": "As a child, you were never taught of your family's dark secret - a whole history of 'evil twins' doing Satan's work on Earth, and 'good twins' attempting to put this right. Your uncle informs you of this shortly before his death, and after travelling to his castle you find that you must travel through time to correct these wrongdoings. \nThrough a range of murals at your uncle's house, various past scenes must be entered, with more becoming available as you complete them. In each you must find and kill your demented relative in time.<br><br><i>WaxWorks</i> is a hybrid game that combines elements of role-playing and adventure. The player explores maze-like locations, manipulating objects and solving puzzles. Enemies appear from time to time and must be defeated using the various weapons found in the game. The player receives experience points and fathers equipment in a RPG fashion in each WaxWork; however, completing one negates these effects, and the protagonist becomes more defenseless in the next location. The game's controls are point and click, with the interface allowing the player to examine and collect items, select a weapon, and attack potential foes by striking at a particular part of their body.",
