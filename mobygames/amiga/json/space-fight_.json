  "description": "A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=space-invaders-\">Space Invaders</a> clone where the player controls a space craft that has to eliminate an incoming alien horde. The player's ship moves horizontally across the bottom and shoots at the advancing columns of aliens. The aliens move across the screen left to right, then one column down, then they start to go from right to left, repeating the process until either they are all eliminated or they get to the bottom in which case the player loses. The aliens can shoot back and there are three barriers between the player ship and the aliens that can be used as a short of shielding that erodes as they are shot. The aliens shoot back and a hit will eliminate one of the five starting lives. Once these are out, it's game over.",
