  "description": "In a grim future, the people are kept under control by a horde of genetically-modified beings who look identical to everyone else, and appear to act the same, but are subtly controlling minds and actions. This works perfectly for Centro-Holographis until two of their droids, Hammerfist (male) and Metalisis (female) malfunction. They try to put things right, and come under your control in this side-view action game with adventure elements.<br><br>You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep the doors locked.",
