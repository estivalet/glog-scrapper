With this money you decide to enter the hotel business trying to rise from a small unimportant boarding-house to a Steigenberger Hotel being one of the most famous hotels in the world.<br>\n<br>\nThis management simulation lets you take care for all important decisions a hotel manager has to make. This ranges from staff management, pricing, public relations / advertising to gastronomy and more. The game is mouse-driven and supports up to 4 human players. A time limit can be entered after which the turn of players will end.",
