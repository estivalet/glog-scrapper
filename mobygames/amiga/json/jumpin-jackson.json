  "description": "Jumpin' Jackson is a top-down puzzle game. Jackson hops around a game board, picking up records (anyone remember vinyl?) and putting them down on record players. Each record carries one instrument's part of a tune, and as the records are put down, the tune builds up. Once all the records are spinning, the tune and level are completed.<br><br>Blocking your way are a variety of violent musical instruments - violins, trumpets, bass drums.",
