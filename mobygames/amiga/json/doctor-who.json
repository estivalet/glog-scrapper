  "description": "In this game you get to take control of the Doctor and try to find the key to time. The story involves you collecting the 6 pieces of the key to time which are dropped by one of the many adversaries you encounter on each level. <br><br>The doctor has only one weapon at his disposal which is his trusty sonic screwdriver which freezes all the enemies on the level for a few seconds. The doctor can trick the monsters into colliding with each other as they try to attack him.Your quest is also hampered by the master who pops up randomly through the game and steals the pieces of the key to time whilst at the same time killing you. Luckily you have 7 lives and each time you die you regenerate into a different incarnation and you have companions to help who are controlled by player 2.",
