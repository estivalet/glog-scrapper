  "description": "The game is one of a series of educational titles from Scetlander, dedicated to children under 5 years: with the help of Maggie the Loch Ness monster as the host, they are to learn how to match different objects together. <br><br>There are three major mini-game modes available: &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (matching pictures, shapes, letters or numbers), &quot;Odd One Out&quot; (identifying the odd picture, shape, letter or number), &quot;Forget-me-not&quot; (pictures, shapes, letters or numbers are being 'flashed' on screen - after that the correct match has to be identified), as well as &quot;Clock and Calendar&quot; mode (which just displays the internal clock and calendar in either digital or analogue form).
