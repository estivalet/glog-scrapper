  "description": "Just as the title says, <i>Yet Another Tetris Clone</i> is a close clone of Tetris. Coloured blocks (or monochrome, if chosen) drop down and use them to form horizontal lines, thereby eliminating them.<br><br>The game has a lot of options, such as supporting all of the Amiga's native screen modes, from a low resolution to a high resolution interlace, while being multitasking friendly and running on its own screen. Both keyboard and joystick control are supported, while dropping blocks can both be done smoothly or instantaneously. If the player tires of playing, the computer can continue playing. One thing that sets the game apart from other <i>Tetris</i> variants is the revenge mode, where the computer plays while the player gets to choose which blocks are dropped.",
