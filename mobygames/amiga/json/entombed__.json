  "description": "<i>Entombed!</i> is a clone of the Atari 2600 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Entombed\">Entombed</a>. The player takes on the role of an archaeologist, part of a team fallen into the catacombs of the zombies. The screen scrolls vertically at a fixed pace and gradually speeds up as the player progresses. The goal is to survive, while progressing to prevent disappearing through the top of the screen. There are hazards to avoid and potions can be used to create and destroy walls. Destroying walls is needed to create passages, while constructing them can hold back a chasing enemy.<br><br>The game supports one or two players.",
