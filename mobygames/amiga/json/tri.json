  "description": "In <i>Tri</i>, you must move a jointed line on a pegged board to replicate a pattern. You pull the joints between the different pegs, but the line cannot be broken, and the lines between the joints can only stretch between two adjacent pegs. Hence, you must take your time moving the line around the pyramid-shaped board to reach the desired shape. It is possible to get stuck, so you need to judge your moves carefully. The game plays in a resizable window on the Workbench screen and is totally mouse-controlled.",
