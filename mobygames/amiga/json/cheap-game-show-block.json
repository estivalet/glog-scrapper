  "description": "Tcgs-block is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Breakout+Variants\">Breakout</a> game, originally for the Sony PSP, influenced by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Touhou\">T?h?</a> series of maniac shoot'em'ups, particularly <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/perfect-cherry-blossom\">Perfect Cherry Blossom</a>.<br><br>The basic Breakout gameplay remains; launch balls from a paddle and bounce them at bricks. What is added, in direct reference to mania shooters, apart from manga-style girls in the background, is the frantic multi-ball gameplay. You start out with a reserve of balls of which you can launch as many as you wish to try your luck. When you run out of balls, which is more probable the more balls that are on-screen, the game is over. Nevertheless, launching several balls at once yields higher scores in accordance with the higher difficulty level. Just as in T?h? games, hitting enemies – or bricks in this instance – releases score symbols that are absorbed by your bat.",
