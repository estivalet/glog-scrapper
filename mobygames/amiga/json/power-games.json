  "description": "<i>Power-Games</i> is a compilation of over 500 games for the Amiga, CD32 and CDTV. The games are stored both unpacked and as compressed LHA archives on the CD-ROM. When booting the CD on a CD32, a graphical menu is displayed where compatible games can be selected and launched by genre. However, some of the games require either a mouse, a keyboard or both. The games are mostly freeware and shareware, with a couple of commercial demos available as well.",
