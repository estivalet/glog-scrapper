  "description": "<i>BattleSet 2: North Atlantic Convoys</i> (NACV) was the first add-on for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Harpoon\">Harpoon</a>, featuring 16 scenarios playable from both sides of the conflict. The hypothetical setting is akin to BattleSet 1: it is 1990, the full scale war between NATO and USSR rages on, Soviets are attempting to cut allied supply convoys, just as the Germans did during the previous world wars, while NATO has to employ the old &amp; tried escort tactics. This way the new map got expanded to North Atlantic and the database received new ships, aircraft, submarines and weapons of Western and Soviet origin.",
