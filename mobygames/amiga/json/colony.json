The landing drained your ship of all but minimal power, stranding you.<br><br>After putting on your Power Armor, navigating the planet's surface and stepping into the Colony itself, you must uncover what has happened to the colonists, restore power to your ship, and, optionally, rescue the colonist's children.",
