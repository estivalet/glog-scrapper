  "description": "Hundreds of thousands of years into the future, the descendants of mankind live on artificial planets in a solar system far away from the long ago destroyed planet Earth. One day, an evil being finds out the secret of the energy produced within the deserted planet of Kobaia, and he does not intend to use that power for the good of his fellow man. Warriors from all the planets in the system set out to stop him. However, being descendents of the warlike mankind, they will not hesitate to fight each other as well...<br><br>With this premise, Olofight is a futuristic beat'em'up. Eight characters are available to choose from, each with their own special powers. Apart from the usual kicks, jumps and punches, which are accessible through a simple system tailored for one-button joysticks, four special attacks are available by loading a power meter. These attacks are expendible, though, so once the allotted number of attacks have been used up, the fighters will have to rely on their conventional powers. When an opponent is defeated, you can learn special moves from them, and customise your moves before matches.<br><br>Four one-player modes are available: <ul><li>The story mode takes you through the entire character gallery one at a time. <li>The survival mode does the same but doesn't reset your life bar at the beginning of each fight; the challenge here is how many opponents you can defeat in a row.<li>Time attack mode gives you a set time limit to finish your opponents.<li>Single battle lets you fight any character you want and then return to the menu.</ul>\nOf course, a two-player mode is also available.<br><br>The developers of Olofight put a lot of emphasis on technicalities. The game uses a lot of colours, more than is usually available on an AGA screen (early previews made claims of using the HAM-8 mode with 262 144 colours, which would be a world first). All characters and backgrounds are raytraced, as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rise-of-the-robots\">Rise of the Robots</a>, and the background features both several layers of parallax scrolling and perspective distortion on the ground.",
