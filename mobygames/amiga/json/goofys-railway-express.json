  "description": "In <i>Goofy's Railway Express</i>, Goofy and Mickey are railroad conductors helping children with colors and shapes. This is done by a series of screens for young children to start visually identifying shapes and color matching while the train crosses colorful landscapes. <br><br>When the train smoke stack produces colored shapes, such as a square, circle, or triangle, the child must press the spacebar key. If the shape and color matches the shape and color above a Disney character waiting on the train platform, then the train will stop and pick up that passenger. Otherwise an unique animation appears somewhere on the screen for entertainment. ",
