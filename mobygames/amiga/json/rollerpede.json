  "description": "<i>Rollerpede</i> is a single player <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Centipede+variants\">Centipede</a> type game.<br><br>In this game the player controls a gun which can be moved left/right the bottom of the playfield. A centipede starts at the top odf the screen and gradually works its way down the screen, the player's task is to destroy it but when it is shot the body breaks into two sections each of which moves independently. <br>It is usual in games of this type to have mushrooms ans other vegetation scattered around the playing area, this game is no exception however the playing field starts out clear of such stuff and becomes more cluttered as the game progresses. Other nasties such as the spider which destroys the player's gun also make an appearance<br><br>\n",
