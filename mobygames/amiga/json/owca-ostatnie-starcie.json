  "description": "<i>?owca: Ostatnie Starcie</i> is a game loosely based on the Polish movie of the same name. It starts when Thorn and Gaeth kidnap Janik. As a son of Janik the player must finish four mini-games to save his parent. The first stage is a street car race, where the player must avoid collisions with other cars and numerous obstacles such as holes, pools or oil stains. Each collision causes damage to the car, shown through a percentage indicator. The second stage is a platform game. The player must find three items hidden in five rooms before time runs out, avoiding Thorn and Gaeth. In the third stage the player returns to the road, this time driving a motorbike. The same rules apply, but the goal is not only safe driving - the player must catch up with the kidnappers. The last stage takes place in the underground metro. The player must collect all the letters of the password required to disarm the bomb before time runs out.",
