  "description": "This platform game challenges the player to guide a mouse around a screen collecting goodies - varying from cheese to cakes to balloons. Once they have all been collected you must reach the door, doing all of this within the time limit, depicted by a picture of a diffusing bomb.<br><br>The player will have to jump over flowers, dodge bouncing balls and dinosaurs amongst other things - contact with any of these loses a life. Movement is achieved along ledges, via clouds, moving platforms and up ladders. Short falls can be withstood, but larger ones (or heavy landings from jumps) are fatal. ",
