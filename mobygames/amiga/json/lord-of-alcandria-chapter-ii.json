  "description": "<i>Lord of Alcandria: Chapter II</i> begins in an empty graveyard in the middle of the night. Suddenly a burst of magical sparkles appears, then disappears, above one of the gravestones. A moment later, a gray hand pushes up through the earth...<br><br>In this fantasy point &amp; click adventure game, you take on the role of the reanimated corpse of Krilok Rainwood, 13th century warrior. Your first task is find out who just performed your resurrection, and what they have planned for you.<br><br>The interface splits the screen vertically, where the top half of the screen shows the current scene from a third-person perspective, and underneath is a panel that lists the inventory items you are carrying as well as nine action buttons (&quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;Look at&quot;, &quot;Talk to&quot;, &quot;Use&quot;, &quot;Give&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Close&quot;, &quot;Push&quot; and &quot;Pull&quot;). Left-clicking the mouse is used to select an action button or an inventory item, and also used on the scene to direct the main character to walk towards the clicked point. Right-clicking is used to perform an action on a scene object or character. There are 10 savegame slots that you can save to by holding down the shift key and pressing one of the function keys F1-10, and later load from by pressing the same function key without holding down shift.",
