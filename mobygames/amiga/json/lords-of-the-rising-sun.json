  "description": "Japan, 12th century. After your father has been murdered, you set out on a quest to become Shogun to restore the honor of your family.<br><br>You'll have to defeat all your enemies - including your brother.<br><br>Most of the time, you'll move your troops through the big map of Japan - as soon as something happens, you'll have to fight your enemies in action sequences, such as a Gauntlet-like fortress attack or defending against a Ninja assassin. If two troops collide, a battle might ensue in which you'll have to use all your strategical wits to guide your men to victory.<br><br>In the CD-i version the informative sequences include life actor FMVs and voice acting as well as new background art.",
