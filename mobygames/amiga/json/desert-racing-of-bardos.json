  "description": "The desert planet of BarDos is not a friendly planet, but that is exactly why it is sought out by some of the most crazy racing maniacs of the galaxy. They fly their racing cars there to run in a contest with few rules, where even use of weapons is allowed for reaching pole position.<br><br><i>Desert Racing of BarDos</i> is the Amiga's first 3D racer where the landscape is a voxel landscape, a method that is perfect for creating soft hills and valleys. The car is also in 3D, and the camera has a lot of options for zoom, tracking and angle. Between the courses, players can upgrade their cars with new weapons and parts using their prize money. A lot of pre-rendered cut scenes are shown between each menu and setup. As a single player, you can choose to compete in the entire season or just run in single races. Two players can compete in a split-screen mode.",
