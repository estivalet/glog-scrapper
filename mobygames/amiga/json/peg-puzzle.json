  "description": "<i>Peg Puzzle</i> is an implementation of the classic &quot;Towers of Hanoi, where a pyramid of six discs must be moved from one peg to another on a board with three pegs. Only smaller discs may be stacked on larger discs, hence a lot of shuffling is required. Unlike many other variations, this game uses fast graphics and sampled sound effects for moving the discs with the mouse pointer.",
