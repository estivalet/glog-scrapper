  "description": "<i>Legend of Lothian</i> is a public domain RPG heavily inspired by the <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ultima\">Ultima</a></i> series. As it happens, Lothian, king of Mercia, has been put under a spell, putting him to sleep indefinitely. As the king no longer can fulfill his duties, the land of Mercia is is close to ruin. The army is falling apart so that orcs roam the land freely, and trade can't go on. One day, you, a poor shepherd, is contacted in a dream by a magician who tells you that you must awake the king and save the kingdom, giving you an enchanted stone. Thus, you set out on your quest.<br><br><i>LoL</i> plays like a traditional <i>Ultima</i>, even (subconsciously) using a similar EGA-like palette and simple outlines for characters. Control is via keyboard, with a lot of one-key commands to trade, enter towns, engage in combat and so forth. Alternatively, the mouse can be used to move around and engage in actions via icons at the bottom of the screen. You have a system of experience points, weapons and armour, and enemies drop gold if defeated. Combat is turn-based and gives you two options per turn: fight or flee. Your supply of food must be managed, or you starve quickly, as each move consumes a set amount of food. You regenerate your health automatically, or do it quickly by visiting a healer. The game progresses through a combination of interrogation of characters in towns and exploration of the map.",
