  "description": "The character Baron Baldric is quite known among Apogee fans for his appearance in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mystic-towers\">Mystic Towers</a>, but the Baron had earlier appeared in this side-scrolling game. It is considered very rare since the registered version was only sold in the Australian territory.<br><br>The story behind <i>Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure</i> takes place under Castle Pedabouch. You have to search for the family treasures in the tomb: it was told that, centuries before, Baron Baldric's ancestor, Baron Lazarus Pedabouche studied an evil Wolf-Magic and turned into a cruel tyrant: fortunately, when he seized Rosie, a local milk-maid, he was stoned to death by his own subjects. Rosie died too, and was doomed to haunt the whole castle until the ancient baron was slain.<br><br>The game is somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/impossible-mission-ii\">Impossible Mission 2</a> and the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=073000094607\">Montezuma's Revenge</a> because of many elements bringing the game far from the action genre. You have to find flints to light lamps when they go out, and regularly eat food to survive the maze.",
