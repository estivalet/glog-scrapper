  "description": "<i>Superleague Soccer</i> is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player is responsible for the athletic and financial success of a soccer team. As usually, most of the game is menu-based and consists of tinkering with adjusting screws. Examples for possible activities are the transfer market, athlete line-up or tactics. Each athlete has a data sheet in which information like statistics, value or the career can be checked. A speciality is the match presentation: besides watching just the highlights, the player may also choose to see the whole match. Then individual instructions to each athlete can be given: when the player clicks on an athlete, he stands still until the player clicks on the place he should go.",
