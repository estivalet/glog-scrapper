  "description": "Eskel and Sogrom are the greatest magicians in the land, and both are hungry for power. The long war between them is beginning to enter Endgame, in the Rochebrume cluster of 23 islands, each with their own special range of magic on offer.<br><br>The game is highly strategic, with icon-based controls and a turn-based structure similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/battle-isle\">Battle Isle</a>. You will need to destroy the rival wizard's forces on each island. It's important to hold as many castles as possible, so as to generate the maximum amount of magic. Magic is used to move and create your forces, and to weaken your opposition.",
