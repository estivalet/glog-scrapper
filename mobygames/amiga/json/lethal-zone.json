  "description": "<i>Lethal Zone</i> is a German horizontal shooter in the same vein as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=R-Type\">R-Type</a> series of games. You control a spaceship and you shoot enemy ships and obstacles, while avoiding projectiles and crashing on any surface. Holding the fire button and releasing it increases the power of your shots, while hitting it repeatedly lets out a stream of them. The destroyed enemies occasionally leave behind power-ups that can be collected. They increase and modify the power of your shots. You start with 5 lives, and at each 50.000 points you receive an extra one. The games has four levels, each with a unique &quot;boss&quot; enemy at the end.",
