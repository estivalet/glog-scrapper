  "description": "An updated 16-bit version of Codemasters' <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Grand+Prix+Simulator\">Grand Prix Simulator</a>. As before, the basic gameplay resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-sprint\">Super Sprint</a>, with an overhead view of simple tracks incorporating hairpins, oil slicks and underpasses.<br><br>The game now features 4 modes of play - Formula 1 cars, motorbikes, drag racers, and a mode featuring a variety of vehicles. These include those 3 as well as police cars, go-karts and a tank, which is too slow to be competitive but allows you to shoot out the other cars, and can be a blockade as you try to lap it.<br><br>Up to 6 cars can be featured in each race, and you can race over 3,4 or 5 laps. Four human players are supported, 2 on joysticks and 2 on keyboard",
