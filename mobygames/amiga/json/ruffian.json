  "description": "A platform adventure played across 17 levels, starring one of the younger videogame characters you’ll see. The game scrolls in multiple directions, although you are mostly progressing vertically, with levels designed so that one slip can see you falling a long way – this is similar to Rainbow Islands, but the levels are considerably longer, and it happens right from level one, making it more significant. Hits with the bad guys cause your percentage of energy to deplete. Each level is time-limited, and you get continues as well as lives. There is an surveillance element to positioning, with characters often camouflaging themselves behind backgrounds, and it being possible to use hills to hide, and get to attack creatures that would otherwise be much tougher foes.
