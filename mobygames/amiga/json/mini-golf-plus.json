  "description": "<i>Mini Golf Plus</i> is a mini golf game with 18 holes. The course is based on a real mini golf location, but features a few additional gimmicks like a crocodile which tries to snatch the ball. The game is controlled with the mouse: for every hit, the player sets the direction by putting a cursor somewhere on the course. However, this is only viable in a certain radius around the ball. The hit is performed with the left mouse button and the strength depends on how long it is hold. The main playing window is in a top-down perspective, but there's also a smaller window with a 3D perspective for better orientation.",
