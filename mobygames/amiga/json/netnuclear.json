  "description": "NetNuclear is an unofficial remake of the classical <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Nuclear+War\">Nuclear War</a>. NetNuclear not only offers the possibility of multiplayer matches, but also extends the game to other platforms, like Linux and Macintosh. Since the source code has been released, the remake can be ported into any other system that complies with certain technological requirements.<br><br>The game itself hasn't changed at all. The concept is still the same: to blow all opponents into stone age. Following the same premise, the AI is still random, featuring the same mocking events like the cow catapult bombing.<br><br>The TCP/IP supports up to five players, adding AI opponents to the vacant seats, since the game requires  each to face four foes.",
