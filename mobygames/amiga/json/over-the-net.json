  "description": "In <i>Over the Net</i> you can play Volleyball matches lasting 1, 3 or 5 sets, with each set being won by the first player to reach 15 points. Teams include the Rollers, CoCo, the Beach Boys (obvious pun in their name) and the in-house Geniases. The action is viewed from the side, with the full court visible. When fire is not pressed, joystick motions move your player in this direction; when it is, they attempt to hit the ball in that direction. As in real volleyball, the ball hitting the ground on your side of the net, or going out of bounds without bouncing, costs you a point.",
