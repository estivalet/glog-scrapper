  "description": "<i>Ortos</i> is an educational game for kids for up to ten players. The player's task is to choose the correct spelling of Polish words. The correct missing letter needs to be selected from two different choices indicated in the middle of the screen. The player has only few seconds to make a decision. The game underlines the missing letter of the word the player needs to decide on. The gameplay is introduced as a two-player duel, developed into a cup tree system for the higher number of players. The correct answer is awarded with a green token. The winner is the player who first reaches a fixed number of tokens. The tokens are set next to the time indicator (alarm clock). ",
