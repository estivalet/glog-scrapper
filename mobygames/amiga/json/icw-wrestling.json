  "description": "<i>ICW Wrestling</i> is a wrestling game with four fictional wrestlers: Lance DoGood, Ivan Trotsky, Kai-Leung Kahn and &quot;The Bruiser&quot;. The former three can be chosen as playing character and the goal is to win in a three-fight competition, &quot;The Bruiser&quot; being the final fight. The game features various moves which are also used in real wrestling. Which one is used depends on the joystick movements as well as the set mode: either boxing and wrestling. The former has standard moves and is used to bring the opponent's energy down. Then he is suitable to try a wrestling move, e.g. a Suplex or a PowerSlam. ",
