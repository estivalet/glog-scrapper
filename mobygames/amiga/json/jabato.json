  "description": "<i>Jabato</i> is an adventure composed of six parts, each one with its own independent argument, but subtly related to the main plot. In each geographic area you will have different problems, interlaced within a series of &quot;custom pictures&quot; which gather part of Europe and North  Africa as they were in the first century BC. It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in the fight against the evil but with a great heart. In this history you will assume the role of this fabulous personage. <br><br>But it won't be easy: instead of living one of his moments of greatness, you will incarnate a defeated Jabato, without friends, prisoner in a dirty Roman jail with the bitter feeling that his beloved Claudia is captive in a distant land. Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries. If you survive, you will fight the final battle against the terrible forces of the dark wisdom.",
