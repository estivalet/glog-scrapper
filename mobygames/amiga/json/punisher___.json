  "description": "In <i>The Punisher</i>, the player takes control over the Marvel comic hero The Punisher. His goal in this game: eradicating the gang The Trust. Each level consists of a series of single screens in which The Punisher needs to kill all enemies before they can deplete the Punisher's health resources. This is done by moving the crosshairs over the bad guys and firing the weapon of choice. However, shooting an innocent results in instant game over.<br><br>Between levels, the player has the choice which main weapon to bring into the fight. There are five available, e.g. a machine gun, a pulse gun or flame thrower. Additionally he will bring a secondary gun (colt) and some grenades into the level. Ammo is limited.",
