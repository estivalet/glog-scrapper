  "description": "Toobz is a puzzle game involving coloured spheres, which are variously red, blue, green and yellow. They are fired into a level from various starting points, along a selection of tubes (or 'toobz'), and the aim is to guide them into finishing points of the correct colour. This is done using various rotation points, which can be turned so as to redirect each ball. If it hits the end of the point (with it not set to recieve a ball) it goes straight back where it came from. <br><br>The levels also include machines which recieve a ball and change its colour, in accordance with a pre-defined sequence.<br><br>After each finishing point recieves a ball, its target colour changes at random, so be careful of setting it up to recieve multiple balls in one go.<br><br>Points are awarded based on how much time you have left after getting the required number of balls across. Time is lost for each ball of the wrong colour that reaches the end - running out of time costs you one of your 3 lives",
