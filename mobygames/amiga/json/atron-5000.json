  "description": "<i>Atron 5000</i> is a light cycle game for two players or one player against an AI driver. The game is played in split screen where player one has the top part of the screen while the AI or player two has the bottom part. Like in other games of its kind the player races a bike that leaves a trail behind and the objective is to stay alive longer than the opponent by not crashing into any walls, obstacles or the trails of either bike. The game consists of twelve levels and a single match goes through all of them. Each level is played twice except for the last one which is played three times.<br><br>Some power ups can be picked up and then activated. They are either red or yellow and the colours correspond with the colours of the bikes and when activated only the bike with the right colour is affected. There are four different ones: bombs that erase the bike's trail, S's that speed up the bike, M's that can blow a hole in a trail and W's that construct a wall in front of the opponent. ",
