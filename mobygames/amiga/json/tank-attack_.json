  "description": "<i>Tank Attack</i> is a public domain game for up to four players. <br><br>Each player controls a round tank which they manoeuvre around a play area which has scattered obstacles that provide cover. Naturally, for a game with the word 'Tank' in its title, the player's vehicle is equipped with a big gun. The good news is that shells from the gun can be made to bounce off the walls and obstacles. The bad news is that the gun can overheat at which point it stops working so the player must run, hide and dodge until it cools down enough to work again.<br>The objective is to destroy the other player's tanks before being destroyed themselves.<br><br>Power-ups appear randomly throughout the levels however they all look the same so no-one has any idea whether they will be beneficial or useful. <br><br>The game is joystick or keyboard controlled. There is no single player vs the computer option.\n",
