  "description": "Starbase 13 is a sci-fi point &amp; click adventure game for the Amiga, created in AMOS. It uses a LucasArts-style action bar with seven actions: &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;Examine&quot;, &quot;Operate&quot;, &quot;Use&quot;, &quot;Take&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot; and &quot;Shoot&quot;. &quot;Use&quot; and &quot;Operate&quot; are separate because &quot;Use&quot; always involves two objects as in &quot;Use (...) with (...)&quot;, while the &quot;Operate&quot; action always involves one object. There are five save game slots that you can save to using keys F6-F10, and load from with keys F1-F5. Starbase 13's pathfinding algorithm is a little temperamental, and sometimes you may need to manually guide the character around obstacles by clicking several points along the way.<br><br>The hero of the game is Yeno Hou, a member of the crew on the Starship 8.3. In the introduction, he is summoned by the captain and given a mission to investigate a space station that has been broadcasting a distress signal.<br><br>Unlike in some graphic adventures, it is possible to die in Starbase 13, and some parts require quick reflexes to succeed.<br><br>Starbase 13 was followed by a sequel in 1995, titled &quot;Epsilon 9: Revenge of the Stingons&quot;.",
