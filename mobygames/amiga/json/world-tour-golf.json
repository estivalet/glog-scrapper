  "description": "<i>World Tour Golf</i> lets you play over a dozen well known courses, including Augusta and Pebble Beach. A split screen gives you an overhead view of the hole and a 3-D view. The control uses multiple button presses to set pace and draw/fade - fortunately a Driving Range is included to practice on. When you select a club, its range is superimposed on the view, making planning shots easier. Wind, pin placement and even weather conditions must be considered as you play your shot.  Also included is a course architect for creating new courses or modifying existing ones.",
