  "description": "<i>Tom &amp; Jerry</i> is a platformer based on the two cartoon animals. The player takes the role of Jerry who has to navigate the five levels while collecting every piece of cheese. Besides the usual platforming obstacles there is a time limit and Tom who tries to catch Jerry. The player needs to avoid Tom but can also use the environment to get rid of him temporarily: a bowling ball on the head knocks him out or a prepared floor lets him slip. \nThe main levels are side-scrolling, but between each level the game switches to a behind-the-shoulder perspective. Then Jerry has to run through a tunnel while collecting cheese and avoiding dynamite or bombs.",
