  "description": "Tail Tale is a cutesy puzzler, basically a version of &quot;connect four&quot; without the diagonal connects. The window is filled with several rows of coloured bricks, which obscures the background where an animated girl resides. You can move any of the bricks around, with the goal of making a constellation where four or more bricks of the same colour are connected in a row or column, whereupon they disappear. After a while, new rows of bricks are pushed up into the playfield, and just like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> and other games, the game is over when you don't manage to clear the playfield before a brick touches the upper part of the screen. As the game progresses, Midori, as the girl in the background is called, changes clothes, which serves as a reward for the player – A bit like strip poker, but without the stripping and the poker.",
