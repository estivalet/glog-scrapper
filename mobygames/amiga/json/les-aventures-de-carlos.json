  "description": "You are <i>Carlos</i>, a fat man wearing a black beard and bright coverall. You start your travels accompanied by a parrot in the jungles full of animals. During the game you should jump your way through 5 different levels full of different inhabitants (such as clowns, rats, monkeys, golf-players, etc.), climbing the ladders, entering the passageways to teleport to another locations, using the supporting devices (such as powder kegs to jump higher), collecting the different kinds of useful items from the chests, killing the enemies jumping over them,  blowing them away summoning the limited amount of whirlwinds in the visible area, or morphing to the bull for limited amount of times. The parrot is flying over you and helping you to eliminate the flying enemies. On each level you have to gather the keys to open the gates, push some switches or levers, and collect certain items for some kind of picture.<br><br>To return to a certain level you should enter the proper password. The best scores are stored in a High Score Table.",
