  "description": "Bratwurst is a two-player cave-flyer like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gravity-force-2\">GF2</a>, but with a twist. Instead of using a fixed perspective with bitmap graphics, it uses vector graphics. This means that the playfield may be zoomed into and out of, which is used in order to display both ships on screen at all times without resorting to split-screen mode. When the ships are far from each other, the scene is viewed from afar, and when they are close to each other the &quot;camera&quot; zooms in so that only the relevant portion of the game is on-screen.<br><br>Bratwurst features a range of ships, inspired by science fiction and comics, and a range of special weapons for each ship in addition to the main cannon. It differs from most other games of the genre by supporting four simultaneous players via a four-player adaptor.<br><br>The game was first released on the Compusphere IV demo party.",
