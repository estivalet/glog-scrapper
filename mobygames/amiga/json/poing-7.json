  "description": "The last instalment in the <i>Poing</i> series sums up the entire series by combining the latest version of the unorthodox <i>Breakout</i> engine with levels from several of the earlier games as well as third-party level packs. <br><br>As usual, in this horizontally oriented <i>Breakout</i>, it is your task to bounce a ball on the right wall. After hitting the wall ten times, it opens and your ball reaches the next level. If you miss the ball, it comes back at a blazing speed through previous levels, giving you at least some kind of chance to pick it up instead of losing it immediately. If the ball is too fast, and your power level too high, which often is the case if the ball has been in play for a long time, it may momentarily destroy your paddle.<br><br>There is a plethora of blocks, from the basic ones with varying levels of hardness to those that expand into four blocks, crystals that give bonus points, magnetic blocks, deflecting blocks, pinball-like bumper blocks, holding blocks which temporarily hold your ball and then release it at speed, etcetera. Destroying an entire group of blocks usually makes it reappear in a new guise, with new effects, usually releasing a group of bonus crystals as well. Likewise, there are many bonus blocks such as slow-downs, multi-ball, bonus multipliers, dancing vector bonuses, autopilot, gravity and much more.",
