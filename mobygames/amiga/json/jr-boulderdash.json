  "description": "<i>Jr-Boulderdash</i> is a minimalistic <i>Boulder Dash</i> clone. Your goal is to collect all the buried treasures on the screen, without being crushed by a boulder when you dislodge it from the soil. Unlike in many variants of <i>Boulder Dash</i>, once you have collected the final treasure, the level is over immediately -- you do not need to seek an exit as well. There is also no time limit, but you do have a limited number of lives. The game has no music and very simple sound effects.",
