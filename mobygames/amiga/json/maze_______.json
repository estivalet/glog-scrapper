  "description": "<i>The Maze</i> is a single player game in which the player starts at some point within a maze and must find their way out of it.<br><br>The game is played entirely with the mouse. The game area is divided into five areas, in the four corners are mini windows showing the views of the maze in front, behind, and to the left/right. The player moves around the maze either by clicking on a window or on one of the four arrow keys which in the centre of the screen. <br>There'a also an alternate view which shows the areas of the maze already explored<br><br>There is music with this game but there is no save function and no documentation so it is not known whether the player faces a new maze in each game. \n",
