  "description": "In <i>Wicked</i>, a big evil has come to the world and the player has to drive it back. To do so, the twelve astrological signs (with three levels each) have to be purged. The basic idea is that portals spit out spores which can be either good or evil. The goal is to produce enough good spores to overrun and destroy all evil portals before the screen is filled with bad spores. <br><br>The player has to manage the time resources because everything has to be done manually: shooting at the evil spore growth to drive it back and picking up good spores to create good spore portals at strategically useful positions. Additional gameplay elements are Guardians which fly around the screen and are unhealthy when touched, a night-time-rhythm which influence the spore growth and tarot cards which get revealed in regular intervals. These have either good or bad influences for the one who picks it up. There are three options to set the gameplay: action-oriented, strategy-oriented or mixed.",
