  "description": "<i>Genetic Species</i> is a first-person 3D shooter set in the grim 22nd century. Ruthless corporations dominate the world and only the CFA (Counter Force Alliance) dare oppose them. Upon entering the game, several corporate bases have been attacked by an unknown force and it's your mission to investigate these attacks. To do this, you play as a BioShifter, which is a unit capable of taking control of living creatures as well as cyborgs and droids via their electronic implants. The gameplay in Genetic Species is familiar and like most shooters, the emphasis is on action. Still, the game contains many original items and weapons, some of which are quite unique and allows you to tune down the killing.  ",
