  "description": "<i>Timekeepers: An elite police force, trying to protect the 4th dimension from terrorist attacks. 14 platoons are sent to 4 different time periods (2 million BC Belgium, 1245 Medieval Europe, 1966 Vietnam and 2001 Space). Their mission: to disarm nuclear bombs placed by a psychotic warlord.</i><br><br><b>Timekeepers</b> is hybrid strategy and puzzle game. It plays like a cross between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lemmings\">Lemmings</a> and a RTS like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dune-ii-the-building-of-a-dynasty\">Dune 2</a>. The main game screen has a row of icons at the bottom, timekeepers' portraits at each side and at the center a scrolling map of the level. The platoon is autonomous, the player can't control it directly but instead has to place icons on the map to order the troops. A soldier will try to perform an action while passing over an icon. The icons available are:<br><br><b>Directions arrows</b> - guide the trooper;<br><br><b>Clock</b> - stops the soldier for a while;<br><br><b>Foot imprint</b> - makes the timekeeper jump over something;<br><br><b>Wrench</b> - forces the trooper to operate some lever or switch;<br><br><b>Gaping mouth</b> - orders the soldier to attack;<br><br><b>ZZZ</b> - pauses the game;<br><br><b>Brain</b> - to choose earlier levels;<br><br><b>Diskette</b> - disk options, like saving and loading.<br><br>There's no limit of time or amount of icons that can be placed. The levels have booby traps, enemies and dangerous environments that can kill your timekeepers. There are 60 levels on 4 different time settings, each with their own graphics set. The main objective of each level is to reach the exit and teleport all your troops to the next map.",
