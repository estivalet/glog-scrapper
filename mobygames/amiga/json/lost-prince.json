  "description": "The Lost Prince is a fantasy point &amp; click graphic adventure for the Amiga, created in AMOS. The game has a LucasArts-style action bar with six mode buttons: &quot;Examine&quot;, &quot;Use&quot;, &quot;Use ... on&quot;, &quot;Take&quot;, &quot;Talk to&quot; and &quot;Options&quot;. Use the left mouse button to walk and to select action buttons, and the right mouse button to perform an action on a selected object or character. The pathfinding algorithm is imperfect, and sometimes you will need to guide the character manually around obstacles by clicking several points along the way.<br><br>The main character is young Prince Rindlepoke, who lived in a magnificent castle and liked to play the harp. One day he was kidnapped and taken away on a ship, but a sudden storm gave him the opportunity to escape. The game begins as he washes up alone on an unfamiliar beach. From here, there are a few places he can walk to: a cave near the top of a large hill, a dark grey stone castle with a moat, and several small businesses operating in the local village.<br><br>The Lost Prince was the second graphic adventure released by DTO Software, after &quot;Starbase 13&quot; (1993). The engine created for The Lost Prince later formed the basis of GR.A.C., an adventure game authoring system released in 1995.",
