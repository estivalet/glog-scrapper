  "description": "Cho is a young farmer who travels the world in search of adventure, fame, and fortune. He is asked by the king to find out the whereabouts of the evil prince Gallus, overpower him, and bring him back to the king to serve his punishment for burning down the palace and murdering Kane the previous day. If Cho succeeds in his quest, the king will hand the throne over to him. Unfortunately, Cho doesn't have anything to start off with, so he must find some weapons and protection before he starts.<br><br>Your quest begins in Sharma City, where the palace resides. You can talk to people to get some hints on what to do and where to go. Along the way you may find some weapons that can be found hidden in treasure cheats or are given to Cho. Some of these weapons include swords for killing enemies, and bombs for blowing up obstacles that get in your way. Some locations have teleports (one-way only) that will get you from one place to another, and you can reveal any hidden items by shooting any flora. ",
