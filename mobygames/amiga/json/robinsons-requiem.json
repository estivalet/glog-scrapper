  "description": "In the far future humanity has achieved faster-than-light space travel, but the galaxy is still a big unknown place. To chart the stars and planets explorers named &quot;Robinsons&quot; are sent on scouting tours of duty. Most of the time the Robinsons sent away are individuals deemed dangerous to society and whose ships are sabotaged.<br><br>You play one of these Robinsons who gets stranded on a mysterious alien planet on which a telepathic woman is also stranded. As it turns out she knows a way to get off the planet, but she needs your help to escape.<br><br>Gameplay consists of first person roleplaying with the emphasis placed on character modeling and survival. Take a dip when it's cold and you'll sure catch the flu, don't treat an infected injury and amputation is on the way, etc. You must fashion your own tools from whatever you can find on the planet and the game uses pre-rendered sprites over voxel technology terrain for graphics.",
