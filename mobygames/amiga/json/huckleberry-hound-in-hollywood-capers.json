Different obstacles such as lethal drops, flying balls, sticky, icy, or moving ground, teleports, inhabitants of the four Worlds, etc. are present on your way, and your jumping skill allows you to avoid them. Your take is finished if you lose your current bone energy. <br><br>The player's highest score will be stored. After completing the game once you may replay it again, but the gameplay will be harder.
