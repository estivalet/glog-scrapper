  "description": "<i>Sky Cabbie</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Taxi\">Space Taxi</a> variant. The player takes the role of a taxi driver who has to transport passengers from one part of the 24 one-screen levels to another. The faster the player is, the more points are received - the goal is to get as many as possible within a time limit. The levels itself consist of platforms along with obstacles like narrow passages or an active volcano. However, the main challenge are the controls: similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/thrust\">Thrust</a> the taxi is effected by gravity and needs attuned control inputs in order to avoid crashing into the environment. There is also only a limited amount of fuel available.",
