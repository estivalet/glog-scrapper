It's their job to rid the planet of the attacking aliens. <br><br>Guiding your character around the screen as they fly with jet-packs, guns on full auto, you control a satellite which you rotate around your character for the direction in which your gun is firing. At the end of each level is a boss which needs to be killed to progress.<br><br>Enemies that have been killed drop money. At the end of every level is a shop where you can buy weapons, armour, items and first-aid packs.",
