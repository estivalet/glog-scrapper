  "description": "In <i>Spinworld</i> the player takes control of a two-man space ship, manned by Ronald and Joe, which is sent out to explore the the planet Spinworld. The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player has to shoot everything that moves and must avoid touching the environment. It is not advised to use rapid fire, though, because the gun may overheat. A speciality is the fuel which needs to be replenished before running out. To do so the player needs to shoot enemies until &quot;crunch&quot; is activated which can be converted to fuel in the so-called &quot;tunnels&quot;. There are seven levels.",
