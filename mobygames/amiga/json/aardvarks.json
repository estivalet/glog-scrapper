  "description": "<i>Aardvarks</i> is a <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lemmings\">Lemmings</a></i> clone that also pays tribute to the TV series <i>The Raccoons</i> and <i>Doctor Who</i>. As in <i>Lemmings</i>, the goal in each level is to guide a number of small creatures (pink aardvarks, based on the design of <i>Raccoons</i> character Cyril Sneer) that fall onto the level from a mid-air entrypoint (in this case, a UFO) over to the exit point (a blue booth with a light on the top, which closes up and disappears with a sci-fi sound effect at the end of the level). To do this you will need to assign some of the creatures skills (exploding, blocking, building, horizontal digging and vertical digging) that allow them to alter the terrain, bypass obstacles and avoid danger. Otherwise, the creatures will walk continuously forward until they either fall off an edge, or hit a wall and start walking back the other way. The game is mouse-controlled: you first click on a button representing one of the five skills, and then click on one of the creatures to assign that skill. Each level has a limited number of each skill that can be used, and a time limit. The interface uses red and green bars to display how many of each skill is still available, how many creatures still need to be saved, and how much time there is left.",
