  "description": "<em>Federation of Free Traders</em> is a space simulation/exploration game that is quite similar to an earlier title, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Elite\">Elite</a>. The player is able to zoom around in space while trading goods, undertake missions, or simply explore the galaxy (which consists of over 8 million planets). <br><br>There is a significant amount of playable options in <em>FOFT</em> and a considerable attention is paid to detail. For instance, if the player becomes tired of roaming through outer space they skim a planet or two (which plays in a similar fashion to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1003/\">David Braben's</a> other game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/virus__\">Virus</a>).<br><br>During the docking sequence players can create their own programs for automated functions, using a built-in BASIC like language called SIMPLE.
