  "description": "<i>P.O.W.</i> is the second light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga similar in style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a>. The premise is to rescue a group of trapped US soldiers from hostile territory.<br><br>The game takes place in following locations and terrains: jungle, bridge, village, armory, swamp, radio tower, prison camp and beach. Armed with your machine gun and a few rockets you must shoot enemy soldiers and vehicles (tanks, helicopters, submarines) while avoiding the innocent bystanders. You can also shoot bonus icons that include additional ammo and health.<br><br>The screen is scrolling sideways and play became faster as the game progress. There are three levels of difficulty and three corresponding maps a player could follow.",
