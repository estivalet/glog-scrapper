  "description": "<i>Get Out</i> is a top-down Breakout clone with highly polished graphics. The gameplay is orthodox, with the only addition being the ten powerups dropped from destroyed bricks, and the usual kinds of &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; bricks, the latter requiring several hits to be destroyed. Certain blocks are even indestructible. The powerups are: Fast ball, slow ball, bonus points, extra life, smaller bat, bigger bat, double balls, smart bomb and reverse controls.<br><br><i>Get Out</i> has 16 levels, and has a polished, demo scene-ish graphical look (not surprising, since at least one of the creators is a member of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Oxyron\">Oxyron</a>). Though it runs on all Amigas, only those with AGA machines get to see the 3-D animated intro.",
