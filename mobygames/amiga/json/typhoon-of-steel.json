  "description": "<i>Typhoon of Steel</i> is a tactical level simulation of small unit actions during WWII. It is a sequel to the best selling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Panzer+Strike\">Panzer Strike</a> and the rules are very similar. Three theaters are covered: the Pacific Theater (Americans vs Japanese), the Asian Theater (British vs Japanese) and European Theater action involving American vs German troops. <br><br><i>Typhoon of Steel</i> includes practically every ground weapon used by the combatants in this theater (over 220 weapon types). Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. <br><br>The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like <i>Panzer Strike</i>, the gameplay is considered to be advanced level.",
