  "description": "Just because a region is bleak, desolate and inhospitable doesn't mean it lacks value. The planet Colian is a case in point; it has plentiful stocks of tough metal Aluma, the explosive Detonite, and the energy giving Quaza crystals. The units which are mining them are under the control of the Empire, and are forced to produce destructive Terrorpod units.<br><br>The rival Federation attempts to shut this operation down, and sends you to the surface in a Defence Strategy Vehicle. Your task is to find each of the six bases before the Empire can destroy evidence of them. Destroy all the <i>Terrorpods</i> in order to reach the bases.<br><br>The action is viewed from your DSV, as you move and shoot at any encroaching Terrorpods. Colian has a heavy inertia field, so you are always moving. You have guided missiles at your disposal, although these use up some of your limited Detonite stocks. Missiles will also be aimed at you; avoid these.<br><br>As all this action unfolds, you are trying to ensure that enough components can be produced in the mines, and can be retrieved in order to go towards the Federation's own building efforts. Collect the resultant products to attach them to your DSV.",
