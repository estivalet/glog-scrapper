  "description": "<i>Brain Challenge: The Arena of Death</i> is a strategy game with strong similarities to the board game <i>Stratego</i>. The background story is about an evil lord who has to driven out of his castle. Each player has 24 playing stones with different ranks which are divided over the own half of a chess board. In each round the player can move one stone with the goal to conquer the stationary palace (represented by a flag). However, the main catch is that the ranks of each enemy's stone is hidden until it gets attacked. During an attack, the higher rank always wins. If both have the same rank, both lose. Additionally every player has also stationary bombs which are always deadly when attacked.",
