  "description": "<i>Janosik</i> is an enhanced port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/janosik_\">Atari game of the same title</a>. Graphics and audio aspects were adapted to the 16-bit computers, boards entirely remodeled. The game introduced some new elements, like animated short scenes or new types of obstacles.<br><br>The game world is divided into forest, village and castle areas. Armed with a shepherd's axe and precise jumping ability Janosik must defeat all the enemies to free Maryna.<br><br>This platform game is loosely based on the story around Juraj Jánošík, a XVII / XVIIIc. Slovak highlander, leader of Carpathian brigands. In Poland the legend was revived by a popular TV series from 1970s, making him a fictional XIXc. gallant folk hero, who only robs the rich Austrian nobles to help oppressed local peasants, &quot;Robin Hood way&quot;.",
