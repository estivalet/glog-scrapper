  "description": "The oddly-named <i>Moebius Goatlizard</i> is a conversion of the SAM Coupé game <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lost-disks-of-sam\">Lost Disks of SAM</a></i>, itself a conversion of the ZX Spectrum game <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lost-tapes-of-albion\">Lost Tapes of Albion</a></i>.<br><br>The eponymous Moebius Goatlizard loves collecting useless things, and after completing his collection of lost Speccy tapes and never-released SAM floppies, he's heading to collect a lot of randomly generated 8-bit &quot;space invaders&quot; aliens.<br><br>A single screen platform game, <i>Moebius</i> has you running around on eight floors from top to bottom, filled with the small pixel aliens. The floors are connected to the left and right, so that running off-screen to the right puts you on the left of the platform below, or on the top platform if you happen to be on the bottom floor. Most of the time, though, it is better to use the teleport platforms interspersed throughot the floors, where you push up or down to move to the platform below or above. This is needed in order to avoid the nasties patrolling each floor, ranging from the mindless Chomper to the robotic Homer which turns your way whenever you're on the same platform, or the mindless but very speedy Pucky. If Moebius is in trouble, he can activate &quot;hyperspace&quot; to be transported to a random spot on the screen. He can only do this three times, though, unless he picks up hyperspace powerups. There are also powerups to stop the enemies in their tracks, to speed up Moebius or for limited invulnerability.<br><br><i>Moebius Goatlizard</i> is a quick arcade game, even on the easiest setting, and can be played by one or two players simultaneously.",
