  "description": "<i>Bograts: The Puzzling Misadventure</i> is a side-view puzzle game involving indirect control, although unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/lemmings\">Lemmings</a>, the player controls a parent Bograt who must guide the red and blue baby Bograts through each of 100 levels. This is done by clearing a path through the level for them to progress along.<br><br>Hazards include spikes, roaming enemies, trap doors, and ladders. Many levers are provided which will change the position of some of these hazards. The standard view focuses on the parent Bograt, but a mode exists to split the screen so as to allow one child to be viewed at the same time. The Bograts have different abilities and attributes, which can work both for and against the player. Vulcan have used the <i>Lemmings 2</i> system of a game-save system rather than <i>Lemmings 1</i> passwords.",
