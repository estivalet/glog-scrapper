  "description": "<i>Transworld</i> is a business simulation where you play a young entrepreneur in the carrying business. You start off with a capital of 50.000 DM and a small firm in Frankfurt am Main with the goal of building a business empire.<br><br>Apart from managing the delivery of a variety of goods (ranging from oil to food and vehicles), you can also try to increase your wealth by operating at the stock exchange or evading taxes. There are also several other aspects to consider: Too much work will increase your stress level, and if you do not take enough vacations, you will fall ill with corresponding negative effects on your enterprise. Furthermore, the game evaluates your play in three categories (success in business, prestige and trade relations), and winning the game requires a certain number of points in each category.",
