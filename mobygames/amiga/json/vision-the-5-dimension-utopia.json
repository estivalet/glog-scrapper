  "description": "<i>Vision: The 5th Dimension Utopia</i> is an advertising game for the German building society LBS, which sold it rather cheaply in its branches. The setting is an arcology floating on the sea. You are a new citizen in this city and you've got to work in order to make money for food and the rent of your suite while staying healthy through sleeping and eating enough. The common way to earn money is playing mostly action-oriented mini-games or doing smaller quests (or rather tasks), which also are part of the plot of the game.",
