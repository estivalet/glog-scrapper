  "description": "You are Ensign Bren, on a mission to investigate a communications blackout at Base DS97 on the planet Thalax 9. From the outside, everything looks normal -- everything operational, no damage to the base structure -- and yet you can't shake the feeling that something just isn't right. After donning your life support equipment and leaving your scout shuttle, you enter your access code and enter the lift that brings you into the facility. As you descend, a bad feeling creeps onto you ...<br><br><i>Black Dawn: Rebirth</i> is the seventh game in the <i>Black Dawn</i> series of horror sci-fi dungeon crawlers for the Amiga, similar in play style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dungeon-master\">Dungeon Master</a> but with the atmosphere of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=DOOM\">DOOM</a>. As a hapless ensign, you must find out what happened at Base DS97 and survive by investigating the various levels of the facility, arming yourself and defending against the things that shouldn't be there.",
