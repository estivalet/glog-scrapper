  "description": "<i>Shuffle</i> is a successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atomix\">Atomix</a> and offers the same playing principle: the player has to construct a molecule by combining atoms. Those atoms are spread out over the top-down playfield and can be moved by walking into them with the player character. Once nudged, the atoms don't stop until they meet a wall or another obstacle. All this has to be achieved within a time limit. Also included is the two-player mode known from the predecessor: both players work at the same puzzle, but only the one who finished it gets the points. The players take turns of ten seconds.<br><br>The main addition to the gameplay mechanics are power ups which can be collected in the levels, e.g. extra time, bonus points or a level skip. The game features 30 regular levels and all five levels the player has the opportunity to improve the high score by playing a bonus level. In addition there are 35 levels which are designed for advanced players.",
