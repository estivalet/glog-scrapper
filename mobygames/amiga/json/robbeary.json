  "description": "In <i>Robbeary</i> the player takes the role of Berrie Bear, a successful criminal. And a bear, hence the title. His current mission: robbing the local store with 24 levels.<br><br>This game is a traditional one-screen platformer where the player navigates platforms by jumping over gaps and using ladders. The goal is to collect all fruits on a screen without touching the patrolling monsters. There are various extras to collect which have effects like turning the enemies into diamonds or faster movement speed. However, when the player takes too long for a level, the enemies mutate into much faster versions of themselves. Falling into the holes at the bottom of the screen causes the player to fall down from corresponding holes on the top.",
