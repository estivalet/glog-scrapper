  "description": "How do you make an interesting computer game out of the venerable Rubik's Cube concept? According to cult programmer Tobias Richter, you view it from the top with all sides displayed, and allow the player to choose the number of sides, from 4 to 25.<br><br>A large number of different starting arrangements are offered, grouped by difficulty. Rather than having a level-based progression, you can choose any of these from the start. A number of different tunes are provided, written by Team 17 cohort Bjørn Lynne.",
