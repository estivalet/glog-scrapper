  "description": "Rescuing girlfriends is a pretty common challenge in older computer games - why can't any of these ladies look after themselves? On this occasion Pearly has been kidnapped by Fransz Dandruff, so better make sure he's <i>hair</i> today, gone tomorrow.<br><br>The gameplay is platform based, although the player may move down platforms as well as up to the next one. There are lots of baddies (drawn in a cutesy style) who need shooting and offer rewards. The seven levels are fairly short and linear.",
