  "description": "<i>Cybersphere</i> is an arcade game that is fundamentally similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a>. The player controls a &quot;paddle&quot; that can move horizontally which is used to direct a bouncing ball to destroy &quot;bricks&quot; arranged in different patterns. Some bricks may take several hits to destroy, and often drop gems that add to the player's score if collected, or various power-ups, including a temporary floor that will prevent the ball from falling outside the playing field, an extra ball, a wider paddle or cannons that the player may use to destroy more bricks.<br><br>The game does not feature any kind of plot. The levels are broken down into several &quot;sectors&quot;, with only the first one available in the demo version. In addition to regular levels, there are bonus stages that may be accessed by picking a certain bonus item during play.",
