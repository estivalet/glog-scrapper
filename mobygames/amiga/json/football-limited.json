  "description": "Bundesliga Manager Hattrick is a German football (soccer) management simulation, the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bundesliga-manager-professional\">Bundesliga Manager Professional</a>. The player or players (up to four) take the reigns of their favourite teams and try to lead them to both sportive and economical success.<br><br>For example, you can take out loans, invest money in real estate, buy new players, send them to training camps, strike advertisement deals, expand your stadium, select training methods and decide upon tatics and formation.<br><br>The latter two can still be modified as required during matches which are presented in a new &quot;realitymode&quot;, one of bigger changes from previous installments of the series. Instead of just seeing a pre-calculated textual representation of the match, little pixelated player now move around the field and you can see where the ball is going and adopt your strategy accordingly.\n",
