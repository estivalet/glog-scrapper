  "description": "<i>Mad Bomber</i> is a fast game where you move a stack of buckets at the bottom of the screen to catch the bombs a mad bomber drops from the top. They need to be caught and extinguished in the buckets before they reach the ground. A bucket is removed when that happens until none are left. The game has a single-player mode and a two-player mode for both cooperative and competitive gameplay.<br><br>The game is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kaboom\">Kaboom!</a>",
