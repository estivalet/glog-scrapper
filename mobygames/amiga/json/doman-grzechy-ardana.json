  "description": "<i>Doman: Grzechy Ardana</i> (Doman: Ardan's Sins) is a brutal beat 'em up which tells the story of Doman, a Slavic response to the famous Conan, featured in a series of Polish comic books. Playing as Doman (or his buddy Baurus) you must end the tyranny of Ardan, fighting against his footmen, archers, mages and giant guards. You'll travel through forests, villages, shores and mountains, meeting NPCs, to finally reach Satan's Claw (Ardan's castle).<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to the likes of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Double+Dragon\">Double Dragon</a>: our protagonist heads relentlessly to the right, occasionally stopping to fight a group of more or less competent warriors who come at him. The gameplay and graphics style is similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=franko-the-crazy-revenge\">Franko</a>, but this time a multiplayer option is offered. This game has more moves and combos (e.g.: decapitation) that can be performed and features more weapons to choose from (sword, axe, mace etc.). The package also contains a storybook.",
