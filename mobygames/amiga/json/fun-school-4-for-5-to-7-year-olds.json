  "description": "Freddy the Frog presents six games designed to help school-starting children build on their numeracy and literacy skills. The rules for each game are explained in the form of short stories. Controls primarily use the cursor keys and enter.<br><br>Freddie is building a house, but can only add a log to his work if you solve a maths question. In the library, a list of book titles must be sorted into alphabetical order. <br><br>Successfully ordering letter and number sequences on the basketball court results in shots going in. Knowing which word is the opposite of the displayed one will help Freddy's diving.<br><br>In the shop you have to identify which coins pay for which items, and then total up a shopping load and work out which coins pay for it. There is also a simple typing test included.",
