  "description": "Damage is a violent game about the character Michael Modelcitizen. He was the perfect human who had everything but found out that it wasn’t enough, so he became crazy. You take control of Michael Modelcitizen and start the game with only a simple baseball bat inside his flat. Once outside you can walk around the huge city killing people (including old ladies and children), stealing better weapons and narcotics. By using different narcotics it is possible to enhance the strength of Michael’s body.<br><br>Watch out for the police and the military, they will try to stop you and don’t expect your baseball bat to make any impact on their equipment. If you are good enough maybe you will make it to the atom bomb in the end.",
