It is also a modern take on what made <strong>AMIGA</strong> games so great back in the days.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MEDIA ABOUT TOWER 57</strong></h2><i>&quot;(...) gorgeous artwork, action-packed gameplay and a seriously cool vibe.&quot;</i><br> - <strong>Hardcore Gamer</strong><br><br><i>&quot; 'Okay, so now you have to go over there and buy new legs,' the producer told me. Sold. I'm on board with this. Sometimes, it's the little things. <br>(...) Tower 57 could be the next great indie co-op game.&quot;</i><br> - <strong>WorthPlaying</strong><br><br><i>&quot;Tower 57 just wants to be a fun and crazy shooter for players, providing chaos and mayhem and crazy characters like Abe Lincoln with cyborg legs, and what’s a bullet hell shoot-em-up without a cyborg Abraham Lincoln?&quot;</i><br> - <strong>PlayStation LifeStyle</strong><br><br><i>&quot;(...) one of my most eagerly awaited games and a Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight success.&quot;</i><br> - <strong>IndieRetroNews</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FEATURES:</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAST-PACED ARCADE GAMEPLAY</h2><br><br>There is no school like the old school. <strong>Shoot everything that moves and don’t get killed in the process</strong>. Tower 57 offers complex situations arising from simple systems interacting with each other - and it does it the hard way. Number of lives is scarce, respawns limited and difficulty skyrockets when you least expect it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION</h2> <br>Choose from a roster of <strong>six particular characters with different skillsets, number of upgradable weapons and gadgets</strong>. And if you happen to lose an arm or leg during your mission - you can always replace it with a new, better one! Master these combos and you will never get bored on your way to the top of the Tower 57.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COOPERATION</h2><br>Mayhem tastes the best when it is shared. Tower 57's main campaign is designed for both, <strong>single player &amp; local/online CO-OP</strong>. Flank your enemies, bait them into an ambush, leverage co-op specific weapons, or combine your regular weapons for increased firepower and new effects!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DIESELPUNK WORLD</h2> <br>Find your way through a maze of floors connected by elevators, a central hub filled with shops and terminals, and a multitude of secret walls and uncharted passageways leading to forgotten parts of the tower. Times of randomly generated levels are gone - <strong>everything in Tower 57 is carefully designed and pixel-crafted with the highest attention to detail</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS</h2> <br>Smash them, crash them and destroy everything. Reload. Repeat. Because <strong>everyone likes when things go BOOM</strong>. Everything - from debris and shell casings to bloody footprints - will mark your destructive trail through the Tower.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADVERSARIES</h2> <br>Each enemy features its own distinct spawning mechanism, movement &amp; attack patterns, as well as some weaknesses. And you'd better <strong>learn those vulnerabilities if you don't want to end up dead very quick</strong>.",
