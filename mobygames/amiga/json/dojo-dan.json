  "description": "Control Dojo Dan through twenty massive multi-directional-scrolling levels of platforms, pickups and hand to hand combat in your quest to defeat the evil tyrant Valrog, who has taken over the land of Banzaari. Levels vary from jumping puzzles to hoverboarding, flying and buggy riding. The game features a large amount of constantly attacking enemies, and its combat is very similar to the punch/kick attacks of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kung+Fu+Master\">Kung-Fu Master</a>.  <br><br>The game was originally titled &quot;The Woo-Lan Kid&quot;, but was re-named to suit a younger audience.
