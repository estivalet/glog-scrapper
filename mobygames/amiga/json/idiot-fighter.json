  "description": "<i>Idiot Fighter</i> is a fighting game parody for the Amiga. It requires two players with joysticks to play. There are two fighters: a blue stick figure with no arms and curly hair, who attacks by kicking, and a white stick figure with no arms and curly hair, who attacks by whipping out a gigantic tongue. You can block by moving backwards away from your opponent while they are attacking. There are three rounds in a fight.",
