  "description": "By 2011, the only way to travel at top speed is on skyways build high above the ground. These become popular with boy-racers and general speed freaks pretty soon, and that's why you're aiming to hurtle across them in this arcade conversion.<br><br>The road scrolls vertically, with some moderately sharp bends in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Spy+Hunter\">Spy Hunter</a> You have a jump device to clear the many jumps,  or to land onto and flatten the other maniacs who line the road. You must choose which path to follow at <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/outrun\">OutRun</a>-style forks in the road. <br><br>The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage. If you leave the road you must replace your car onto it using a directable winch which appears at the appropriate point.",
