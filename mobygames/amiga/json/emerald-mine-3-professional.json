  "description": "<i>Emerald Mine 3 Professional</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> variant and features no gameplay changes in comparison to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/emerald-mine-ii\">predecessor</a>. The player's goal is to collect diamonds which are surrounded by dirt within a time limit. When walking over an dirt spot, it is cleared and an stone above it will fall down - with unhealthy results if the player or a monster is hit by it. Other items are dynamite to clear out boulders and keys for certain doors.<br><br>The need to plan ahead and find out the required steps to reach the diamonds give the game a puzzle-solving character. Each player has to create a profile which is assigned a handicap (zero to eight), depending on the already solved levels. Each level has a difficulty level assigned to it and the player can freely choose levels which are equal or below the handicap.\nThere are also additional levels for two players. ",
