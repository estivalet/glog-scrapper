  "description": "The <i>Simulcra</i> unit was thought to be the last best hope for peace. International disputes could be battled out in a simulated environment, in a world with no real guns or bombs. Unfortunately, the system malfunctioned and began generating real weapons and tanks to attack the outside world.<br><br>You are the man charged with putting a stop to all of this. In your ground-skimming SRV, remove the power lines that keep Simulcra functional. Shoot out each of the energy projectors which block your path to clear each of the 30 matrices.<br><br>The action is viewed from immediately behind you, showing a world of pathways and gaps which rotate as you move your craft, which can also reverse. You will have to fight off guns, planes and everything else the embattled system can throw at you. Destroying these releases pods which give extras such as improved weaponry and extra energy when collected. A full map of the area is provided.",
