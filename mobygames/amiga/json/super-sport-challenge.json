  "description": "One of the last multi-event sports simulations, ten events are brought to life here, including sprints, hurdles, swimming, and field events. None of the events feature joystick-waggling - the only consistant comparison is the 1500m event from Daley Thompson's Decathlon. Your athlete starts with a limited amount of energy, which must be used as appropriate. Moving the joystick left or right releases it, while the fire button activates a 'turbo' mode of sorts - a quick burst of extreme energy which must be used wisely. A variety of perspectives are used for the events, including one of the first uses of isometric graphics in a sport game.",
