  "description": "The basic Tetris gameplay, involving arranging each shape as you are given them to create complete lines, and then adjust to the remaining fragments falling down a line and perhaps blocking off lower lines, was reinvented in this title. The game is split into levels, and each one requires a set number of lines to be completed. As you do so, you gradually reveal a cartoony picture, varying from semi-naked girls to candles.<br><br>The levels usually have some amount of blocks already in place, which must be worked around, and often specify that picture lines are only awarded when you score 2 or more lines at a time. There are also power-ups, which come in some of the square blocks and are activated if you use them to complete a line. They include points bonuses, bombs to remove some of the existing tiles, and some ‘power-downs’, such as one which turns the screen upside down, and one that removes the preview of the piece.\n",
