  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mario+Kart\">Mario Kart</a> is taken one step further in this racer. The computer racers include Loretta L’Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos.<br><br>The courses are quite lengthy, and are laden with hazards and power-ups such as oil slicks and homing missiles. The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front – strange.<br><br>The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/outrun\">OutRun</a> tradition. \n",
