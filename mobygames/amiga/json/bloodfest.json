  "description": "<i>BloodFest</i> is a first-person &quot;dungeon crawler&quot; style of RPG, with a sci-fi setting: you are on a spaceship in deep space, investigating after something went very wrong during an experiment in using wormholes for interstellar travel. The visual style of the game resembles first-person shooters, especially <i>Doom</i>, but you control the game with a mouse cursor instead of direct controls. There is an action bar at the bottom of the screen that includes a weapon selector, an &quot;attack&quot; button to use the selected weapon, six arrow buttons for moving and turning, a visual display of the protagonist's face, and a text line for describing objects you are looking at.",
