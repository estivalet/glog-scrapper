With MERLIN you fly the new Thunderhawk AH-73M combat helicopter against conflicts all over the world.<br><br>Gameplay consists of flying campaigns in ten areas of the world, where you must complete primary and secondary objectives. Each campaign is typically made out of around five missions that are themed according to real life events from the part of the world they take place in.<br><br>Your helicopter is loaded with weapons at the start of the mission; machine gun, fire and forget rockets, depth charges, bombs and missiles. When a mission demands specific type of armament, such as a runway cratering system for airbase objective it is automatically loaded. You encounter various hostiles during the missions, both airborne and land based which can be taken care of with the loaded armament.<br><br>Once the primary objective is completed you need to return safely to base. Your helicopter can only sustain a limited amount of damage, so you have to plot your course wisely.",
