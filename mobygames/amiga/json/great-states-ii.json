  "description": "<i>Great States II</i> is an educational game teaching geography. The main game is a map based quiz that exist in eight varieties with different subjects: states, capitals, birds, flowers, trees, date entered union, state abbreviation and state nickname. They all work in the same way with the player being presented with a map and has to either click on the correct country or type in its name for each question given. A game runs until a set number of questions have been asked. Additionally there is a tutorial where the player can explore the states and get info and maps which show various statistics such as vegetation and population.<br><br>The updated version called World Tour: United States has some changes in presentation (for example cars have been replaced with balloons) and adds a quiz with flags. It also features certificates, word search games and quizzes that can be printed.",
