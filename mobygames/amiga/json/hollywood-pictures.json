  "description": "With 20000 dollars in your pockets and a cinema with 5 movie rooms you are starting to make a great movie maker career. First you buy some old, real-named movies (for example Star Wars, Evil Dead, etc) for showing them in your cinema. You can fix the prices for the tickets individual. Each movie room can have up to 5 performances a day. When you earned enough money you can do some more interesting things. Producing your own movie. Either you buy a shooting script or you make your own one by clicking some pretended words and choosing a film genre. After this you must select some actors and a director for your forthcoming blockbuster. At least you look for the locality, special effects, film music and more things. After all your movie will be rated by a jury and earns (it is to be hoped) your capital for the next blockbuster.",
