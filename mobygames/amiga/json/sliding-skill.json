  "description": "<i>Sliding Skill</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/puzznic\">Puzznic</a> variant. In each of the hundred levels the goal is to destroy all movable blocks by sliding them into each other. As soon as a block is moved into a direction, it moves until it meets an obstacle. Blocks can only be pushed so it is important to plan ahead. Of course there are obstacles (e.g. moving walls, tiles which break away after being stepped on or the time limit) and power ups (e.g. a sucker to get a stone out of a bad position) which influence the gameplay.",
