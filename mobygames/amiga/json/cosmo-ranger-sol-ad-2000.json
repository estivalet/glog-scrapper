  "description": "<i>Cosmo Ranger: S.O.L. AD 2000</i> is a futuristic sci-fi driven side-scrolling platform and elevators’ style shoot em’ up action game. <br><br>The crux of the play chiefly consists of making your way around the decks of each of the three main levels of a space station, negotiating hostile automatons with your trusty laser blaster. Access hatches about the station can be searched, and yield helpful items such as extra health, oxygen or laser ammo. The primary objective on each of the three levels is to reactivate all of the safety computer panels. <br><br>At times during play, the station may be attacked by an armada of alien war ships. Where by you must find the on-board teleportation system on that level, in order to beam yourself to the tactical station, to man the defences, and neutralise the threat. This portion of the game takes place from the first-person perspective. \n",
