  "description": "The game is set in the future where human existence is threatened. The gene code has become weaker in every generation and is getting close to frailty. Scientists build a cyborg to save human beings. To test this cyborg they send him out for a bio challenge.  You play this cyborg ( K.L.I.P.T.) and therefore you take this challenge. Your only mission is to survive!<br><br>Slightly difficult 2D platform game, with nice graphics and animations and one of the best works from Jean Baudlot in case of music (Amiga Version).",
