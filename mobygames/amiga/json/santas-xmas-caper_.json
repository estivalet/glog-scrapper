  "description": "Despite being published by the same company and sharing the same title, <i>Santa's Xmas Caper</i> on the Amiga is different from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/santas-xmas-caper\">its 8-bit cousins</a>. Instead of a scrolling shoot 'em up, it is a platform game. <br><br>While riding on his slide, Santa loses all his pressies. The gifts scattered all across the country, Santa must traverse multiple-scrolling platform-levels collecting them back. When they are all collected, an exit opens granting him access to the next level.\nEach level is crowded with spiky pitfalls, slippery platforms and cute-looking but nasty baddies. By throwing snowballs, the baddies can be stunned for a short while.\nComplete all seven levels and Christmas will be saved.",
