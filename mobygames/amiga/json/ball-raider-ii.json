  "description": "Unashamed Breakout/Arkanoid clone. Use your bat to deflect the ball into the coloured bricks. Some bricks hide bonuses, which yield benefits such as an enlarged bat, laser firing ability, or multiplying the number of balls in play. You have 3 lives at the start of the game and you will find they don't last very long, unless your reflexes serve you well.",
