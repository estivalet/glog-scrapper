  "description": "<i>Méwilo</i> is a 1st person point &amp; click adventure game that plays on the Caribbean island Martinique. You, an expert in paranormal phenomena, arrive by ship at the town St Pierre on Martinique on May 7, 1902, a day before volcano Mount Pelée will erupt and destroy the town. You are invited by your friends, Geneviève and Michel Hubert-Destouches to investigate what is happening in their house, which seems to be haunted by a zombie. It's your task to find out what has happened and to find a way to let your friends live in peace again. <br><br>With a &quot;colibri cursor&quot; you can click on a map to visit various locations on the island (thanks to your own paranormal abilities you can explore places as a colibri). By investigating/interrogating the player also learns about the  history of the island (especially during an extensive multiple choice puzzle). Some of the puzzles require that the player types in the right answer. \nThe game has a small inventory (with three slots) and a scoring system with a maximum of 99 points. It includes some animations, music and sound. It was published in a German and French version. The manual includes a short story by the Martinician author Patrick Chamoiseau and a calalou recipe; the package contains an audio tape by the Martinician band Malavoi.\n",
