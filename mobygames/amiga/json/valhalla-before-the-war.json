  "description": "In this prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/valhalla-and-the-lord-of-infinity\">Valhalla and the Lord of Infinity</a>, you play Infinity's mentor on his quest of hatred in which murder is the ultimate goal.<br><br>Infinity has been jealous of his brother, the Good King Garamond, for as long as he can remember, and all for a twist of fate. Infinity had been born too late to be king.<br><br>Set in the mystical castle of Valhalla, you encounter a horde of brain melting puzzles through four vast levels of dazzling graphics and exceptional gameplay in which the art of communication is the name of the game. <br><br>Use the joystick button to bring up a series of icon that let you access a map of the level, or to look at, pick up, operate, or move objects. The disk icon that is among them allows you to save, load, or restart a game. Some of these icons are available when you choose to use an inventory object on something on the screen. <br><br>There are two bars on either side of the screen. One bar is your stamina. Whenever you stand on a hazard, your stamina decreases. When you have no stamina left, you die and are forced to restart the level. The other bar indicates, if you have picked up a flask, how much time that you have left before it is empty.\n",
