  "description": "<i>Xenostar</i> is a multi-directional shoot 'em up modeled after the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sinistar\">Sinistar</a> (1982). While you guide your modest but frantic spacecraft around and try to mine minerals, red constructor ships are also busy mining them, protected by grey defense ships. With the minerals, they will try to construct Xenostar, an incredibly evil and hungry entity. Converting the minerals you collect into Xenobombs, you stand a chance of destroying this monster once he announces... &quot;I live!''",
