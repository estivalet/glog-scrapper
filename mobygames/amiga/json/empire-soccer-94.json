  "description": "Rather than copying <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sensible+Soccer%27\">Sensible Soccer</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kick+Off%27\">Kick Off</a>, this football game features a number of comical and unrealistic touches. Although the view is top-down, the pitch is small and square, and the players appear huge on it. A range of moves including overhead kicks, trapping the ball and quick 1-2 passes can be mastered.<br><br>Before each match your team can choose special moves to assign to each player - power shots with ludicrous curve, super dribbling (making the ball stick to your foot), and a Barge power to push players out of the way. A full world cup tournament is offered, which up to 8 human players can partake in, as well as single exhibition matches. The action replays feature a VCR-style control.",
