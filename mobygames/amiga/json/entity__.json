  "description": "Bud Lightning returns in <i>Entity</i>, a sci-fi point &amp; click graphic adventure and the sequel to <i>The Experiment</i>. This time, Bud is sent on a mission to investigate the Du Pont, a rich tycoon's private spacecraft that suddenly stopped responding to communications. The game begins as Bud arrives on the ship, and it is immediately clear something is very wrong.<br><br>The interface divides the screen vertically into two parts: the top half shows the current scene from a third-person perspective, and underneath is an action bar with six buttons (&quot;Look At&quot;, &quot;Pick Up&quot;, &quot;Use ... with ...&quot;, &quot;Operate&quot;, &quot;Talk to&quot; and &quot;Shoot&quot;) and a panel that displays the inventory items you are carrying. The left mouse button is used to select action buttons, select inventory items, and to direct the main character to walk to the clicked position in the scene. The right mouse button is used to perform an action on a room object or character. There are 10 savegame slots that can be saved to by holding down shift and pressing a function key F1-F10, and later loaded from by pressing the same function key without holding down shift.",
