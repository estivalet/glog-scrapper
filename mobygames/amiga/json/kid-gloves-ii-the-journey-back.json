  "shortName": "kid-gloves-ii-the-journey-back",
  "description": "A platform game resembling Mario and Wonderboy quite strongly. Kid must rescue the woman he loves by crossing 6 worlds, each split into 4 levels. There are a range of baddies to beat, following pre-set attack patterns or just staying on the spot, to be killed using your sword.<br><br>Once killed most release things like tokens, keys (sometimes required to open end-of-level doors), apples (for extra energy) and occasionally poison. There are lots of semi-hidden sections and bonus areas to find and explore, including bonus arcade games and fruit machines. Every world ends with a boss.",
