  "description": "Explora 3 is a french point-and-click adventure game, the final sequel of the original Explora (released as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/chrono-quest\">Chrono Quest</a> in English-speaking markets). The time traveling antics of the other games continue on this title, albeit in a more tangential way. You play as a writer with a severe lack of ideas that has a 3 month deadline to deliver a manuscript to his publisher. While watching TV you see your name linked to a report about a mysterious murder. It is your job to unravel this conspiracy.<br><br>The interface of the game has a more minimalist approach this time, the icons were reduced to only three revolving on the bottom-right of the screen: a magnifying glass to examine the scenario, a hand to pick and drop things, and a hammer as the &quot;use&quot; verb. Above these icons there is a clock: the developers added a dimension of time to the proceedings, and certain actions can only be performed at an exact time point. This installment also ditches the synthesized speech of the second game. <br><br>The games of this series share a common trait of being quite unforgiving: the player can easily get stuck on a unwinnable situation by forgetting to take some crucial object or not performing the exact action at the exact time. Death also comes swiftly and unexpected, sometimes only by opening a door at the wrong moment.",
