  "description": "<i>Labyrinth</i> is a maze game in which two balls started a competition. Whoever is the fastest through the 50 levels of Xanden is the winner. The game is primarily a multiplayer split-screen game, but can also be played alone. The principle is simple: a maze is shown in a top-down view and the goal is to find the exit as fast as possible. In the mazes a few extra symbols can be found, e.g. one sends the player back to the beginning.",
