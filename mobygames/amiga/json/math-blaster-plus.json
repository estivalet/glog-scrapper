  "description": "An updated version of the older Math Blaster! educational game.  Unlike the previous version, this one's not in BASIC!<br><br>A new GUI greets users, called the &quot;Davidson Student Desktop Interface&quot;- this allows people to switch from one portion of the game to the next  without all that nasty _typing_.<br><br>The math is broken down into five subjects- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions/decimals/percents.  The game itself is broken into 5 activities-<br><br>Countdown- a flash-card style &quot;game&quot; with no scoring or timing.  A problem, with answer, is shown on screen- upon command, the same problem appears sans answer, and must be answered correctly.<br><br>Ignition- problems appear, and upon a correct answer, motivational messages and animations pop up.  The player has two chances to answer correctly, and receives a scoreboard at the end showing number of problems, number solved, etc.  (This scoreboard appears in the next two listed activities.)<br><br>Lift-off- problems appear, with answer, but missing an internal component (like 2 * _ = 12).  Three chances per problem are given to answer correctly.  Once again, there are encouraging messages and animations- and a certificate of achievement may be printed out.<br><br>Orbit- three problems appear on-screen with portions of each in boxes; these boxes may contain errors and need to be changed by the player.  Each correct answer earns a star, and the player can attempt to answer twice.  This one also can print a certificate of achievement.<br><br>Blasternaut- the action-oriented math activity- you control a Blasternaut that must get into a rocket aimed at the correct answer to a shown problem.  Bonus points are awarded if you can rescue floating Blasternauts- apparently slamming into them with the nosecone of a huge rocket constitutes help.<br><br>The math problems contained within aren't randomly generated, but are pre-written lessons (which are handily printed in the instruction manuals.)  Math Blaster Plus! can be used to create new lessons, can be used in a classroom setting to track individual students' performance, and can print stored lessons as paper-based quizzes/tests for more traditional (and more boring) use.<br><br>",
