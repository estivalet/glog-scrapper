  "description": "The alien race Hellraisers seized the planet Hazbal which is an important junction of space trade routes. The player's job is to drive them out of the system. The game consists of six levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. In the first, third and fifth level the player controls the mercenary himself who walks and jumps through the side-scrolling levels. With his weapon he shoots everything that moves and uses teleporters and holes to find his way. The other levels are horizontally shooters in a top-down perspective. The player controls a space ship, moves through the levels and shoots everything that moves. Killed enemies may leave symbols behind which give advantages when picked up.",
