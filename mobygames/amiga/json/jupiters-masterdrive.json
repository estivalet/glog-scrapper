  "description": "Jupiter and its moons are colonized, and are an ideal setting for motor racing. 3 lap races featuring 3 cars each take place, viewed from above. Weapons which can throw a car off course are commonplace, as are short cuts and speed-boosting pads (which do not always follow a conventional racing line). As well as the races, there are timed money-collecting bonus duels on enclosed circuits.<br><br>You are one of the competitors, either in single races or a full season. Money is won for results, and collected as it lies on track. This can be spent on improvements such as engine and armor upgrades, as well as more powerful races.",
