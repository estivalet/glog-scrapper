  "description": "From the Racter FAQ:<blockquote><br>In 1984, William Chamberlain published a book called &quot;The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed&quot; (Warner Books, NY. 0-446-38051-2, paper $9.95). The introduction claims: &quot;With the exception of this introduction, the writing in this book was all done by computer.&quot; <br><br>The authorship is attributed to RACTER, originally &quot;written in compiled BASIC on a Z80 with 64k of RAM.&quot;</blockquote>Racter strings together words according to &quot;syntax directives&quot;, and the illusion of coherence is increased by repeated re-use of text variables.  This gives the appearance that Racter can actually have a conversation with the user that makes some sense, unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Eliza\">Eliza</a>, which just spits back what you type at it.  Of course, such a program has not been written to perfection yet, but Racter comes somewhat close.  <br><br>Since some of the syntactical mistakes that Racter tends to make cannot be avoided, the decision was made to market the game in a humorous vein, which the marketing department at <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Mindscape%2c+Inc%2e\">Mindscape</a> dubbed &quot;tongue-in-chip software&quot; and &quot;artificial insanity&quot;.",
