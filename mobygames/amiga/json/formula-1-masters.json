  "description": "You can try your hand at managing a Formula 1 team of your choice in this simulation. First of all you must choose your team and sign deals with drivers and engine and tyre suppliers, all from within your budget – pit crews must be hired and engine performance maximised within the remaining budget.<br><br>Between races you must select tyre compounds and wing settings for the circuit, and can peruse championship standings and records. The races are depicted form a side-view of the cars completing the laps, with any position changes, retirements or changes in track conditions reported. You can call your drivers in for new tyres, although refuelling isn’t a feature. \n",
