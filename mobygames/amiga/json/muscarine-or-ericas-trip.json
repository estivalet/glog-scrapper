  "description": "<i>Muscarine</i> is a psychedelic point &amp; click adventure game. The main character is a young woman named Erica Evermore, who goes to sleep after consuming mushroom soup made from the large red mushrooms that grow near her tiny house. After a dream about walking down a long strange tunnel, she wakes to find herself in a surreal otherworldly version of her home. The world outside has changed dramatically too, and even her own body has transformed into some kind of alien creature.<br><br>The interface splits the screen vertically: the current scene is shown from a third-person perspective, and underneath is an action panel which displays the inventory items that Erica is carrying, as well as nine action buttons: &quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;Give&quot;, &quot;Talk to&quot;, &quot;Look at&quot;, &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Close&quot;, &quot;Use&quot; and &quot;Consume&quot;.",
