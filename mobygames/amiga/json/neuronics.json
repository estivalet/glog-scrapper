  "description": "<i>Neuronics</i> is a tile-matching puzzle game with similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/swap\">Swap</a>:  The player is presented with a number of tiles with different symbols and colours. If two or more identical tiles are next to each other (diagonally does not count), they disappear. To make this happen, the player can swap two adjacent tiles. However, there is a time limit to consider and empty places left behind by removed tiles are not usable. The goal is to clear the whole field.",
