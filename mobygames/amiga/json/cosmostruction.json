  "description": "<i>Cosmostruction</i> is a turn based strategy game set in a futuristic space setting. The background story involve a space faring race called the Telerons whose home planet has been drained of resources and now are depending on space colonies for survival. These colonies require an enormous amount of energy and it's meeting this energy need that cosmostructing is all about. The game involves two competing team, Terrans and Melorians, who has to construct an energy duct that drains planetoids and asteroids and transfer the energy to a space colony. The aim then is to get the highest score since only the most successful team will be paid by the Telerons.<br><br>The game has two phases. First an energy duct has to be constructed between the Kriton colony to the Micrest planetoid and then one from the Belgea colony to the Zaitori planetoid. Players earn points by placing tubings on stable asteroids, by communicating properly with Teleron space ships and being the first to connect a tubing to a planetoid. But players can also lose points by placing tubings on unstable asteroids and by failing to communicate properly with the Teleron space ships.<br><br>When starting out each player has ten mines to place in unoccupied grids on the space map. The maps are hidden and will destroy a tubing that is placed on it. Once this is done the players moves on to the bridge from where the all operations of building energy ducts are done. The construction of the energy ducts works similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pipe+Mania\">Pipe Mania</a>, with the players choosing from five available tubings that has to be connected to the energy duct. There are eight different tubings with different point values depending on shape and they can be rotated to fit the existing energy duct. Both player build on the same energy duct and has to in each turn add at least one but not more than five tubings. ",
