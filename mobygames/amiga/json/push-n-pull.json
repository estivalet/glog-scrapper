  "description": "<i>Push 'n Pull</i> is a non-scrolling action game which takes place on top-down playing fields. The player takes the role of the rabbit Pull who has to kill all enemies on screen. This is accomplished by shoving blocks in their direction - those blocks only stop when they meet another block or a wall and destroy all enemies in their way. However, Pull's power decreases with every pushed stone and needs to be refreshed by collecting power pills. There are also some especially marked blocks which crush when pushed and reveal power-ups like higher speed, extra lives or invulnerability.  Bomb blocks explode on impact which is the only thing capable of destroying star blocks. Those hide especially powerful items.",
