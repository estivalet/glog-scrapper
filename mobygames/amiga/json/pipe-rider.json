  "description": "<i>Pipe Rider</i> is a basic shooter. The player controls either one or two cannons which run on a string. The goal of each level is to kill all aliens on the screen. Getting hit by an enemy bullet means losing a life and running out of time results in an instant game over. There are also a few extras to collect which are dropped by dead aliens and go into the inventory when picked up.<br><br>There are two kinds of levels which appear alternating. In the first, the player has two cannons and the string goes around all four sides of the screen. In the second the cannon is restricted to the bottom of the screen while a bar (continuously moving downwards) restricts the alien movement.",
