  "description": "<i>Mega Phoenix</i> brings the concept of the earlier arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Phoenix\">Phoenix</a> into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Gaelco\">Gaelco</a>. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.<br><br>The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.",
