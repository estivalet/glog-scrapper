  "description": "<i>Ybrick</i> is a simple puzzle game where you must fill up a square board with different tiles. The board is arranged in interleaved rows. Tiles can only be placed on the bottom or on top of other tiles, but two tiles of the same kind can't come into contact, or they will disappear, putting you further from your goal. The game plays in a window of the Workbench and is mouse-controlled. Another variant on the same game exists, called <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bricky\">Bricky</a></i>.",
