The player controls a space ship shown from a side view in a 2D environment. The plane can freely move left or right in a scrolling environment that wraps around. Your mission is to defend little penguinoids from being captured and mutated. To do that a variety of aliens needs to be battled. Smart bombs can be used to destroy an entire screen worth of foes.",
