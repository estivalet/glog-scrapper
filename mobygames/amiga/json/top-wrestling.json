  "description": "<i>Top Wrestling</i> is a one-on-one wrestling game. The player controls one of 16 selectable wrestlers and must defeat all the others in a tournament, or selected individual opponents in a single match.<br><br>Selectable wrestlers include spoofs of actual then-WWF wrestlers (such as Hulk Hogan, Sergeant Slaughter, Brutus Beefcake or Shawn Michaels) and other celebrities, as well as original characters. The wrestlers have all the same set of moves: there are no signature moves or distinguishing techniques between them. The moves each wrestler can perform include a standard punch, knee strike, dropkick and throw. Diving drops can also be performed from a turnbuckle when the opponent is down.<br><br>Competitive multiplayer is available in single match mode. The game can be saved to disk during a tournament.",
