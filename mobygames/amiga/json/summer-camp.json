  "description": "In Summer Camp, you play Maximus Mouse.  The flag of Wottadump has gone missing, 24 hours before the start of the season.  Maximus must find a replacement, and decides to get the one on the moon.<br><br>The game is a platform game, made up of four levels, each made up of a collection of inter-connected screens.  There are a variety of objects to collect, but the aim on each level is to collect the parts (found in ACME crates) of a vehicle to get to the next one.<br><br>When all the parts are in place, there is a sub-game where the vehicle is constructed, although this is only for bonus points.
