  "description": "The text adventure &quot;I Rescued Elvis from Communist Alien Jerks!&quot; is a sci-fi comedy about alien abduction. The introductory text is set after the events of the game: the main character arrives shaken and dazed at a local bar, meets up with a friend and -- beer in hand -- starts describing what just happened to them. The game then begins in flashback shortly before the protagonist was abducted: in the dead of night, while they were standing out in an Alabama cornfield.<br><br>&quot;I Rescued Elvis...&quot; was created using the Dream Weaver authoring system (not to be confused with Adobe Dreamweaver). The interface is similar to adventure games produced by Legend Entertainment in the early 1990s such as Spellcasting 101 and Eric the Unready, where about a quarter of the screen is used to show the actual game text, then there is a small static picture of the current scene (shown from first-person perspective), and the rest of the screen is filled with helpful GUI gadgets that the player can use instead of manually typing in commands. There are clickable arrows for the main compass directions (and up/down movement), action buttons (look at, take, drop, etc.) along with a list of less-common actions the player might want to try (search, smash, sit on), and two lists of available objects: one for objects in the current room, and one for inventory objects the player is carrying, with a toggle button to switch between them.",
