  "description": "<i>TeleWar</i> is a two-player strategy game intended to be played via modem, alternatively via null-modem or taking turns at a single computer.<br><br>In a split screen fashion, the top half of the screen features low resolution graphics, while the lower half contains a high-resolution user interface and a chatlog. The game is entirely controlled using the mouse, cycling between units of your army and pointing them at their destination, rotating turrets and firing using buttons at the bottom half of the screen. <br><br>The army consists of light and heavy artillery, light and heavy armour and supply trucks which can supply units with ammunition and fuel. Both supplies must be conserved, or your army will grind to a halt. Firing can be done in eight directions, requiring careful placement of your units. Each unit has different range, fire power and amount of fuel and ammunition. Since the screen is cramped, a single slow unit may block the advance of several others, necessitating careful movement. A turn may be sacrificed to call in air support, as long as the enemy hasn't destroyed your radio antenna.<br><br>The game is finished once the enemy army is destroyed, or if the flag is captured. Four scenarios and four kinds of terrain are supported.<br><br><i>TeleWar</i> was followed by <i>TeleWar II</i> and had a medieval spinoff in the shape of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/teleepic\">TeleEpic</a></i>. It was later refined into <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-combat-computer-battle-game\">Operation Com•Bat</a></i>.",
