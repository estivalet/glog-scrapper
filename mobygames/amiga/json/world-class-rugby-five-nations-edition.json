  "description": "<i>World Class Rugby: Five Nations Edition</i> is an updated version of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/world-class-rugby\">World Class Rugby</a> that was released the year before. The gameplay is largely the same but has remade AI and simplified controls. The main addition to the game is a new game mode based on the Five Nations championship where five European national sides (England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) compete for the trophy. In addition to the new mode the old world cup mode from the previous game is still in the game.",
