  "description": "<i>Chess 2.0</i> is an updated Amiga port of the <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/chess_______\">Stanback Chess Program</a></i>. In contrast to the 1.0 port, this version has a fully mouse-driven graphical interface, while retaining the original <i>SCP</i> chess engine. Each game starts with setting the chess timer. Since the computer uses all the time alloted to calculate as many moves as possible, fast players are usually favoured over slow-thinking ones. Games can be saved and loaded, the board can be flipped and players can change sides. The colours of the board and pieces may be changed, and there is online help. The program may give hints, there is an &quot;undo&quot; function and the board may be manipulated, removing or adding pieces. The list of moves may be saved to disk or viewed on-screen, and there is a bank of game openings supplied.",
