  "description": "<i>The Chronicles of Omega</i> is a side-scrolling platformer in which demons took control over the village Omega. The player takes control over one of the twins Alwin and Irma in their quest to drive those evil beasts out. Most of the time is spent with jumping, dodging enemies or killing them with the magic wand which shoots fire balls. The player character has a bar of life energy which decreases when hit by an enemy and when it runs out, a life is lost. Killed enemies leave money behind which can be used to purchase power-ups in shops.",
