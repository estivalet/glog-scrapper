  "description": "Though the title is a pun on <i><moby game=\"Rise of the Robots\">Rise of the Robots</i>, this is a clone of <i><moby game=\"Dynablaster\">Dynablaster</i>. Up to four players may compete in a hunt for four stars hidden inside blocks, blowing up the blocks with their bombs — or blowing each other up. There are various other items on the screen, such as extra bombs, liquor bottles which reverse the controls, a gun to shoot blocks, speed-ups, a stop sign that halts all other players and a skul that makes you lose all you've picked up.<br><br>The game is only 32 kilobyte large, made for the 32k game competition at the Mekka &amp; Symposium demo party in Fallingbostel, Germany.",
