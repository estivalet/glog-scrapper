  "description": "The overall premise of <i>Pinkie</i> is that Dinosaur eggs have to be collected in the galaxy to keep them from being extinct. This task falls to Pinkie, who is as cute-looking as his name implies, who has to visit about 60 platform levels. Those are shown from the side, scroll in all directions and have hidden areas. Each planet is represented by an overworld map, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros-3\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, where Pinkie chooses the next level to visit. <br><br>The catch of the game is that Pinkie is totally defenseless and dies from one hit. However, he has a vehicle called the Pinkie Pod. As long as he mans the Pod, he is not only invulnerably but can utilize its many useful features like high speed, a catapult seat to reach high places or room to stash the eggs. Between levels Pinkie can purchase upgrades, some of which are necessary to find all three hidden eggs in a level. As long as Pinkie is outside the Pod, it can be destroyed by enemies.",
