  "description": "A very long time ago, aliens planted a few offsprings on Earth's ocean grounds until they grow strong. However, humanity wakes them from their sleep with atomic tests and therefore a big war. The player mans a futuristic fighter plane to drive them back during 20 missions. While the cockpit perspective with relatively detailed information prompts and the open locations remind of simulation games, this is a pure shooter. A radar shows where the main mission objective is, the player flies there while shooting everything in the way. Killed enemies sometimes leave power-ups behind which reward additional ammo or upgrades for the weapon systems. The game tracks locational damage which may result in malfunction of a ship part.",
