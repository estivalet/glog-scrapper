  "description": "In <i>Paramax</i>, the player is trapped in a virtual world. It consists of several sub-worlds, representing the levels of the game, which have to be crossed before winning the game. This is a traditional, side-scrolling platformer in which the player walks from left to right while avoiding enemies (respectively killing them with the laser gun) and jumping over gaps. Additionally there is the need to hurry because each level has a time limit. There are various extras to collect on the way, e.g. shoes for a higher jump, smart bombs to get rid of multiple enemies at once, extra time or extra lives.",
