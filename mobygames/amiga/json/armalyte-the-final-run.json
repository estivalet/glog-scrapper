  "description": "In the infamous Delta sector of space, the evil aliens of the Aalan Empire have invaded four peaceful planets. The people of Earth, fearing to be next, send a preemptive strike: Armalyte Force. Naturally, they run into a trap, and only a single ship survives. Our hero now has to free the four occupied planets and then strike at the Aalan homeworld.<br><br><i>Armalyte: The Final Run</i>, like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/armalyte\">C64 namesake</a>, is a traditional side-scrolling shoot'em up heavily inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/r-type\">R-Type</a>, giving the player's spaceship the task of traversing five levels. The starting setup is a simple forward-facing shot as well as a power shot that must be charged by holding on to the fire button. Upgrades are a forward-facing three-way, a vertical two-way, or the addition of a single backwards shot (only one of the three at a time). Also available are pods that attach to the ship and fire a forwards laser, and, only in the final level, self-homing missiles.<br><br>The levels not only feature many enemy formations, but also environmental hazards, like drops of acid or falling stalactites. On one occasion, the scrolling speeds up, making the level a hazard course. Each stage ends with the customary end boss.",
