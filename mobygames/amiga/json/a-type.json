  "description": "Built around a shoot'em'up engine developed in 1994, A-Type was put together using ripped graphics from the famous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=R-Type\">R-Type</a> for the 32K game compo at the Mekka/Symposium demo party in 1998. Though the game is superficially similar to R-Type, it features a different level layout (only one level to fit into 32 kilobytes) and different playmechanics. Your ship has autofire, and the enemies, while rather stupid, can absorb a lot of shots. The weapon upgrade pods are there, but you lack R-Type's famous &quot;Force&quot; as well as the charged power shots. The game does not end with a boss battle, instead the level shrinks until you crash into a greeting message!",
