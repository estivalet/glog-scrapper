  "description": "A multi-level vertically scrolling shoot 'em up along similar lines to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/swiv\">SWIV</a>. You fly a plane through inhospitable landscapes full of enemy fighters and gun turrets. Most of the planes come at you in formation, firing easily-visible orange bullets at you, and can be either shot or avoided. The turrets are capable of rotating in 8 directions and aiming at you as best they can, so be careful to dodge their bullets. <br><br>There are also larger vehicles which fly down the screen in a direct vertical line. The helicopters hold power-ups including extra weapons (which you only get for a limited number of shots; this is the one time where holding down fire constantly (on an auto fire joystick) isn't hugely beneficial), speed-ups and energy recharge (once your vehicle's damage reaches 100%, you lose that one of your 5 lives). The planes are huge and fire a constant volley at you, but offer a huge 5,000 points if taken down. At the end of each level an even bigger plane comes at you, weaving from left to right while gradually moving down the screen (and eventually out of the bottom of the screen and back through the top).\n",
