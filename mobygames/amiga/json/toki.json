  "description": "The hands of Bashtar have whisked Moho away from her beloved Toki. Toki hasn't fared much better as he has been transformed into an ape by the sorcerer Vookimedlo. Now Toki must rescue his love and find a way to transform himself back into a man.<br><br><i>Toki</i> consists of six stages which are The Labyrinth of Caves, the underwater stage Lake Neptune, Caverns of Fire, Ice Palace, Dark Jungle, and the Golden Palace. Toki's main attack against his enemies is by spitting at them although he can also hop on them to defeat them. Toki's normal spit can be changed to a fire breath by finding the correct item. Other items include items like a football helmet which temporarily shields Toki, high jump shoes, clocks that add time, coins which add to Toki's life count, and fruits which add to the total score.<br><br>Instead of dying in one hit, the NES version added a health meter. A version of the game also exists for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/toki-going-ape-spit\">Genesis</a>, however the game features different stage layouts plus additional levels and different enemies.",
