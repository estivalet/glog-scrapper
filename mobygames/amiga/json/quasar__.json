  "description": "<i>Quasar</i> is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up where the player's task is to retrieve the stolen Eye of Quasar. To do so he has access to three star class five space ships that are equipped with ion shields that can absorb some damage before being destroyed. The default weapon of the craft is a pulse cannon but by collecting star mines it can be upgraded into, multi, laser and missile weapons. At the same time it's necessary to avoid tractor mines which can be deactivated by fire. The game consists of five different sectors that the player has to fly through. Many different obstacles will have to be navigated past, including meteor showers, sun corridors, underground caverns, acid seas and ice barriers. There will also be enemies in form of guardians which can only be destroyed by shooting at their power globes. ",
