  "description": "A &quot;Memory&quot; game where you flip cards to find matching pairs. If the pairs don't match, the cards are flipped again, so that you must memorise the position of each card flipped in order to beat the computer (which doesn't have the kind of exact memory you'd expect of a computer).<br><br>During play, the computer chats along, commenting on how the game is going, bragging when it finds a pair and complementing your play style. A &quot;peek&quot; option will flash the cards for a few seconds so that you can refresh your memory — and your opponent's. Running in low resolution, the game is fully system friendly and comes with source code in C language.",
