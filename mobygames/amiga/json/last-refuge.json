  "description": "<i>The sudden and unexpected return of evil swept the land like a hurricane. The unprepared armies tried their best to defend the kingdom but could not drive back the up rush, thus forcing the king to withdraw the remainder to the defense of a handful of castles. As the main part of the army was destroyed within the first days all castles are practically defenseless. So it was proclaimed that the man who succeeds in repulsing the evil up rush may win the hand of princess Kana and inherit the throne. You take a chance.</i><br><br><b>The Last Refuge</b> is a freeware <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-invaders________\">Space Invaders</a> clone for the Amiga, distributed on disk 728 of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,276004/\">Fred Fish</a> collection. As a knight, the player has to fend off an invading army and protect the castle walls. One variation to the formula is the addition of power-ups hidden inside chests. These are marked with a symbol to differentiate each type:<br><br>- The weapons chests have a red symbol, and come with a <b>single shot</b>, <b>double shot</b>, <b>light beam</b>, <b>bombs</b>, <b>guided shot</b> and <b>&quot;unknown&quot;</b> power-ups.<br><br>- There is a brown symbol on the spell chests. They contain <b>slow/speed</b>, <b>weaken/strengthen</b>, <b>kill all visible</b> and <b>&quot;unknown&quot;</b> spells.<br><br>- The extras chests have a black symbol. They come with <b>stop time</b>, <b>protection</b>, <b>shield</b>, <b>super shot</b>, <b>&quot;unknown&quot;</b> and <b>extra life</b> power-ups.",
