  "description": "<i>Evil Garden</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Centipede\">Centipede</a> variant. As with the original, the principle is that a centipede roams around the playing field and the player, stationed at the bottom row, tries to shoot it. Every time a part of the centipede is hit, it disappears. If two different parts are left, i.e. a part which is not the front or back is hit, they continue to move on their own. There are multiple obstacles, e.g. mushrooms which bounce back shots or lice which drop stones on the player, which try to hinder progress. On the other hand helpful power ups can be collected which have useful effects, e.g. an extra life, a better weapon or a shield. There are 32 levels, the goal is achieving a high score and the background story is about a mercenary who takes part in a competition for money and fame.",
