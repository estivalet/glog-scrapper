  "description": "An old-fashioned horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=R-Type\">R-Type</a> vein. Compared to the First-Person Shooters, it might seem quaint, but it's interesting to see this style done using later Amiga hardware capabilities and features.<br><br>There are 3 different ships on offer, as part of a high level of customisability, including an Arcade mode with bonus fruit, variable colour explosions, and variable background detail for those who find that the most colourful version obscures some of the enemies.<br><br>There are two different routes through each level, but either way results in hordes of enemies to take on - horizontally scrolling shooters tend to be tricky, due to the amount of things happening on screen at once. Like so many FPSs but so few scrolling shooters, you can design your own levels as well.",
