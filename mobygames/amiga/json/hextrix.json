  "description": "<i>Hextrix</i> is one of the many <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hextris\">Hextris</a></i> clones that prospered in the years around 1990. It goes without saying that it is a variation upon <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a></i> but with hexagons instead of squares making up the falling pieces. This version has the distinction of being freeware and comes with source code in J-Forth.",
