  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=stealth+fighter\">F-19 Stealth Fighter</a> - take America's premiere stealth fighter out for a spin in several battle areas, including the Persian Gulf, Cuba, and even Vietnam.  There are various scenarios for each, with air-to-air or ground missions, in &quot;cold war&quot; and full-scale war situations.  Players can build up their pilot ranks through completed missions and medals.<br><br>The game actually has two flight modes. In the &quot;authentic&quot; mode, you have only 2 weapon bays, but you have higher stealth rating. In the &quot;theoretical&quot; mode, you have 4 weapon bays like F-19 Stealth Fighter, but your plane is easier to detect due to a lower stealth rating.",
