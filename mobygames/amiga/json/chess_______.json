  "description": "Originally released in source code form to the old USENET group net.sources.games simply as &quot;Chess&quot;, this C language implementation of a chess game has subsequently been christened as <i>SCP</i>, or <i>Stanback Chess Program</i>, after its author <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,52400/\">John Stanback</a>. Even though the source code is short, it plays a competent game, but lacks any kind of graphics due to being written in portable C code. The chess board is displayed as a grid of text characters, with letters representing the different pieces and an asterisk marking the black pieces. Moves are entered in classical chess notation, so that &quot;E2E3&quot; moves the king's pawn forward one square. Other text commands are used to load and save games, flip the board, list moves or get hints.<br><br>Due to its open source nature, <i>SCP</i> has been integrated in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/chess-20\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/terminator-2-judgment-day-chess-wars\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/grandmaster-chess-cd-rom-edition\">games</a>, most notably forming the core of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gnu-chess\">GNU Chess</a></i> from version 2 and until version 5.",
