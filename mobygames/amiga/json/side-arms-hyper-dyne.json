  "description": "Originating in the arcades, <i>Side Arms</i> is a horizontally scrolling shoot ‘em up in which you control Lieutenant Henry (a second player can control Sergeant Sanders in some versions), armed with crude weaponry and protective jump-suits. They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. You must first reach Bozon’s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=1943\">1943</a> and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.",
