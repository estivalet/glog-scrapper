  "description": "<i>Killing Cloud</i> is set in a San Francisco ravaged by an opaque orange death smog layer known as the Killing Cloud. This hovers around the middle of the skyscrapers, creating a claustrophobic low level experience (and a different feel to the many other flight simulations set in the city, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fa-18-interceptor\">F/A-18 Interceptor</a>). <br><br>In this maelstrom, the Black Angel gang is terrorising the public.\nThe player is a member of the SFPD Police force, charged with bringing them down throughout ten missions.  Some are out-and-out action while others are more strategic. You can only survive for 20 minutes in the smog, so time is crucial in these missions.<br><br>In addition to outflying the enemy on your hoverbike, the player must carefully pre-position ground forces to arrest him when he is brought down, using Pick-Up Pods. Once arrested, a suspect must be interrogated to release enough information to know what the next threat is.",
