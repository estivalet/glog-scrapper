  "description": "A rather advanced implementation of the classic &quot;Worm&quot; game for BBSes, Marvin-mask puts the player in the shoes of a worm that runs around in an assortment of (sysop-creatable) mazes in full ANSI colour, eating apples and fat that makes the worm grow. The game is over when the worm collides with itself, the walls, or boulders. Some levels additionally have invisible walls. The worm is controlled using the Z and M keys, thereby turning the worm clockwise or counter-clockwise.",
