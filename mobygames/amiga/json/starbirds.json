  "description": "A horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up from the last days of the basic 68000-powered Amiga. The levels are taller than the screen, so you can move up or down them and take on a selection of the different enemy waves each time.<br><br>At the start of the game you choose your primary and secondary weapon. Pressing fire briefly activates the primary; holding it down activates the secondary - therefore you can't use both at the same time. These can be powered up to various levels, and changed around by picking up tokens, although switching weapon or losing a life reduces your firepower initially. Continues and extra lives are on offer, as are a simultaneous 2-player mode, choice of sounds effects and/or music, and a music test menu.",
