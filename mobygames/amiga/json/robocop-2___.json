  "description": "The Amiga version of <i>RoboCop 2</i> is very similar to other versions of the game released by Ocean Software: it combines platform levels with a puzzle mode and a first-person shooting gallery. While the puzzle and shooting modes are very similar to those on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/robocop-2__\">Atari ST</a>, the main platform sections feature completely different level designs and separate gameplay mechanics.<br><br>All three of the platform stages present RoboCop with a set goal: destroying the Nuke drug lab, apprehending the criminal Cain and finally destroying Cain in his &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; form. On the way to the goals, RoboCop must defeat swarms of henchmen who attack him with guns, mortars and bazookas, and in the last level, various robotic enemies like flying drones and ED-209s. He can shoot back with a standard gun as well as pick up weapon power-ups in the form of cola cans: three-way shot, scatter shot and rapid fire, each with limited but ample ammunition. Other cans enhance the time limit of the level, replenish life energy or provide a temporary shield. Not every power-up should be picked up, however: some have negative effects like reducing the time limit or reversing the controls. <br><br>The large levels feature many elevators, conveyor belts, as well as pipes that leak acid, moving sawblades, crumbling floors and other deadly traps. Each level consists of several parts, with the later parts accessed through doors or holes in the wall that Robo must punch through. In the first two levels there will also be hostages crying for help: rescuing ten of them gains an extra life. Only in the first level, canisters of Nuke can be found. Unlike in other versions, picking them up is mandatory: ten are needed to advance, but more than enough are available.<br><br>After every platform level, a puzzle stage and a shooting gallery follow. In the puzzle stage, RoboCop tries to regain some of his human memories, represented by pictures of his human self Alex Murphy and his wife slowly becoming clearer. To do so, a cursor has to be moved over a circuit board, with the goal of hitting all red chips. Moving the cursor leaves a trail, and neither the trail nor any chips besides the red ones may be hit or the puzzle game is over. Completing four boards in succession (each within less then a minute) leads to extra lives being awarded.<br><br>In the shooting gallery, targets appear in windows and on the street, and a crosshair must be moved to hit them. Accidentally hitting civilians lowers the final score. The second of the two shooting levels takes place at night, with visibility impaired accordingly. Good performance at the gallery improves Robo's accuracy for the following level: enemies take fewer hits to destroy.<br><br>Between levels, digitized images from the film are displayed using the Amiga's HAM graphics mode.",
