  "description": "The world of Light is vanishing... No more glimmer, no more warmth, not even the slightest spark. Only you, Skrull the Barbarian, the incredible bastard son of the unnatural love between the Sun Woman and the Shadow Man, can free the Light again. But the gloomy world of Darkness is full of dangers...<br><br>The game represents a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Barbarian\">Barbarian</a> clone, where you should select the available icon to allow your protagonist seen in third-person side-scrolling view perform the action. Right and left mouse buttons clicks invoke opposite actions. For example, left mouse button click on 'Move Left' icon will move Skrull left, while right mouse button click will move him right. There are seven icons to use: Stop, Move, Run, Jump, Use Sword, Up, Down. Several items may be collected in three inventory slots to be used later. In particular, such item may be a key dropped from dead Dragon to unlock a certain door.<br><br>The environment is labyrinth of dark, damp, and dangerous caves with many obstacles such as gaps to be jumped over and many different enemies such as tarantulas, vampire bats, or dragons. The key to world of Light's salvation lies hidden somewhere here and should be found by you finally.",
