  "description": "In this strip poker game, the player can play with up to three players against one of eight digitized women. Each time a girl loses all her money, she takes off some of her clothes (four of the eight girls feature &quot;movies&quot; of the strip, which consist of half a dozen frames). The game features the possibility to set a preferred language and to turn on or off the girls' comments. It also contains a zoom function.",
