But watch it: to succeed in <i>Energie-Manager</i>, you will have to pay close attention to ecological aspects. Try to win eco prizes, reduce costs with power saving washing machines and water saving toilets.<br><br>The game was published by German federal authorities in the early nineties to teach children about eco-conscious business behaviour and has been distributed for free since then.",
