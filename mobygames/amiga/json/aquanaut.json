  "description": "This side-view shoot ‘em up scrolls in multiple directions, moving it away from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=R-Type\">R-Type</a> game style and more towards <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Blood+Money\">Blood Money</a>. Most of the danger comes from wall mountings or static obstacles rather than actual sentient opposition. The levels are large and multi-directional, with a map feature to help you progress through each one. Power up weapons can be collected. The gameplay is quite systematic, with a measured approach working better than a gung-ho ‘shoot first, ask questions later’ mentality.",
