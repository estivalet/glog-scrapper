  "description": "This game could easily be disregarded as just yet another Scorched Earth clone. But with the improved graphics and sound offered by the Amiga, and a huge array of weapons to buy, it's an excellent game in its own right.\n<br>Up to 4 players can battle it out against each other, or computer opponents, through multiple rounds. Players earn money by damaging each other, which they can then spend on weapons and shields between each round.",
