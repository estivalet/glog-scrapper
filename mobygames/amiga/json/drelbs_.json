  "description": "In <i>Drelbs</i>, a set of randomly-arranged lines are already in place on the screen, and moving your character into contact with them pushes them in the direction of contact. Forming a complete square locks it into place, and it turns into a barrier. After a certain period of time, a monster may appear in a barrier which results in death if you make contact with it. After a little while the monster disappears taking the barrier with it. <br><br>After producing enough squares/barriers, one will randomly change into a stairway, which can lead you into a bonus room. Making things harder are the enemies which chase your character around the screen, again contact with these results in death.<br><br>This game is a free remake of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Drelbs\">Commodore 64 game</a> of the same name.",
