  "description": "<i>Conflict: Middle East</i> is a detailed wargame/simulation of the Arab/Israeli Wars from 1973 until the present (1991). The action is historical and hypothetical. You can fight the entire 1973 Arab/Israeli conflict on an operational level as the Israelis or take on the more daunting task of the Arab forces. Choose the hypothetical 1990's scenario for modern day desert warfare. The game is fought at the Brigade/Division level where you will control every detail of land and air war down to the individual infantry squads, vehicles and gun tubes. You must also keep track of weather, supplies, and politics as they will impact many of your options.",
