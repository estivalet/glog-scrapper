  "description": "In <i>Thunder Boy</i> the player takes the role of Julian, whose girlfriend Jane was kidnapped by the fire dragon Drago. The reason: They rebelled when Drago took over their homeland. Julian's goal is to rescue Jane.<br><br>This game is a side-scrolling platformer similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wonder-boy\">Wonder Boy</a>. The player walks from left to right while evading the enemies. Touching those drains Julian's life energy (reaching zero results in a life loss) - but so does starving. He has to pick up fruits to avoid this happening. Initially Julian can't attack the enemies, but after a while he finds an axe. The game features 20 levels.",
