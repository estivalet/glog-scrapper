  "description": "<em>Dawn: A New Beginning</em> is a freeware RPG for the Amiga similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dungeon-master\">Dungeon Master</a>. The game allows the player to choose between 4 robot characters with different attributes. Once one of them is selected, the player has to pick one of the missions available. The main objective of each mission is to collect money to upgrade the characters' statistics. The far left of the screen is occupied with icon boxes: The <b>speaker</b> turns the sound effects on/off. The <b>arrow</b> turns the scrolling on/off (when it's on, rotating makes the screen scroll in the selected\ndirection). The <b>question mark</b> shows characters stats (energy and food levels) and amount of cash. The <b>cross</b> is the quit option.<br><br>Movement is performed by clicking the six direction arrows below the display window, or by using the keyboard. Below the arrows are two hands. To use a weapon or object the player has to place them on these hands and click them. Besides each hand is an ammunition counter.<br><br>Right-clicking brings up the inventory screen with twelve slots for guns, ammunition, food and other objects. To the right of these slots there are 4 boxes. The <b>hourglass</b> pauses the game. The <b>ZZ</b> makes the character sleep to regain points. The <b>use</b> box makes the character use whatever he is carrying (food items are consumed, for example). The empty box is where armor has to be placed.<br><br>Doors are opened by clicking on them. The shop is accessed by clicking in the small screen at the top of it. Items for sale can be scrolled using the direction arrows. Gems and honey (found in boxes around the game map) can be sold for profit.<br><br>There are two types of combat, long range and short range. Short range weapons include knifes and swords while long range weapons\ninclude pistols and rocket launchers. In short range combat the enemy has to be standing close. In long range combat the enemy can be anywhere in the line of fire.<br><br>The game can be saved between missions on the main menu.",
