Players are awarded points based on casualties and territorial objectives. At the end of each turn and the end of the game points are calculated and compared to a chart which determines your level of victory. The game can be played under 3 different sets of rules (Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced) and can be played against another person or the computer can play either side.",
