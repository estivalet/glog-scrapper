  "description": "The first <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rise-of-the-rabbits\">Rise of the Rabbits</a></i> was a <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dynablaster\">Dynablaster</a></i> clone, but the second game is a simple platformer inspired by <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a></i><br><br>You guide your little rabbit, using the joystick button to jump (rather unorthodox for an Amiga game) across the side-scrolling landscape, jumping on baddies such as mushrooms and butterflies. You have a lot of inertia and can remain suspended for quite a long time compared to Mario, but jumps also require more precision since the main sprite is rather big compared to the background blocks.<br><br>The game has very little variation in the background blocks, since it is was made to fit in only 32 kilobytes, for the 32k games coding contest at the Mekka &amp; Symposium demoparty, where the same team also released <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/a-type\">A-Type</a></i>.",
