  "description": "<i>Team Suzuki</i> uses official support to simulate motorcycle racing using polygon graphics. The action is viewed from the cockpit. Contact with other bikes or the scenery gradually increases the damage percentage, which will eliminate you at 100%. Crashing results in an external replay of your final moments.<br><br>Joystick and mouse control options exist, with the mouse being ultimately faster but harder to learn. 125, 250 and 500cc options exist, with the difficulty higher on the more powerful bikes. You can contest a full season, single race, or simply practice on a free track. <br><br>16 circuits are featured, from Suzuka and Misano to Rijeka and Philip Island, with races over 5-50 laps. Your opponents are seven factory Suzuki riders from various classes at the time, including 1993 500cc World Champion Kevin Schwantz.",
