  "description": "<i>A.G.E.</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=galactic+empire\">Galactic Empire</a>. Like its predecessor, it is a  first-person space exploration game rendered in 3D. As you pilot your spacecraft around the planets and stars, engaging in space combat and conversation with other characters, you unravel the Conquer the Universe plot. The game is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=elite\">Elite</a> in that you are relatively free to travel to wherever you please.",
