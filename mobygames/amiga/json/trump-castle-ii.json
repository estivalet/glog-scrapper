While playing one of the six games -  Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, Slots, Poker, and Craps - you also may explore the Trump Castle's apartments, converse with its inhabitants, and even read the &quot;Castle Courier&quot; newspaper. <br><br>The game allows up to four players and may be saved in progress. The gameplay is directed on winning as much money as you can making the bets based on the combination of your luck and the theory of probability. You may be a millionaire.<br><br>The CGA version of the game allows only to play the casino games without exploring the Trump Castle.",
