  "description": "<i>TeleWar II</i> is the sequel to the original <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/telewar\">TeleWar</a></i>, a two-player strategy game intended to be played via modem, alternatively taking turns at a single computer.<br><br>Two armies (the blue one and the red one) confront each other on a scrolling battle field, controlled entirely by mouse. The basic game is the same as the predecessor, but with new terrains and scenarios and updates to the engine.<br><br>The game is finished once the enemy army is destroyed, if a player cedes the game, or if the flag is captured. <br><br>A follow-up, <i>TeleWar III</i> was announced but never published, but the game was further refined into <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Operation+Com%e2%80%a2Bat\">Operation Com•Bat</a></i>, which for the first time added artificial intelligence, making one-player games possible as well.",
