  "description": "<i>Delta Patrol</i> is a side scrolling shoot 'em up similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Defender\">Defender</a> where the player takes control of the last surviving member of the titular Delta Patrol who has to do all he can to combat the various kinds of aliens that appear from the sky. Like in Defender it's possible to move both left and right and a radar at the top of the screen shows where the alien attacks are happening. In addition to blasting away the aliens, the player's objective is to protect the refuelling stations at the ground since the helicopter's fuel level will drop to zero and explode if not refuelled at times. To help there is a man in a buggy that races across the surface and rebuilds the gas stations. The game goes on until all the player's lives are lost and more dangerous enemies appear the long the player manages to survive.",
