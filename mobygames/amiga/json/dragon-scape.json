The peace has been disturbed by the evil King of Kaos who has to be defeated. The protagonist has to ride a dragon, find 40 artifacts and bring them to the corresponding places. The artifacts can only be dropped at the correct location.<br><br>Of course there are enemies which try to stop the player and can be destroyed by using the dragon's fire breath. Besides the artifact collecting, the game plays out as a traditional multi-directional scrolling shooter. There are five levels with eight artifacts each. ",
