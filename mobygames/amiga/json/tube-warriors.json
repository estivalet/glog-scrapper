  "description": "<em>Tube Warriors</em> is a versus fighting game exclusive to AGA-based Amigas. It is set in a Japanese undergound network, where each station and its surrounding area are controlled by a local street gang. The player must defeat the leaders of all the rival gangs and take over their territories, working their way up to Kyosci, the &quot;King of the tubes&quot;. Gang leaders include: Kenju, a martial artist; Mitzuko, the only female gang leader; Mako, a baseball player; Ghork, a street punk; Satoru, a sumo fighter; Ranza, a restaurant chef; and Robby, a kid controlling a robot similarly to Baby Head from <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/captain-commando\">Captain Commando</a></em>. Initially only Kenju is selectable in single player mode, however every street thug joins the player's gang once defeated and becomes selectable from that moment on.<br><br>The basic control scheme is very similar to that of <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/body-blows\">Body Blows</a></em>, in that most attacks, as well as blocking, are performed by moving the joystick in one of the eight directions with the fire button pressed, with one special attack requiring the player to hold the fire button while remaining still. Another gameplay feature, this time lifted from <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fatal-fury\">Fatal Fury</a></em>, is the ability to jump between the foreground and the background, with the sprites being considerably scaled down in the latter case.<br><br>A competitive two-player mode is also available, allowing each player to choose from all the fighters including Kyosci. Matches can be fought in best-of-three or best-of-five, though these options are only accessible at the beginning and selecting another mode requires a reboot.\n",
