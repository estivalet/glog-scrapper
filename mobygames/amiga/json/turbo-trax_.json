  "description": "<i>Turbo Trax</i> is a racing game which tries to bring the feeling of electric car races to the computer. The courses feature elements from the toys like crossovers or chicanes, along with a pit stop which can be used to repair damage or refuel. However, the gameplay is action oriented with the main challenge to avoid going too fast into curves. <br><br>There are two playing modes: racing against the AI (or another player) or a time trial. The game features five courses and an editor to create more.",
