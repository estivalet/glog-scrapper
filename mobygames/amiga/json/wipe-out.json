  "description": "<i>Wipe-Out</i> is a light cycle game with hover boards. The gameplay itself is simple: two players (the second either AI or human) race in a closed off area and both leave behind an energy trail. However crashes into the walls or an energy trail loses the match. Random appearing power ups give advantages if picked up, e.g. going through the opponent's trail. The camera is placed behind the shoulder and the screen is always split.<br><br>This is all embedded in leagues on different planets. The ultimate goal is to get better and better until the player is invited to an ultimate championship with a great prize. Between matches, the player can upgrade the hoverboard, e.g. adding brakes or a better engine, or bet on the outcome of AI matches. All planets have a difficulty rating which influences the rewarded fame and money for winning.",
