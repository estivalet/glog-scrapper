  "description": "<em>Tex</em> is an Italian comic book series created in 1948 by Gian Luigi Bonelli and Aurelio Galeppini. In this video game adaptation, the player controls Tex Willer, a ranger in the Old West and the main character in the series. Tex is alerted of trouble brewing in the nearby city of Cortez, which is quickly transforming into a ghost town. He then travels to Cortez to find out that a gang of thugs have been driving the townspeople away, and must uncover and thwart the sinister plot behind these raids.<br><br><em>Tex: Piombo Caldo</em> (Burning Lead) is an action adventure game combining exploration and multiple-choice interfaces, a gameplay style that would soon thereafter become a mainstay of Simulmondo's episodic game production. During the exploration sections, Tex wanders through maze-like locations and must defeat enemies, including hostile Apaches and bandits, using his bare hands or his pistol. Other sections are shown through static screens with either clickable items or a menu of possible actions. Both sections feature multiple-choice dialogue with NPCs.<br><br>The story is divided into two chapters that can be played separately.",
