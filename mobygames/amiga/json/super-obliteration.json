  "description": "Thirty levels of boulder-blasting await in this platform shoot ‘em up, which can be thought of as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/buster-bros\">Pang</a> meets <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/turrican\">Turrican</a>. The levels start with varying amounts of boulders, and as soon as you shoot at one of them, it breaks up into 2 more which are half the size. Eventually they become small enough that they disappear. <br><br>Your character is a human sprite, so you’re bound to the ground unless you can jump onto one of the strategically-placed ledges. There are several different weapons available, which you don’t lose when you die.<br><br>There are numerous different control options – the standard one involves always firing in the direction you’re aiming, but others include one where your firing direction can be changed by flicking the joystick with fire held down, an option where you move using the main 4 directions and use the bottom-left and bottom-right diagonal to rotate the firing direction, and an option where you use one joystick for direction of movement, and the other for direction of fire. \n",
