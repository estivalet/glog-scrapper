  "description": "<i>Sensible World of Soccer '96/'97</i> is an updated version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sensible-world-of-soccer-european-championship-edition\">Sensible World of Soccer: European Championship Edition</a>. The only addition are the updated team rosters.<br><br>While the Linux/Macintosh/Windows are just the emulated DOS version, the Xbox 360 has some genuine changes: online multiplayer, updated graphics (the graphical style and the top-down perspective are kept) and dynamic advertisements. The team rosters are still based on season 1996/1997, but the names are not authentic anymore.",
