  "description": "Without any substantial background story or colourful characters to back it up, Flyin' High is all about racing.<br><br>One of the few fully 3D racing games on the Amiga, you must race your car on 20 tracks divided into four worlds; city, forest, jungle and arctic. Spread out on the tracks are not only obstacles, but also money which must be picked up so that you may mend or upgrade your car between the races. If the computer drivers are not interesting enough for you, you and three of your friends may race simultaneously in split-screen mode. Apart from tyre and engine upgrades, you also have a limited weapons arsenal to slow down the competition.",
