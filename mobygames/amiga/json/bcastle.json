  "description": "A compilation of three solitaire card games: <i>Beleaguered castle, Citadel</i> and <i>Streets and alleys</i>. All three are variations on the same theme, with eight shuffled stacks of cards surrounding three pads where cards of the same colour must be stacked from the ace and upwards.<br><br>The game runs in an AmigaOS window and is multitasking-friendly. To speed up graphics, moving cards are rendered not in full size, but as a small icon. The pull-down menus let you find a specific card in the stacks, show all remaining moves, undo moves or enter the cheat mode.",
