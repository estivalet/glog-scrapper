  "description": "<i>Rexoban</i> is a <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/soko-ban\">Sokoban</a></i> clone written in ARexx, the standard scripting and interprocess communications language of AmigaOS. It runs in a small window with simple ASCII graphics and is controlled using the cursor keys. Since it is mainly a proof-of-concept, only three levels are included, but since ARexx is an interpreted language, anyone is free to add more puzzles to the code.",
