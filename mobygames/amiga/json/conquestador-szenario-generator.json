  "description": "<i>Conquestador: Szenario Generator</i> is an add-on for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/spoils-of-war\">Spoils of War</a>. It adds a construction set which can be used to create new maps and landscapes. Besides the usual option to hand-build everything, the player may also choose to random-generate parts of the world and tweak it afterwards. <br><br>Also on the disk are nine scenarios which are modeled after real or fictional landscapes, e.g. North America, Africa of Aventuria. Additionally included is a patch for the main game (applied to copies of the original disks).",
