  "description": "A simple little game that is a later reworking of the ancient game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/thrust\">Thrust</a>. With the full effects of gravity and Newtonian physics in action to make control more challenging, you fly around a side-scrolling level shooting enemies and avoiding contact with the scenery.<br><br>There are a few additional twists. You must collect bits of a key (which you need to be able to kill the baddie at the end), and pick up prisoners (whom you can then torture to learn the whereabouts of other bits of the key). There's also a shop where you can sell your prisoners as slaves (provided you haven't tortured them to death) in return for powerups for your ship.",
