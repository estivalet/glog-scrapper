  "description": "<i>ATR: All Terrain Racing</i> is an overhead racing game from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Team17+Software+Limited\">Team 17</a> featuring 42 tracks on six types of terrain: snow, forest, sport track (base type to select from) and space, moon and alien (to be unlocked by the game's progress). The graphics are overhead view and scrolling, with a forced perspective nature. Most levels have long and short ways round, which adds a hint of navigation and strategy to the proceedings. Unlike the company’s earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Overdrive\">Overdrive</a>, there is a variety of corners, rather than just 90-degree ones. A variety of power-ups and advancements are on offer as well as three different types of vehicles (4x4, buggy and formula) that has its pros and cons depending on the terrain they are used. The game can be played in three modes: arcade, battle and league. Arcade mode gives a single player the possibility to race on 3 tracks in each type of terrain giving the possibility to play different tracks each time you start the game. Battle mode is a multiplayer option with introduction of missiles and mines - the players try to obtain as many points as possible by shooting other players or making the screen to catch other players' vehicles. The last one - league mode - is pretty much similar to the battle mode but without missiles. Players collect points by catching other players' vehicles by the screen or by collecting special items.",
