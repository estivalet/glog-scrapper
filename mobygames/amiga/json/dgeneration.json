  "description": "Something has gone horribly wrong at Genoq Biolabs, Singapore. You're just a courier, sent to the building to deliver a package. Now you're trapped inside, the security system has gone crazy, genetically engineered organisms are on the rampage and things look like they could get even worse...<br><br>Make your way through 10 floors of isometric action and puzzles, trying to stay alive and discover what's going on. Talk to and rescue survivors, pick up armaments and log into computer terminals. What caused the Genoq disaster? What's inside thevital package you've got to deliver? What is the <i>D/Generation</i>? And what is really waiting for you on the top floor of the building?<br><br>The Windows, Macintosh and Xbox One HD versions have additional features: high res graphics, new music, a new control menu, the ability to save anywhere and support for leaderboards and achievements.",
