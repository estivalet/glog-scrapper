  "description": "<i>Uropa²</i> is a mix of futuristic adventure and simulation game. As a Tekite warrior you will undertake different missions on Uropa² - one of Jupiter's moons. The main part of the game takes place in different bases presented in isometric view where your prime goal is to rescue the colonists and all Kapone Commanders. <br><br>You can repair and access computer terminals, download information, purchase equipment, ammunition and up to 8 different weapons. Between bases you travel using Hovar vehicles equipped with lasers and missiles that will help you to destroy enemy Hovars. <br><br>The game is available in ten languages and contains full in-game digital speech. A special game mode - Hovar Wars - enables two player battles (via serial link). In 1996 the game was released as shareware and a year later as full commercial game under Vulcan Software's aegis.",
