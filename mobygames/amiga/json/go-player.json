  "description": "<i>Go Player</i> is a computer adaption of the old board game <i>Go</i> which is most often played in Eastern Asia. The basic principle is that two players (one white, the other black) place stones on a 19x19 board. The goal is to control as big as possible areas on the board by circling it with own stones. Likewise, enemy stones can be taken out of the game by circling them. At the end of the match (when both players pass their turn) the size of controlled areas and the taken out stones determine the winner.<br><br>This game features two smaller boards (9x9 and 13x13) and handicap options, both adapted from real-life rule adaptions. There are also 101 difficulty levels and the option to pre-define the board to practice special match situations.",
