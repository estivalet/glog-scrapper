  "description": "You awake in prison, without the memory of who you are, where you are and why you are imprisoned. In the corner of your cell you find a briefcase computer, which gives you the control over a unit of four droids. Now you must use these droids to find yourself, and free yourself. <br><br><i>Captive</i> has a sci-fi setting, but resembles more a fantasy RPGs with robots and droids. With the help of the droids you explore tech-dungeons and seek information, which leads to the next planet(s) on a path, the end of which is your cell.<br><br>The movement and fighting is similar to games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Eye+of+the+Beholder\">Eye of the Beholder</a>, but you can buy droid parts in shops beside the usual weapons and items. The droids haven't levels like in &quot;normal&quot; role-playing games; you must buy upgrades for the different parts of the droids, which make them stronger and faster. You can also buy a variety of chips, which allow the droids to see in darkness, invert the gravity or simple to shield a little period of time.",
