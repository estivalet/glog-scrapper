  "description": "<i>PuzzleBOBS</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puzzle+Bobble\">Puzzle Bobble</a> variant for one or two players. As in the original arcade game, the player controls a pointer and has to shoot at the balls above him. By creating clusters of three or more balls of the same kind the balls are removed. When they have all been removed the player moves on to the next level. The player can't plan ahead for too long since there is a time limit between shots and when it reaches zero the ball is automatically launched. The game is made harder by the ceiling that continuously descends toward the player. The game ends when balls reaches the bottom line of the playing field. <br><br>In addition to the normal mode which is for one player only there are also two multiplayer modes for two players (although they can also be played against an AI). One is cooperative and features two pointers on the same screen where both players attack the same balls. The other is competitive where each player has its own playing field and the one who first clears the level wins.<br><br>The game is highly configurable and can be played on a large array of computers from low (320x200) to very high resolutions (1280x512). Almost everything in the game can be modified from graphics to sound, AI and behaviour of balls. The game also features multi tasking and can be played either in full screen, in a window or in a PIP. New level sets can also be created by altering config files. There are two different level sets included with the game: one with faces and one with flags.",
