  "description": "One of the numerous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Doom\">Doom</a> style games for the Amiga in the mid 90s. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gloom\">Gloom</a>, it was published by Guildhall Leisure, who gave the Amiga a lot of time in that era.<br><br>Fears took the approach of having full-screen, though relatively low-resolution, graphics. The level landscapes feature lots of stairways and lifts, giving it a pseudo-3D feel. The game is played across 30 levels, with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.",
