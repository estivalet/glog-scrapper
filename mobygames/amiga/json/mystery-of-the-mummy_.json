  "description": "<i>Mystery of the Mummy</i> is set in the Hamburg of 1912 and the player takes the role of a detective. Along with his companion Wilhelm, he has to solve a case revolving around a mummy and its alleged curse. After one week, his superior will show up and only if the player can present his case (answering the questions correctly and having evidence) the game is won.<br><br>This game is an icon-driven adventure game based on actual detective work: most of the time is spent analyzing clues and talking to people. There are no traditional puzzles to be found besides figuring out which of the 186 locations to visit next (there is no linear progression and the player is free to choose the next steps) and how to convince people to help. However, the game includes various chores from real life, e.g. the need to sleep and eat or to fill up on gas. There is no special skill needed for those tasks, but they eat up money and time. <br><br>There are also two action-based minigames which involve driving and processing evidence in the lab.",
