  "description": "Despite the name conjuring up images of a cutesy platform creature, your charge in this game is in fact a helicopter armed to the teeth. The game requires at least a 68020 processor, which is understandable considering the amount of action going on at times, and the speed and visual detail this is conveyed in. It was one of the few Amiga games to include a Virtual Cockpit mode, and this can be controlled using the mouse with a quick button press.<br><br>The game’s missions are set up in such a way that you are not necessarily the lead man. The two sides fight each other irrespective of your placement, and act on instinct with unusually complex AI, meaning that the exact nature of the missions vary each time you play. The missions all involve shooting at the enemy planes, helicopters and tanks though, and there is no particular war structure in terms of the mission orders\n",
