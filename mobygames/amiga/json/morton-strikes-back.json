  "description": "This platform game sees the player control Morton, and have to guide him through levels to reach the end of the game. The game has a 'dispensable plot' in which Morton must complete the game in order to prove himself to his parents. Variations on the standard platform levels include underwater levels, and 'rescue the penguins' where penguins follow Morton and he must guide them safely to the exit. Morton can kill most bad guys by jumping on them, but some have spikes on their back to prevent this. Extra points can be earned by collecting fruit which is scattered around the levels. There are four different difficulty modes, which allow the players to progress through a variety from a total of 80 levels.",
