  "description": "<i>Titano</i> is a very similar game to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ishido%3a+The+Way+of+Stones\">Ishido: The Way of Stones</a>. The player has a playfield with a 12x8 grid and 72 stones which differ in their symbol and colour. There are always two stones which are exactly the same. At the start of the game one stone is set on the playfield and one other is randomly taken from the pile. Every taken stone can only be placed besides another stone which also needs to match in either colour or symbol with all bordering stones (this is the main difference to <i>Ishido</i>). Better matches bring more points which are lost again if an unusable stone is put into the pile again. If the player tries to place the stone wrongly, special stones appear which put away a stone or decrease the score.",
