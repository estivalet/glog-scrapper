  "description": "<i>Hexagons</i> is a variation on <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hextris\">Hextris</a></i> with some additional bells and whistles.<br><br>In addition to the standard mode, there is an &quot;arcade&quot; mode, where you start up with some of the playfield already filled with dropped blocks to eliminate. In addition to the ten &quot;standard&quot; Hextris blocks, there is an optional set of non-standard blocks, many of which contain spaces which makes filling a line even more difficult.<br><br>The game is system-friendly, running in a window on the Workbench screen, and adapts itself to the screen mode used, using dithering to simulate colours if a screen with only four or eight colours is used, and adapting the graphics to the current aspect ratio.",
