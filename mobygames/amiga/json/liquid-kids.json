  "description": "In <i>Mizubaku Daibouken</i>, you play Hipopo the Hippopotamus who must venture through a large number of enemy-packed levels in search for his missing girlfriend, as well as rescuing other hippo-like creatures along the way. The game features moving platforms, collapsible floors, boats, water-wheels, and plants that can be watered, causing them to grow and allowing you to reach much higher platforms.<br><br>Hipopo is supplied with magical water globes, which can be thrown at enemies to freeze them. Once frozen, the enemies can be kicked and destroyed completely. If idle for a few seconds, enemies will unfreeze themselves and continue their business. Every two levels is a boss that needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next one.\n",
