  "description": "<i>Generic Adventure 551</i> is a version of the classic interactive fiction game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Adventure\">Adventure</a> (also known as <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>). It is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Dave+Long\">Dave Long</a>'s 350 point Fortran version (1978) which was later (around 1984) expanded to 551 points by different authors The code was later touched by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Doug+McDonald\">Doug McDonald</a> so it could be compiled with Fortran translation tools and released to the Usenet in August 1990. His code was then ported to other platforms.<br><br>The basic content does not differ from the original: the player searches a mysterious cave for treasure. This requires exploring the environment and solving puzzles by typing in commands into a parser. The DOS port adds the ability to save the game to different files and the Amiga ports has a different front-end.",
