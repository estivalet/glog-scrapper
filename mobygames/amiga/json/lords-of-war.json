  "description": "<i>Lords of War</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/warlords_\">Warlords</a> variant in a medieval setting. The kingdom is threatened by a dragon and in course to detect the best knight, they have to go to war between each other. In result, a skull bounces around four knight's castle walls. A castle stone vaporizes if it is hit and the big goal is to hit the shield which is inside the opponent's wall. To prevent the destruction of the own wall, the player uses a shield, which can be moved around the two vulnerable walls, to reflect the skull back. However, from time to the skull starts to glow and then it rewards spell points if caught. With those points the player can cast twelve magic spells ranging from more speed to a complete castle destruction. There are 20 levels and a two-player option with two AI opponents.",
