  "description": "<i>Quasar Wars</i> is a special kind of shoot 'em up because even if you will control a spaceship, here you will have complete freedom of movements (Thunder Force 1-like) unlike other games in which the scroll constantly &quot;pushes&quot; you to the right or to the top of the screen. To finish the game you will have to complete 16 missions spread over three worlds. But then again, not all of them will be the typical &quot;kill them all&quot; kind of missions you see in most shooters, since sometimes these will just be about recollecting certain number of capsules, or planting a bomb somewhere in the map. Of course, there will also be missions in which you have to kill everything that moves. Between missions, you can also select the items to equip on your spaceship or the weapons to use.",
