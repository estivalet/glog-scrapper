  "description": "Aliens threaten to destroy the earth via a huge bomb embedded deep within the planet.  As a challenge to the human race, they have agreed to let Earth's finest pilot to get into a high-speed ship to get to the bomb before the timer runs out.  <br><br>Your ship has minimal shields to protect you from slamming into walls as you navigate the deep underground tunnels.  But it's not easy:  You'll have no idea which tunnels are the fastest/shortest until a split second before you get to them, and there are alien weapons trying to destroy you along the way.<br><br>If you manage to complete the run and save the earth, you can tell the program to randomly generate an entirely new game with different tunnels for endless replayability.",
