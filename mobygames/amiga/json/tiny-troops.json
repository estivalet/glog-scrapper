  "description": "<i>On planet Agaris IV, two races fight for power on an endless war. When the Klutes and the Furfurians' dispute made their planet inhospitable, they needed a new battleground. Their troops where teleported to planet Earth, where everything, they discover, is 100 times bigger. Their battles are thus a small event there, taking place out of the attention of the humans.</i><br><br><b>Tiny Troops</b> is a real-time strategy game, with gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cannon-fodder\">Cannon Fodder</a>. It supports up to 2 players in split-screen mode, and mouse or joystick control. Before starting a level, a screen is shown where the player must select which units are going to be on his troop. There's several types of units (foot soldiers, grenadiers, etc). Clicking the general gives a hint and the main objective of the level (that usually is about killing the enemy and destroying their base). Most of the main game screen is occupied by a scrolling map of the level, with the bottom portion reserved for the control windows (one for the mini-map, other for game options like saving and restarting, a third for unit commands and a final one with unit information or a list of group formations). The player controls the soldiers by clicking on them and selecting orders icons from the command window:<br><br>- a <b>fist icon</b> is to attack;<br><br>- an <b>upward arrow</b> to select the route;<br><br>- a <b>wrench</b> to repair things;<br><br>- a <b>shield</b> to stand guard;<br><br>- a <b>target</b> to surround the unit.<br><br>The game has 65 levels spread on a variety of different terrains (garden, kitchen, etc).",
