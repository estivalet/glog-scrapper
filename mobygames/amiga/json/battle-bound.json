  "description": "<i>Battle Bound</i> is a side scrolling beat 'em up where the player takes control of Calumn the Mighty who after saving Lady Charlotte has to go and conquer the lair of a horrific golem. But to get there he has to move through the graveyard of the beast which is inhabited by barbarous nomads and cross the bridge of fire which is guarded by dragon men. Calumn is equipped with an axe that he can throw at enemies or he can choose to punch them in a melee fight. For smaller enemies such as the crawling slugs a kick is needed. By destroying slugs it's possible to obtain different tokens. Red ones re-energizes, blue ones gives a power up, green ones give invulnerability and yellow ones give extra lives. In addition to all the enemies Calumn also has to avoid drowning in quicksand.",
