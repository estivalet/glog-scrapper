  "description": "<i>Willy's Weirdy Nightmare</i> is a &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; clone for the Amiga, created in AMOS. The game uses joystick controls and has a savegame feature that can be used by pressing the S key.<br><br>The plot of the game is a little different to the original JSW, but the gameplay is practically identical. The hero Willy is fast asleep and trapped in a nightmare about his enormous mansion being full of monsters, and must collect a large number of magical items before he can wake up. The first room shows Willy both simultaneously asleep in bed, and as a ghostly white figure walking around the room, like an astral projection. (This explains why Willy's sprite is still a solid-white figure, as in the original ZX Spectrum game, even though every other sprite is now more detailed and colorful.)<br><br>Magical items are always identified by changing color rapidly. Almost anything that moves can harm Willy, and so can some static elements, like spikes and skulls. Staircases are depicted as diagonal lines of pixels, and Willy will automatically start climbing a staircase if he walks onto it, but if you jump as you approach a staircase he will pass through it instead. There are also conveyor belts that move Willy in a certain direction, false walls hiding the entrance to secret rooms, and switches that change the state of the world in some way.",
