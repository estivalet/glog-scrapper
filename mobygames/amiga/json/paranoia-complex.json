  "description": "<i>The Paranoia Complex</i> takes place in a city controlled by a rogue computer which has its dictatorial grasp over it. The player takes the role of a citizen who has the dirty job to hunt down terrorist rebels. This simply plays out that the computer gives instructions, the player walks to the terrorist in the top-down city and shoots him. After collecting a disk from the body and bringing it to a special terminal, money and promotions wait as reward.<br><br>Money is essential because it is used to buy things like weapons, ammo or food. In regular intervals, the player has to take a personality test with yes/no answers and questions like &quot;Are you a fascist pig?&quot;. Failing to answer correctly causes the player to become the hunted instead of the hunter.",
