  "description": "Not the most complex game in the world, Infiltrator is a two player action game. Each player controls a cube (one is red, the other blue) and the game is played out on the slippery floor of an arena, with a goal at either end and a line halfway through. The aim is to reach your opponent's goal without making contact with him. If there is contact, the point goes to the player whose half the contact took place in. This makes for a lot of dodging around, weighing up whether to make a mad dash for the goal, or to simply wait for a better opening without taking an immediate risk.",
