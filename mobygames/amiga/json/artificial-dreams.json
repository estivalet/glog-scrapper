  "description": "This slow-paced methodical shoot 'em up is viewed from top down, with your ship flying up the screen. The game's levels have a clearly square design to them, with lots of barriers to negotiate as well as aliens (which generally stay in the same vertical plane as they fly towards you).<br><br>Many squares featuring a variety of power-up type effects, such as improved weaponry, extra lives, a level warp, a device to stop the landscape's (otherwise constant) scrolling (thereby giving you a chance to 'pick off' the aliens more carefully), and one which speeds up the aliens (avoid this!). You can move backwards a short way, but it takes a few squares' worth of screen to get fully across the screen, so bear this in mind in the mazier sections.",
