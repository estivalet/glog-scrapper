  "description": "<i>Tetrix</i> is a clone of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a></i> for the Amiga. It runs in a set of windows on an 8-colour OS screen or on the standard Workbench screen, and multitasks. The graphics are simple, but it has statistics over each type of block dropped and a preview of the next block. There are 15 difficulty levels — the higher the difficulty, the more of the screen is filled with blocks when the game starts. When a new game is started, you may choose to use the exact same sequence of blocks as in the previous game, a handy feature for setting up tournaments where every player is given the same chances. Control is via the numeric keypad.",
