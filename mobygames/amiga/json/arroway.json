  "description": "<i>Arroway</i> puts a certain spin on the classic sliding puzzle. The board consists of sliding tiles, each of which features an arrow. Clicking the tile turns the arrow around, and if three arrows in a row point in the same direction, they are eliminated. Due to the interlocking nature of the arrows, it is rarely possible to eliminate all tiles just by turning the arrows, forcing you to start sliding the tiles around. As the game progresses, bonus crystals appear on the board, and can be taken only by sliding the empty tile into them.",
