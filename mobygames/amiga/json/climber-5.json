This plays out rather like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=076930024713\">Donkey Kong</a><br><br>You begin in the bottom right or bottom center and must make your way, via ladders, to the top left to retrieve a ball. Avoid moving obstacles however you can. Be careful you do not touch an obstacle or you will lose a life and be returned to your starting point. When you get the ball, you move on to the next level.",
