  "description": "<i>Escape from Hammy Town</i> is a point &amp; click graphic adventure. As the game begins, the main character has just emerged unharmed from the wreckage of a car, after veering off the road and crashing into a tree on the outskirts of an unfamiliar town. Our hero has almost no money, the car isn't going anywhere, and so the only option is to head into town and find some alternative way to get back on the road...<br><br>The game interface splits the screen vertically: the current scene is shown from a third-person perspective, while underneath is an action panel that displays the inventory items you are carrying, along with nine action buttons (&quot;Give&quot;, &quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;Use&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Close&quot;, &quot;Talk to&quot;, &quot;Look at&quot;, &quot;Push&quot; and &quot;Pull&quot;) for manipulating objects and interacting with characters.",
