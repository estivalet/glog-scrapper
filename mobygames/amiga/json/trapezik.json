  "description": "<i>Trapezik</i> is a recreational puzzle game where you make trapezes. The game window consists of six concentric squares, between which sit small diagonal lines. A click of the mouse flips the line back and forth, and your task is to click these so that the maximum number of trapezes is created. To complicate matters, some diagonals will flip at random, making the game more of a challenge and less of a plain mechanical clicking contest.",
