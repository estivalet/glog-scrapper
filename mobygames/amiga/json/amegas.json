  "description": "<i>Amegas</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a> variant which conforms to, and expands on the play mechanics of the established <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a> canon. <br><br>The basic lay remains to control a bat which slides back and forth at the bottom of the screen. Stacks of coloured bricks are arranged in patterns above. The object is being to bounce a ball to hit the bricks to make them disappear. Some bricks’ require multiple hits to destroy - visually indicated by dots shown on the face.  Some special bricks are distinguished from others by unique icons, e.g. one with a’ skull’ will result in a loss of life if hit by the ball, or one with an ‘x’ mark will cause new bricks to spawn &amp; spread.  <br><br>At times bricks will yield colour-coded pickups which topple down and may be caught, resulting in a special power-up feature being given. A unique play facet presented here is that power-ups’ are not activated automatically, but rather are reserved - The player may utilise the last power-up collected upon clicking the right mouse button, this remains true even if a ball is lost.",
