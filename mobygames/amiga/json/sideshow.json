  "description": "This is the third light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga.  It is a collection of eight arcade-style games that take place at a carnival.  The scenario is that the player arrives at the carnival and has tokens to play the various mini-games.  These mini-games include shooting balloons, throwing knives at a clown, the water dunk tank, the haunted hill, shooting balls, a hammer strength test, and the clock shoppe.<br><br>This was one of the first video games that allowed players to import their own images and place themselves inside the game (referred to as ‘InterActor’ on the game box).\n",
