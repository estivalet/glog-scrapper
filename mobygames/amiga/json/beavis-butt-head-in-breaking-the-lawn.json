  "description": "<i>Breaking the Lawn</i> is a clone of the 1983 Llamasoft game <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hover-bovver\">Hover Bovver</a></i>, and also a fan-made tribute to the notorious 1990s animated TV series <i>Beavis &amp; Butt-Head</i>. The game can be played with 1 or 2 players, and uses joystick controls. Each screen shows a large garden from high above, with grass, flowers and water features. You control either Beavis or Butt-Head, and you have a lawn mower. Your goal is to mow everything on the screen, before you can move on to the next garden. You must avoid falling in the water, and there is also an angry dog and an angrier gardener that you will need to avoid.",
