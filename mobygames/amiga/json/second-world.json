  "description": "<i>The Second World</i> is a turn-based strategy game set in a science-fiction scenario. The play world is divided into 25 countries and four opponents (optionally all of them can be controlled by humans) want to become the leading force. \nThis is either achieved by gaining control over 15 countries (either by buying them or with force), driving all competition out of the business or getting a certain amount of victory points with economic or belligerent achievements.<br><br>Gameplay focuses on economical management and can be seen as expanded <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kaiser\">Kaiser</a>. During each round (which represents three months), the player can adjust the setting screws of the countries, e.g by hiring agents (can be sent on special missions like assassinating an opponent), stock dealing, trading produced goods, setting the tax or starting a war. Especially important is constructing buildings like hospitals or plants. All those factors determine the statistics of the country, e.g. productivity , prosperity or the death rate. A killed ruler will be replaced by offspring if available. Gameplay is menu based with the exception of smaller action sequences.",
