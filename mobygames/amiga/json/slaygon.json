  "description": "In <i>Slaygon</i> the player takes control of an advanced robot and has to infiltrate the facility of Cybordynamics, a corporation that is developing a toxic virus that potentially can kill all humans. The task ahead is to locate the main computer and disable it so that the cooling system of the facility's reactor will fail. To do so five override codes have to be found and entered into the computer. As the cooling system fails the facility will ultimately explode but before that the player has to steal a top secret data disk and flee from the building.<br><br>The game is played from a first person perspective similar to a dungeon crawler and is completely controlled though a mouse based interface. While exploring the facility various objects have to be collected such as key cards to get through locked doors. There are also traps such as force fields, ionizer beams and proton mines that require the right items to get past without harm. The player also have to watch out for the robots that guard the facility.<br><br>The player also have access to devices that can be turned on but they will cost energy which is the robot's health and when all out of energy the game is over. These are a cloaking device that makes the robot invisible, battle sensors that show enemies' laser and shield strength, a shield generator that protects from damage, a laser amplifier that attacks robot guards, a long range scanner that plots out a large area on the map and a plotter that maps areas as the player moves around.",
