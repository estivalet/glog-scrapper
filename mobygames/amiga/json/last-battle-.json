  "description": "<i>Last Battle</i> is a side-scrolling beat-em-up game in which the player takes control of a martial artist named Aarzak who must single-handedly (and -footedly) defeat the lackeys of an evil fighter called Duke, and eventually stand against three generals who have kidnapped his girlfriend. The hero fights using punches and kicks, combining these moves with jumping and crouching. He also has a special power meter that refills over the time. When the power meter is full, Aarzak gains a boost that allows him to perform rapid attacks for the rest of the stage. <br><br>Most of the levels are simple scrolling areas that the player needs to complete within a time limit. Some levels, however, are more maze-like, requiring the player to explore them in order to find the exit. Bosses await Aarzak at the end of most stages. He will also encounter allies who will increase his offensive or defensive strength, or replenish his health. <br><br>The original Japanese version is based on the <i>Fist of the North Star</i> manga and anime; the protagonist is Kenshiro, the main hero of the series. All character names have been changed in the translated version, which also has reduced gore. However, the rest of the visuals, gameplay, and locations remain identical.",
