  "description": "Loosely based around the Gibson Games board-game, you are in control of a team of 4 POWs – a Brit, a Frenchman, an American and a Pole) and must guide them all to what many attempted and few achieved – escape from the notorious Nazi POW camp. You control each of the 4 men separately, each of them starting within their own quarters on different floors of the camp, and can always switch between them. <br><br>The gameplay has a similar feel to isometric-view Spectrum games, notably <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Great+Escape%e2%80%99\">The Great Escape</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Head+Over+Heels%e2%80%99\">Head Over Heels</a>. Collecting and using objects is a significant part of your task – lock-picks for the low-security doors, keys for the more secure ones, German uniforms to allow you to move around freely, and shovels to dig for freedom. You must avoid entering forbidden areas – do this and you will be placed in solitary confinement and have your equipment confiscated – if you attempt to run from the guards in such areas they will shoot at you.\n",
