Then along comes a horde of aliens who promptly steal the lot. You're tough, you're mad and you're gonna make 'em pay so  you jump into your fighter, arm and fuel both it and the probe ship and set off.<br><br>In the single player game the player controls the fighter, this is better armed but can only move left/right along the bottom of the screen and it fires straight ahead. In the two player game the second player controls the probe ship, this has less firepower but can move around the screen and can aim its shots.<br><br>Players have five lives with which to complete the eight levels.\n",
