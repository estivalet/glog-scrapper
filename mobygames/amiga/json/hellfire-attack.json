  "description": "Your SuperCobra assault helicopter is the most advanced of its kind, oozing with missiles and full of power, ready to blow everything in its path into the weeds. All it needs now is a capable pilot; hopefully you can fit the bill.<br><br>The action is spread over day and night levels, across different types of terrain. On each level you must destroy a set number of aircraft to move onto the next level - otherwise the level loops back to the start. Extra lives can be collected throughout, and your plane is armed with smart bombs to use when the action is especially hectic.",
