  "description": "<i>All Over the World</i> is a German-language promotional game for Pepsi consisting of a collection of five mini-games controlled with the joystick, each based in a different continent.<br><br><b>Öl-Fieber</b> <i>(Alaska)</i>: There are four metal pipes slowly dripping oil onto the ground. You must run between them and collect as much spilled oil as possible in the time limit.<br><br><b>Lachsfang</b> <i>(Ireland)</i>: You are standing in a shallow stream holding a net as fish are jumping upstream over a small dip. Your goal is to catch as many fish as possible in the time limit.<br><br><b>Nil-Überquerung</b> <i>(Egypt)</i>: A <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/frogger\">Frogger</a></i> clone across the Nile, where you must hop from one side of the river to the other using small boats, pieces of wood and the backs of crocodiles that are moving rapidly in both directions. You have a time limit to complete this task, but you only need to do it successfully once and start again immediately if you fail.<br><br><b>Teehaus-Crash</b> <i>(Japan)</i>: There are four conveyor belts producing teacups. It is your job to run between them and catch the teacups as they fall off the end of the conveyor belt, so they don't fall to the floor and smash. You need to save as many as possible within the time limit.<br><br><b>Känguruh-Rennen</b> <i>(Australia)</i>: You are a kangaroo hopping across the plain, trying to avoid hazards both high and low. You can press the fire button to do a extra-large jump over an obstacle (such as other animals), and hold down on the joystick to keep low, for example to avoid spiky overhanging tree branches.",
