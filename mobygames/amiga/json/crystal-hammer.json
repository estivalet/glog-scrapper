  "description": "One of the Amiga's many <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a> clones, Crystal Hammer is perhaps best remembered by its intro tune, which has been remixed and covered by many.<br><br>The game is all about reflecting a ball against a wall of bricks. Behind the wall of bricks live some worm-like creatures that will come out to disturb you when you've opened a hole in the wall. Prolonged contact with the creatures will kill your bat. Destroying bricks will often cause a coloured brick to come spinning down slowly. These spinning bricks are power-ups, altering your ball or bat according to their colour. You can have a sticky bat (green), a wide bat (blue), a slower ball (yellow), multiple balls (cyan), and the decidedly Arkanoid-inspired shooting bat (red). Whatever you do, don't pick up the grey brick, or you will be destroyed.",
