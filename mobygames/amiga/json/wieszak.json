  "description": "<i>Wieszak</i> is a simplified word-guessing game based on the original paper and pencil game Hangman. The game shows a word with a series of blank spaces. The player has a certain number of guesses. Every mistake means drawing a part of the picture of a hanged man. Once the picture is completed the game is over. Guessing the word allows proceeding to the next round.<br><br>The game features 200 words.",
