While the basic concept is the same – Pacman eating dots in a maze populated by four ghosts, the special items are not just bonus fruit, but also upgrades and weapons.<br><br>Amongst the upgrades are a speedup, a shield, a gun to shoot the ghosts, dynamite to make them explode, glue to slow them down and a freezer to make them stop in their tracks. Other upgrades transport you to a random level or one of the bonus levels.<br><br>Similar to <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Deluxe+Galaga\">Deluxe Galaga</a></i>, collecting all five of the letters E, X, T, R, A grants an extra life, and there are point multipliers of different values.<br><br>An updated version, now called <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/deluxe-pocmon\">Deluxe PocMon</a></i> to avoid legal troubles, has been released for Mac and PC.",
