  "description": "<em>Hockey Pista</em> simulates the sport of roller hockey. Matches are played on a single screen over a duration set by the player (for single matches). The human player always controls the skater closest to the ball <em>and</em> the goalkeeper at the same time, though the goalkeeper only moves sideways. The game offers single matches against the CPU or in 2-player mode, as well as a championship. The player's team name and colors are customizable.<br><br>An updated re-release of the game was sponsored by Italian professional player Franco Girardelli, then in Roller Monza. This version features minor graphical improvements, faster gameplay and a few other tweaks such as splitting matches into halves. The difficulty level is not selectable in this version. It is otherwise the same game as the non-sponsored version.",
