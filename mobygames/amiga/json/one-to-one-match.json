  "description": "<i>One to One Match</i> is a concentration/memory game designed to be played by children. Like in other games of its kind cards have to be flipped two at a time and if they have the same symbol they are removed. If the symbols does not match they are put back and the player has to keep flipping cards in search for matches. This version features digitized speech that reads out the names of the symbols and it's possible to choose from several different card packs with different kinds of symbols. The number of cards to be played can also be chosen: 20, 30 or 40. There are five different game modes: a solo mode, a local multiplayer mode for two players and three different difficulty levels against an AI opponent.",
