  "description": "This is a C language port of Crowther's original <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=ADVENTURE\">ADVENTURE</a>.</i> In order to restore the original version (which was then thought to be lost) <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,633217/\">Marvin W. Rasmussen</a> started out with the BSD-C port of <i>Adventure</i> from the CP/M public domain library, made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,482618/\">Jay R. Jaeger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,633218/\">L. C. Calhoun</a> and compared it to two older versions written in Fortran: an ISIS-II Fortran-77 version (itself merged from a Fortran-10 version made by Crowther and Woods and a Fortran-IV-Plus version called <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/adventures\">ADVENTURES</a></i> made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,633219/\">Kent Blackett</a> at DEC) and a version written for an unknown mini computer (probably a Harris). Using the Fortran versions, the original wording (with spelling mistakes and all) and interpreter mechanisms were reintroduced into the new C version written for the Atari ST.<br><br>This was for many years regarded as as close to the original Crowther/Woods <i>ADVENTURE</i> one could get, until an original Fortran version of Crowther's ur-Adventure was discovered on a backup tape in 2007.",
