  "description": "Lead the men in green pants through the Sherwood Forrest and fight the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Robin Hood is a teambased realtime-strategy game from the developers of Desperados. You can control up to six different characters with different trades in a mixture of realtime-action, strategy and sneaking... You have to kill enemies, make them drunk (Friar Tuck's special ability) and investigate the area... All six characters have different special abilities and weapons. If you don't want to kill people, make them unconscious and tie them up with Stutely, for example... Robin Hood is much like other team-based rts - as Desperados or Commandos - just with the trashy-touch of the old Robin Hood movies... :) So, a lot of tactical and strategical knowledge is needed to free the land from the evil Sheriff of Nottingham...",
