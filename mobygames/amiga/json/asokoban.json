  "description": "<i>ASokoban</i> is an Amiga implementation of classic puzzle game <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/soko-ban\">Sokoban</a></i> originally by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Thinking+Rabbit\">Thinking Rabbit</a>. As a warehouse keeper, your job is to push crates (or sacks of money using the default tile set) to their proper places. However, if you push a crate into a corner, you can't pull it back, and you can't push several crates at once. This requires careful planning ahead and often doing things in a very roundabout way. Thankfully, there is an undo function.<br><br>One main feature of <i>ASokoban</i> is that it is totally system-friendly, running in a window on any Workbench screen. Another feature is its open architecture, enabling it to load new level sets (the default one being a quite drab 4 colours), translations and tilesets, an ARexx port for scripting, and that the game window can be resized freely.",
