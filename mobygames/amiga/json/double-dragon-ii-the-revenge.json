  "description": "The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Double+Dragon\">the first Double Dragon game</a>, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.<br><br>The original arcade version of &quot;Double Dragon II&quot; was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, &quot;Double Dragon II&quot; discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/renegade\">Renegade</a>.<br><br>The <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=475000008149\">NES version</a> offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.",
