  "description": "Snakeman is a public domain <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Oil%27s+Well\">Oil's Well</a> style game. The idea is to extend a snake down into a maze to collect 'dots'. The body of the snake extends into the maze, and this can't be crossed over, however you may retract the snake in order to take a different route through the maze or to avoid enemies. Should an enemy make contact with your snake, you lose a life. A level is cleared by collecting all the dots in it. Bonus items are scattered around the levels, which reward the player with extra time, points or lives if collected.<br><br>Snakeman was programmed in the AMOS programming language.",
