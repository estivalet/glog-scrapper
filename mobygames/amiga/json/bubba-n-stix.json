Bubba and Stix become friends and start on their journey home, They're now on an alien planet where things are a little bit different than they are on Earth. Take control of Bubba as he wields Stix as various puzzle solving tool (including a weapon), as they try to find a way back home. You'll have to solve mind-boggling puzzles and fight all kinds of wacky aliens. If you're planning to return to Earth, you'll have to have fast reflexes and be able to think fast and sometimes sideways.<br><br>The game consists of five levels that vary in terms of graphics, music and type of puzzles that need to be solved. On his way Bubba will find little blobs and other aliens that after each level are summed up and according to how many of them have been collected, the player is awarded additional seconds in the bonus level.",
