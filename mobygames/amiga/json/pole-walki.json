  "description": "<i>Pole Walki</i> is a tactical turn based strategy for up to four players (humans or computer), played on a side scrolling map. The aim of the game is to eliminate all the opponents. The player can choose the number of computer opponents and one of several available maps. Each player has a base of command and similar amount of funds. In each turn the player may purchase the equipment and issue orders to all units. Each combat unit is described by a picture, name, armor, fire power, shot range, capacity and current damage status. In the course of issuing an attack command there is shown a scanner land, the option to select the slope of the barrel and the strength of the attack. The player can also benefit from air support, repair or dig the unit. The player can choose between ten types of weapons and six types of mech units. The initial amount of money can be multiplied by destroying enemy units and finding natural resources by entrenched mechs.",
