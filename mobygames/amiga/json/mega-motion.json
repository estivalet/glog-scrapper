  "description": "<i>Mega Motion</i> is a puzzle game where the player has to move a number of balls across the screen towards an exit. The balls are linked together with one acting as an anchor the others are constantly rotating around. The game is played with the mouse. By clicking on one of the balls it becomes the anchor that the others rotate around. Clicking with the right mouse button changes the direction of the rotation.<br><br>Each level has obstacles that block the balls' path and objects that can be collected. Most common are blocks that are destroyed after being hit by a ball a couple of times but there are also those obstacles that destroy the ball that hits them. There are also bombs, which set off chain reactions when hit, and switcher blocks that reveal hidden doors or open up new passages. When all balls but one have been destroyed a life is lost and the level has to be restarted. Each level also has a time limit. Overstepping it is allowed but the player will then get a lower score. <br><br>The game has a total of 100 levels that are divided into four categories: easy, average, difficult and very difficult. For every level completed the player is given a password.",
