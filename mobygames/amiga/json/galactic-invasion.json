  "description": "<i>Galactic Invasion</i> is part of MicroIllusions' One To One series. Like the other two game in the series (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/fire-power\">Fire Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/turbo__\">Turbo</a>) it's primarily a multiplayer game that is played in split screen, either with two player locally or over a modem connection. It does however also feature a single player mode against an AI opponent.<br><br>The game is a pseudo-3D space shooter played from a first person perspective. The world consists of two solar systems, one for each player, that are separated by a field of meteors. The objective for each player is to assemble a warhead by collecting five parts and then use it to destroy the opponent's entire solar system. In total there are fifteen parts and they come in three different colours. The players have to collect five of these and they all have to be of the same colour. Once a player has collected the first part he has to continue with the same colour and the opponent has to collect one of the other two colours. Warhead parts are found inside satellites that orbit around planets that the player first has to shoot down. After a while the player will run out of fuel and to get more the player has to fire at meteors.",
