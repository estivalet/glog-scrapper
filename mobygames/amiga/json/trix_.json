  "description": "<i>Trix</i> is a clone of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/qix\">Qix</a></i>. As in the original, it is your task, represented by a little dot, to fill in the screen by drawing lines across it, while avoiding the bunch of moving lines (called the Trix), an angry face (the Sparkle) and sparks (the Foo) that move across the frame and the lines you draw. The game is multitasking-friendly.",
