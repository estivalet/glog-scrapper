  "description": "<i>Hack</i> is the precursor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nethack\">NetHack</a>, both members of the family of text-based <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Rogue\">Rogue</a>-like games. Like other roguelikes, <i>Hack</i> is the quintessential computer role-playing game (RPG):  Choose a character class and venture forth into the dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure.<br><br>Like all descendants of <i>Rogue</i>, <i>Hack</i> is displayed from a top-down view, painted with text characters.  The player ventures throughout the dungeon, visiting rooms connected by thin corridors.  Gameplay is turn-based, with the turn beginning with the player's action (move, attack, eat, cast spell, etc.).  Commands are mapped to various letters of the keyboard, including &quot;i&quot; for inventory, &quot;e&quot; for eat food, etc. with one exception:  Attacking a monster involves running into it, so the &quot;attack&quot; function shares the same keys as movement.<br><br><i>Hack</i> is one of the first significant deviations from <i>Rogue</i>, notable by the rich interaction possible in the game world:  Simple actions result in complex (yet logical) reactions.  For example, it is not uncommon to throw a boomerang only to miss the target and have it return to hit the player; or kill a monster that has the ability to turn you to stone as an attack, then accidentally step on its carcass on the way out and turn to stone; or having a bolt of fire from a magic wand ricochet around the room, hit the player, and cause his magic scrolls to catch on fire; etc.  In addition, monsters and objects have secondary, hidden properties; for example, killing and eating a leprechaun will result in the player randomly teleporting to different locations.",
