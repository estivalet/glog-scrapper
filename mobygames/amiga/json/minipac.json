  "description": "A <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pacman</a></i> clone that runs in a small window on the Amiga Workbench. Through its use of hardware sprites, it can achieve coloured ghosts and players even on a 4-colour screen. If focus is changed to another window, the game is automatically paused. Control is via joystick or keyboard, and starting level is user-selectable.",
