  "description": "<i>MAX Rally</i> is a racing game played from a top down perspective similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Micro+Machines\">Micro Machines</a>. The game consists of a single player championship mode, two multi player modes and a time trial mode. <br><br>In the championship mode the player competes against three AI drivers and the aim in each race is to simply finish first after twelve laps. If not successful with that, the player will lose a continue and have try again. The championship is won when all tracks have been won. If all five continues are lost the player will have to re-attempt the whole championship from the start. In total there are five levels, each with five tracks and it's up to the player to decide in which order they should be played. In addition to the regular levels, there are also special challenge tracks where the screen moves independently of the car and the player has to keep up. The objective here is to complete three laps without falling of the edge of the track or disappearing off the sides of the screen. <br><br>The multi player is for up to four players and can be played locally or through a null modem connection. There are two multiplayer modes: battle and race. In the battle mode the players have to race ahead of the opposition so that they disappear off the screen. The last player to remain in the game will win a point. The winner is the player that first reaches five points. The race mode is simply about crossing the finish line first. <br><br>The time trial can be played by one player against previously set records or by four players competing against each other. One player races at a time and the aim is simply to get the best time. ",
