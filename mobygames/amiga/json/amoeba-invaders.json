  "description": "<i>Amoeba Invaders</i> is a single player, keyboard or joystick controlled, <i>Space Invaders</i> clone.<br><br>Gameplay is pretty much the same as all other games of this type, the player has a cannon which can move left and right. It hides behind four houses that are gradually reduced to rubble before being completely destroyed by a screen full of descending alien ships. Every so-often a mother ship flies across of the screen. During the game an extra base is awarded when the score exceeds 1500 points, but there is only one extra base per game.<br><br>One feature this game has which many games do not is that the player can choose map their own keys to the Left/Right/Fire and Pause actions. When a game is over the high score for the gaming session is updated but it is not saved for later and the player is not prompted for their name/initials.",
