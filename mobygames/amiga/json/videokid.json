  "description": "Imagine being teleported into five diverse movie worlds - Medieval, Wild West, Science-Fiction, Gangster and Horror, and having to fight your way out. That's the situation which befalls couch-potato Billy when a new video recorder malfunctions.<br><br>Gameplay has some similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mega+Twins%27\">Mega Twins</a>, with multi-directional scrolling through each level. Billy must face (amongst other things) knights and gargoyles in Medieval world, cowboys and then Indians in the Wild West, spaceships and aliens in Sci-Fi world, biplanes and squad cars in 1930s Chicago, and ghosts and skeletons in horror world.<br><br>Fortunately many upgrades to your initial missiles are available, with the laser being the best of all. These weapons can be upgraded to fire in more directions, with smart bombs and shields also available.",
