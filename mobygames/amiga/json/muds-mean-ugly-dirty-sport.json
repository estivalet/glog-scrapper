  "description": "M.U.D.S. (Mean Ugly Dirty Sports) is a slightly humorous but definitely violent game in which the game itself is won by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don't get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.<br><br>Of course, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.<br><br>Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.<br><br>M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the similarities end.",
