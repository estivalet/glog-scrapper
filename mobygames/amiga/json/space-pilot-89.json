  "description": "<i>Space Pilot '89</i> is a remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/space-pilot_\">Space Pilot</a> and a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/time-pilot\">Time Pilot</a>. The background story involves a pilot who gets mixed up in a time trap and visits different time zones. There he has to shoot a certain amount of enemies to get access to the next level which increases the difficulty. Enemies either try to ram the player or shoot rockets.<br><br>New in comparison to the original <i>Space Pilot</i> is the power up system: shot enemies may leave symbols behind which grant advantages when picked up, e.g. a shield, automatic fire (both for a limited amount of time) or another weapon. The symbol changes if it is shot. The game scrolls in multiple directions and all few levels there is a boss to defeat.",
