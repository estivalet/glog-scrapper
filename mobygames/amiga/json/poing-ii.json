  "description": "The second edition of the quirky horizontal <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a></i> clone <i>Poing</i> has (especially as of version 2.1) undergone great improvements, representing much of what would define the remaining installments in the 7-part series. There are now more upgrade blocks, including some which mainly serve visual purposes, such as dancing polygons in the bottom of the screen. Other additions are sampled drums (while the rest of the music is still real-time synthesised), new algorithmic drum patterns and the intricate star bricks which both increase bonus points, turns on the dancing polygons and make your ball harder so that it can break the &quot;bricky bricks&quot;.",
