  "description": "A clone of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Robotron%3a+2084\">Robotron</a>, Llamatron uses the same principle but ups the action level, graphics and sound. For those who haven't played Robotron, the aim is simply to control you character (in this case a llama), shoot all the various monsters and rescue all the innocents (sheep). <br><br>Your weapon is always on automatic fire and you shoot in the direction you are facing but if you hold the fire button it locks the gun in that direction allowing you to move around.  Various power-ups are presented to you during the game and two-player support is also in there.",
