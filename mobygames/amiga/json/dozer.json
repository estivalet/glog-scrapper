  "description": "<i>Dozer</i> is a variation on the &quot;indirectly guiding creatures to safety&quot; kind of puzzle game, typified by <i><a href=\"www.mobygames.com/game/lemmings\">Lemmings</a></i>. Here there is only one creature you need to guide: a small red dinosaur, that walks endlessly in circles around the perimeter of the blocks that it is adjacent to. You control a small bulldozer that is able to push blocks around the level, altering the dinosaur's path and eventually leading it back to its cage. Not all blocks can be pushed however, and even when a block is pushable, it might not be pushable from all sides. The sides of a block that can be pushed are indicated by a green triangle, pointing inwards.",
