  "description": "It is August 1991, the USSR has only a few days left before its tremendous collapse and KGB officer Maksim Rukov has been moved, without explanation, to the newly formed Department P which investigates KGB corruption and roots out possible double-agents and traitors.<br><br>The game's interface and engine is based heavily on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Cryo\">Cryo's</a> previous game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dune\">Dune</a>, using the same point-and-click system, and a pseudo first-person perspective. The game also allowed players to rewind to the beginning of chapters to correct mistakes they had made.<br><br>KGB was later re-released in an &quot;enhanced&quot; CD-ROM version featuring new video sections of actor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,139112/\">Donald Sutherland</a> as Rukov's father, giving hints and clues whenever needed. The game was also re-titled <i>Conspiracy</i> for this re-release.",
