  "description": "Once again, Earth is in peril. A robot race, the Myrons, put an energy layer over the planet with the goal to cause a climatic disaster. The player mans the Sunburst, a modern space ship, to fetch technicians with the means to disable the layer. Unfortunately he has to cross ten hostile planets...<br><br><i>Warp</i> is a shooter which scrolls in all directions. The goal is to destroy the anti-warp generator of each world, but first their protection shields have to be disabled. This is done by destroying all power plants. Of course there is also a lot of resistance by enemies which try to deplete the Sunburst's protection shields (reaching zero results in a life loss). Those can be dealt with by shooting them with one of the two laser beams with different power and energy consumption. <br><br>Weapons and shields are powered by different energy pools, but the player can redistribute the energy among them. Energy can be replenished and a map of the level can be displayed by flying near certain buildings.",
