  "description": "<i>Advanced Laser Chess</i> is a two player strategy game. It's a more complex version of Laser Chess by the same author and adds more pieces. A 15 x 11 board with a randomly appearing displacement device at its center is the playfield. Pieces on top of the device disappear and reappear when the device is no longer visible. All pieces have unique capabilities with the diamond shaped piece being the king, whose capture brings the end of the game, as does him being hit by a laser.\n",
