  "description": "<i>BrainMan</i> is a top-down puzzle game. The player takes control over a blob who has two tasks in each level: collecting enough stars and finally finding the exit. However, there are obstacles, including blocks (which can, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Soko-Ban\">Soko-Ban</a>, only pushed but not pulled), closed doors, a time limit or other blobs which should not be touched. Keys, which act like the blocks mentioned before, can be used to open the closed doors. If is possible to get a level into an unwinnable state, e.g. by pushing a key into a corner.",
