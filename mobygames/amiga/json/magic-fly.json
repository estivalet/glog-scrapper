  "description": "Your enemy have designed a new fighter craft, the Moth. The only prototype is held in a network of caves within an asteroid, heavily protected by 30 different types of craft. As a pilot of the T2 'Magic Fly' craft, it is your job to find and destroy the Moth.<br><br>You fly through a set of tunnels presented in a mixture of vectors and solid 3D, with arrows guiding you as to which way to go. The ship's damage is split into ten areas, and the auto-repair feature can be set to prioritise these. Energy resources are limited, and must be allocated across different areas of the ship.<br><br>Accurate steering and shooting are not enough – puzzles protect the route, and these will take some pondering. You are armed with multiple weapons (types of lasers, mines, a rear-gunning-droid and various guiding missiles), each of which has its own use. You also have an on-board map and radar, as well as a turbo facility. ",
