  "description": "<i>Power Struggle</i> allows you to compete against a friend or the computer for World domination as either the West or the East. After choosing your side you are presented with a map of the World. The countries belonging to the West are in green, the countries belonging to the East are red and neutral countries are white. Your aim is to take over as many countries as you can while your opponent is doing the same.<br><br>You are presented with icons and within a time limit must decide how to take over countries, these options are attack, supply, apply political influence or build factories and armies. Once you have both made your choices the orders are executed. Although you can take over countries your opponent can take yours over and vice versa so holding on to them is part of the challenge as well. ",
