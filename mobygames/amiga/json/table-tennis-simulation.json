  "description": "&quot;Realistic life on a table tennis table&quot; is the poorly-translated promise for this recreation of a popular indoor game. You can play a full season of tournaments, with world rankings updated as you go. Singles and doubles matches are on offer, and their lengths are variable. A full ball-machine training mode is offered, which allows you to face a succession of shots, with a choice of shot styles and speeds to allow you to hone problem areas of your game. Two player matches can also be played, and mouse or joystick control are supported.",
