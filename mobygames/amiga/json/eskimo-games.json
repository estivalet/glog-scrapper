  "description": "<i>Eskimo Games</i> takes the winter sports multi-event format and emphasises the winter rather than the sports. <i>Operation Snowball</i> is similar to the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Cabal\">Cabal</a> insofar as it resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a> but adds a roll manoeuvre. You must fire snowballs at people who are trying to make a catapult, and destroy the shots they aim at you.<br><br><i>Eggsterminator</i> places you at the top of a cliff, which has 5 ledges containing a bird’s nest. Birds will periodically land on these and lay eggs, which you must collect. Contact with the birds themselves causes you to fall and lose time. <i>Ice N’Igloos</i> involves using your axe to collect ice, and taking it to your incomplete igloo to complete it. Avoid the seals, as contact with these costs you time.<br><br><i>Miami Ice</i> is a clone of <a id=\"d5160ed97c42db285f1ef9cc0aa5eca2d\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tapper\">Tapper</a>, except that instead of beer you are serving ice cream to people. From one side of the screen you must ensure that each line has enough ice creams sent down it to match the number of people coming. Also ensure that you are ready to collect the empty cones when these are returned. Evidently, the taste of wafers is not popular near the poles.<br><br>The final event is not present on the C64. It is <i>Barbearian</i>, a one-on-one fight with a polar bear. The ice melting away sets the time limit in this game.",
