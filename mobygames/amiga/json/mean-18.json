  "description": "<i>Mean 18</i> is a golf simulation released in the early years of 16-bit technology. The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.<br><br>Apart from the Bush Hill course the game comes with <i>Famous Course Disk Volume I</i> which includes:\n<ul>\n<li>St Andrews, Scotland, UK</li>\n<li>Pebble Beach, California, USA</li>\n<li>Augusta National, Georgia, USA</li>\n</ul>\nA unique feature for the day was the Course Architect, which was quite versatile with practice.<br><br>Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Beginner/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring. ",
