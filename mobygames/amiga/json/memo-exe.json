  "description": "<i>Memo Exe</i> was designed to develop memorization abilities. The player watches for a while series of drawings arranged in a sequence, and then he sees the same images in a completely different order. The player's task is to restore their original arrangement before the time runs out. An initial series of images are radically different from each other, but then the differences between them becoming smaller, making the task much harder. The game features five difficulty levels, introducing from 5 to 20 of the drawings. ",
