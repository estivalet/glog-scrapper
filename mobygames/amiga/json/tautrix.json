  "description": "<i>Tautrix</i> is in many aspects a typical falling block puzzles in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a>, except that the blocks don't fall. Those blocks with different shapes and colour appear in the middle of the screen and the player can freely move them over the rest of the field. They stick wherever they come into contact, be it a wall or another block. The goal is to create squares of the same colour which then disappear and reward points for the high score list. There is a time limit in place which runs out when the current block is not moved - it is also the indicator for when the game is over.",
