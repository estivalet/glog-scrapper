  "description": "<i>Shuffle Pix</i> is a sliding puzzle game without variations to the known playing principle. The playfield is a 5x5 grid and on each tile except one is a part of a scrambled picture. The player's job is to slide the tiles in the correct order within a time limit by using the empty tile as buffer. There are three playing modes: one with complete pictures like a clock, one with abstract colour combinations and a training mode. The desired end result is shown besides the playing grid and there are small animations to see after beating a level.",
