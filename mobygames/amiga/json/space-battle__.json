  "description": "<i>Space Battle</i> is a one or two player version of the classic arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/asteroids_\">Asteroids</a> where you have to survive being in a asteroid field where the rocks move about the screen. With a joystick you need to move about the screen or shoot them which makes them split into two. You keep splitting them till they are finally destroyed. If things get too hectic you can Hyperspace to another part of the screen but you can easily appear in the path of an asteroid. The game is viewed from above and the whole asteroid field is shown on the whole screen. There are three modes of the game, Solo (One player game), Team (One and Two players scores are combined) and Competition (One and Two players compete for the highest score).",
