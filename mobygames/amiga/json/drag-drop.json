  "description": "<i>Drag &amp; Drop</i> is a puzzle game where you place pre-arranged sets of blocks onto a grid. By creating horizontal or vertical lines of blocks which cross from one side of the grid to the other, you gain points and the block lines are removed to make space for more sets. Seven different game modes, including three timed modes, provide different challenges, and a &quot;virus&quot; option exists which randomly removes placed blocks, increasing the game's challenge. The game was developed using AMOS, with source code available with the game.",
