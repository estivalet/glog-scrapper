  "description": "<i>Dirty Rackets</i> is a game of the shareware scene, which is a remodelled (and expanded) version of the classic Atari Pong. Now you can play tennis (singles and doubles), soccer and &quot;frontón&quot;. The game modes available are the usual for this kind of game (single match and championship), although this time there's also the option of a points league. Game settings are varied too, you can make your racket bigger or faster, choose to play for the points or against time, or 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 players. For the nostalgics, there's also an option to play the classic black-and-white Pong.",
