  "description": "The year is 1993. The rock star Axel Pose is on the peak of his success and in celebration of his new album, a radio station organizes a lottery. Answer five question about this album and win a meeting with Axel Pose. This game is based on the real-life band Guns 'n' Roses and their front man <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,273650/\">Axl Rose</a>. As a big fan, you are of course trying to buy the album immediately - but it is not as easy as it seems...<br><br>As a promotional game, <i>Backstage</i> is neither long nor complicated. With a standard point-and-click interface you solve puzzles and speak to people.
