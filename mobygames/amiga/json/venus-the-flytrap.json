  "description": "After humanity destroys the earth through over-population and excess pollution, it becomes essential to send a robotic fly through to clean it up. You take control of the fly, shooting out the mutated creatures and plants. You must get through 8 worlds, including Frozen Wastes, Caverns and Death Valley.<br><br>Most sentient creatures release a ball when killed; shoot this to release one of many features such as enhanced weaponry, faster movement, an extra life, or negative ones like losing a life or having your controls reversed. As the game progresses the levels become more intricate and platform-based.",
