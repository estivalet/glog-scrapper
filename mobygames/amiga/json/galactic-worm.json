  "description": "A &quot;snake&quot; game written in compiled AmigaBASIC with a few unusual touches. When the worm eats the subterranean strawberries, it grows, and a rock appears on the screen. But colliding with a rock (rocks are optional) doesn't kill the worm, it only cuts it a segment shorter. Colliding with walls is also non-lethal, only stopping the worm in its tracks. However, colliding itself will kill the worm.",
