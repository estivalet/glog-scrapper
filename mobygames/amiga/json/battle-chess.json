  "description": "<i>Battle Chess</i> is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. <br><br>The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. <br><br>Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.",
