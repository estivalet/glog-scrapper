  "description": "<i>Brainball</i> is a game that was bundled with an edition of the magazine Amiga Fun / Amiga Mania. There are three balls made of iron, wood and glass. The player needs to push them into holes with a very limited number of hits in a limited amount of time. To do so you need to use springs which have three levels of power. Each ball behaves differently and depending on the power can move from 1 up to 5 fields. There are numerous objects in the levels that complicate things: surfaces that make the balls go faster or slower, walls the balls will bounce off of, ravines you need to avoid.",
