  "description": "<i>The World of Magic</i> is a fantasy point &amp; click adventure game about a young mage named Grendon, in a magical land called Kawamoon. As the game begins we learn that Grendon's home village was attacked by goblins, and the survivors were forced to flee. Now alone and with nowhere to call home, Grendon decides he needs to complete his training in magic. He wanders into a small town in the dead of night, and heads to the local tavern, hoping to find a wizard.<br><br>The interface splits the screen into two parts: the top half shows the current scene from a third-person perspective, and underneath is a panel that displays the inventory items you are carrying, as well as eight action buttons (&quot;Look at&quot;, &quot;Talk to&quot;, &quot;Give&quot;, &quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;Use ... with ...&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Close&quot; and &quot;Operate&quot;). Left-clicking the mouse selects an action button or an inventory item on the bottom panel, or if you left-click in the scene it causes the main character to walk towards the clicked location. Right-clicking is used to perform an action on a scene object or character. There are 10 savegame slots that can be saved to by holding down the shift key and pressing one of the function keys F1-F10, and then later loaded from by pressing the same function key without holding down shift.",
