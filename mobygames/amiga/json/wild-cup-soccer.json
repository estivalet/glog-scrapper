  "description": "Following on from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/brutal-sports-football\">Brutal Sports Football</a> came this interpretation of soccer, released alongside the 1994 World Cup. In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single ‘Unfriendly’ matches.<br><br>Unlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=FIFA+International+Soccer\">the original FIFA</a> was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a ‘Penalty Shoot Out’, which involves going round shooting the opposition;– the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.",
