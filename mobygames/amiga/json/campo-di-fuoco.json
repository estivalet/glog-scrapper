  "description": "<em>Campo di Fuoco</em> simulates an indoor shooting range. The main game mode is a tournament divided into thee events with three rounds each. The events are: precision, where you have to shoot the target as close to the center as possible; speed, where the target is toggled at regular intervals; and draw, where you have a single opportunity to hit five targets in sequence. Up to six human players can take part in a tournament.<br><br>The main challenge in the game is provided by the extremely shaky sights, which need to constantly be counterbalanced with mouse movement.",
