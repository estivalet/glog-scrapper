  "description": "<i>Wild Life</i> is basically the same game as the developer's previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/safari-guns\">Safari Guns</a> with new scenarios (America, Arctic, India and Australia) and interface. In each level, the player is given a list of three animals he needs to photograph. The process is similar to first-person shooters like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a>: the player controls a crosshair over the left and right scrolling landscape. After an animal appears, the crosshair needs to be quickly moved over them and a click triggers the photograph. <br><br>The interface is basically a set of buttons which need to be clicked on to change the active crosshair: hand (needed to pick up additional equipment or medi packs for healing), 50 mm lens, telephoto lens (for small and far off animals) and a rifle (shooting hunters which try to hurt the player). The number of photographs the player can take is limited and needs to be refilled by picking up frequently appearing new rolls.",
