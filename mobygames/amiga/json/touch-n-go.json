  "description": "There's a witty double meaning in this title. You must guide a character from the start of a maze through to the end. The difficulty is that each square disappears after you step on it, meaning that you have to touch the square and go, without being able to return.<br><br>You're also up against a strict time limit, so it's all too easy to make a crucial mistake and be forced to step into oblivion. It's therefore definitely touch and go as to whether you can get through it.\n",
