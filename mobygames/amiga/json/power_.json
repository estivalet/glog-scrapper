  "description": "<i>The Power</i> is a puzzle game with similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atomix\">Atomix</a>: The player takes the role of the blob Max who has to collect all hearts divided over the level and then go to his girlfriend Mimi; all within a time limit. However, when Max starts walking into one direction, he only stops when he touches a block. The player also has access to certain blocks of three colours which can be moved with the same rules as Max, but when blocks with a certain colour combination crash against each other (e.g. a moving red onto a green) they vaporize. The game features two playing modes, arcade and tactic, with the basic difference that the arcade mode scrolls and the tactics mode fits each level in one screen.<br><br>Only the Amiga version has the split-screen multiplayer mode in which two players try to solve a level first. The level editor is not present in the C64 cassette version.",
