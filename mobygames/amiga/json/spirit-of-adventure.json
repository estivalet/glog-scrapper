  "description": "In a medieval fantasy world, strange drugs appear that create an addiction among the population. It appears that they are all coming from one central point that is controlled by a mysterious stranger. The player controls a group of heroes in this role-playing game as he tries to find out the origins of the drug and to break down on the man who is responsible for them.<br><br><i>Spirit of Adventure</i> allows the player to create his/her own party, choosing between various character classes, including traditional fighters and priests, but also less common classes such as Goddess or Banshee. Characters have three main parameters; body, mind, and magic, as well as strength, dexterity, IQ, and charisma. Controlling a party of up to six combatants, the player has to accept quests, explore towns, and battle enemies to advance the story.",
