  "description": "Bunny's girlfriend has been kidnapped by an ape, and 30 screens of blocks have been placed between them. Love can't climb all barriers, but a bunny skilled in baseball can smash through them, using his bat to hit each brick on each screen in turn. This sets the scene for a variant on <moby game=\"Breakout\">Breakout.<br><br>The screens contain rows of bricks, some of them indestructible, and lots of doors to open for access to other sections, and dividing lines affecting where the ball can go. Power-ups are released at regular intervals. You need to press fire as the ball approaches to strike it and keep it in play.",
