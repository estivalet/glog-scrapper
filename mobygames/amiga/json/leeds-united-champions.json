  "description": "<i>Leeds United Champions!</i> is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control of Leeds United, the English champions of the 1991/92 season, in the fourth division; the goal being to conquer the Premier League in the long run. The game is completely menu based and the sub-menus are reached through a list of icons in the main menu. In those menus the player can set all the usual options of the genre, e.g. training, transfer market, lineup, ticket prices, youth section or stadium expansion. There is no match presentation to speak of; just a screen representing a live ticker which gives out the goals and bookings. Each athlete has 15 stats which influence his performance on the field.",
