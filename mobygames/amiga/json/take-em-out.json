  "description": "Take 'em Out is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/operation-wolf\">Operation Wolf</a> clone. As in that game, the player has to shoot waves after waves of enemies that keep appearing on the screen, while avoiding civilian targets. Shooting certain items like grenades and first-aid kits recharge ammunition and the energy bar respectively.<br><br>The game is mouse-controlled, and after scoring a minimum amount of points in the shooting gallery that precedes every level, the player can carry two different weapons from a choice of four: machine-gun, shotgun, grenades and a bazooka. They can be assigned to the mouse buttons on the weapon selection screen that appears at the beginning of every level. On the top-right of the screen there's a energy bar that decreases as the enemy shoots.<br><br>The game doesn´t have a number of &quot;lives&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, passwords or any form of saving progress: if the energy bar reaches zero or the player can't amass the necessary score, the game starts all over again.",
