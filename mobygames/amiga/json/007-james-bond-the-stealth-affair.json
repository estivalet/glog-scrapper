  "description": "<i>The Stealth Affair</i> is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface. The player controls the famous secret agent James Bond (John Glames in the European version), whose task is to travel to South America in order to locate and retrieve a newly designed F-19 stealth plane, which was stolen from the Naval Air Station in Miramar, California. <br><br>The game is controlled by the same pop-up command menu consisting of six verbs that was introduced in Delphine's debut <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/future-wars-adventures-in-time\">Future Wars: Adventures in Time</a>. However, it's been slightly improved and does now allow interaction with the inventory, like examining and combining items. The player can use many typical special agent's gadgets, beginning with a passport forgery kit and ending with explosive cigarettes. Apart from solving puzzles, the player has to make it through some arcade sequences: escape the labyrinth, dive with limited breath, and dodge the evil guy's minions. ",
