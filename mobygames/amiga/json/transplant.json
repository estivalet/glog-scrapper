  "description": "The basic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a> gameplay features of rocks which break into smaller rocks when shot, and the game’s playfield rotating around the player, are implemented in this shoot ‘em up. Besides the rocks, there are lots of spaceships, many of which shoot at the player, and some which are clearly ‘inspired’ by the designs in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Star+Wars+universe\">Star Wars</a>. All of these must be cleared to complete the level.<br><br>The player starts the game with 3 very basic ships, having no firepower, flexibility or shield upgrades. On each level, money can be collected, which can be spent on these items. Every item can be upgraded through five levels, although these are increasingly expensive. There is no points system however.<br><br>Rather innovatively, the game hands out passwords after each game so the player can continue at the start of the level on which the last life was lost. This means that if more than one life was lost on the same level, all of them will be back, and also any purchased power-up is taken back and the money returned (allowing the player to make new decisions).",
