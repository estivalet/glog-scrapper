  "description": "<i>Lost Dutchman Mine</i> is a simulation game that casts the player in the role of a gold miner in the 1860's. The player can freely explore a town and a vast desert, limited only by the protagonist's necessity to eat and rest. One of the game's goals is to earn money, which can be achieved by searching gold in a river, mining for gold, or capturing wanted criminals. It is possible to buy food or catch fish with a fishing gear equipped. Hostile explorers and dangerous animals impede the protagonist's process. Location layout and characters are randomly generated each time the player begins the game.",
