  "description": "<i>Assassins PD Games vol 1</i> is the first in a series of compilations of public domain games 'developed' by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=The+Assassins\">The Assassins</a>, a couple of guys from the north of England. In all they produced at least two hundred and fifty such compilations which typically contained between two and six games many of which had been featured on cover discs for the UK versions of magazines such as Amiga Power and Amiga Format. The games in this compilation were:<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/tanx\">Tanx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/rollerpede\">Rollerpede</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/amigoids\">Amigoids</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/cave-runner\">Cave Runner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/avatris\">Avatris</a></li></ul>\nThese compilations were sold by mail order through a number of suppliers of public domain software who would usually assign their own catalogue number, so it is not uncommon to find the same compilation on offer from multiple suppliers in the same magazine.\n",
