  "description": "<i>Girl Actions</i> is a single person, keyboard controlled, space shooter. Its name is a play on words as it sounds like <i>Galaxians</i> the game it closely resembles. The title screen, however, gives nothing away as it consists of just the name, a bouncing picture of a pretty girl, and a long scrolling message from the author.<br><br>There are multiple levels to the game, the author's notes which scroll across the bottom of the title screen, eventually say that the game does not get any harder after level sixteen. Gameplay, in the early levels at least, is similar to Galaxian in that formations of alien ships move from side to side at the top of the screen dropping bombs, occasionally groups will break formation and swoop towards the player's ship which they will attempt to destroy by swamping the area with bombs or by crashing into it.\n",
