  "description": "<i>Blitzkrieg: Battle At The Ardennes</i> is a conversion of the 1965 board game Blitzkrieg from Avalon Hill. In stead of the fictional country the original board game plays in this game features the Battle of the Bulge in the second World War. The game is a turn-based strategical wargame that plays on a map with hexagonal tiles. Each tile can represent different types of terrain, such as urban and forest, which has impacts on your units. Like the board game it features both land, naval and aerial units; this includes artillery and even V-2 Rockets. The game can be played against the computer or against another player.",
