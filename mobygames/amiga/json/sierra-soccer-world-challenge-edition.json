  "description": "<i>Sierra Soccer: World Challenge Edition</i> is a soccer game in which the player participates in the (unlicensed) World Cup '94; either with the original or random groups. Each athlete has six attributes, e.g. reaction speed, which influence his performance during the match. During the match, which is shown from a slightly angled top-down view, the player directly controls the team and can additionally change tactics and line-up. The controlled athlete is automatically chosen by the computer.<br><br>Additionally to the World Cup, there are also friendly matches in addition to a training mode. Besides a standard one-against-one match, up to eight players can control one team in tournament mode. Those are either national teams with slightly changed athlete names or new teams with custom athletes.",
