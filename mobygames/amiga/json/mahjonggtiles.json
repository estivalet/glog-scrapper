  "description": "MahjonggTiles is a system-friendly version of the old ”mahjongg solitaire” (or ”<a id=\"d467a974a17f973f1845fc30177de2bfc\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Shanghai\">Shanghai</a>”, running in a window on any public screen.<br><br>The typical features of any Shanghai variant are available:<ul>\n<li>Undo move/suggest move\n<li>Different tilesets\n<li>Different tile arrangements\n<li>Timed games</ul><br><br>The MahjonggTiles puts a lot of emphasis on the visual side of things. The direction of shadows can be defined, as can the window backdrop. Not only is a range of tilesets available, but more can be drawn by the user. A range of different tile arrangements, apart from the usual ”Dragon&quot;, can be loaded and even created using a bundled editor. For really lazy players, the game can be set to always show all available matching tiles. Rather uniquely, there is a store of removed bricks for browsing, similar to the history in your web browser. If you find that a tile you need has been removed earlier, you find it in the tile history in chronological removal order and can recall all moves back to that tile.",
