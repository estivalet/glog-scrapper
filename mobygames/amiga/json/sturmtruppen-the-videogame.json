  "description": "<em>Sturmtruppen</em> is a run 'n' gun platform/shooter based on the eponymous Italian comic book series by Bonvi, which follows the misadventures of a German World War II battalion made of cowardly, childish and incompetent soldiers.<br><br>The player controls an infiltrated soldier who must fight his way through the German garrison across six horizontally-scrolling platforming levels. Initially, the player can only use punches or kicks, but a limited amount of bullets and grenades can be obtained upon defeating higher officers. Throughout each level the player comes across vehicles, such as motorbikes, jeeps and small airplanes, upon boarding which the level becomes playable in a horizontal shooter mode similar to <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/moon-patrol\">Moon Patrol</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/silkworm\">Silkworm</a></em>. The player has only one life measured by an energy bar which, depending on the game mode, applies either to the soldier or to his vehicle: if the energy bar is depleted while in a vehicle, the player must continue on foot; if it runs out while on foot, then the game is over.<br><br>Similarly to <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lupo-alberto-the-videogame\">Lupo Alberto</a></em>, also by Idea Software, the game box came with an incomplete <em>Sturmtruppen</em> comic book strip: at the end of each level, the player is shown one of the missing panels, so that the comic can only be completed by beating the game.",
