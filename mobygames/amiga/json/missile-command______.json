  "description": "<i>Missile Command</i> is a freeware remake of the classic arcade game. <br><br>As the commander of a missile base, it is your responsibility to defend cities from an attack. Missiles and other weapons descend from the top of the screen and to protect the cities your missiles must detonate in their flight path so that they get caught in the blast radius and destroyed. If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed, when all the missiles are dealt with another wave begins, when all of the cities are gone, the game is over.\n",
