  "description": "<i>Balder's Grove</i> is a &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; clone for the Amiga. The game mechanics are based primarily on the Commodore 64 version. It features 40 levels, a level editor (with support for up to 100 levels in total), and a 2-player mode. Music plays on the title screen, but during gameplay there are only sound effects.<br><br>The aesthetic theme of Balder's Grove is based on Norse mythology. You control Balder, one of the Nordic gods and son of Odin, a blonde-haired figure wearing a blue tunic. The goal in each stage is to cut through a leafy grove collecting enough rings for the exit to open up, which Balder must reach before the time limit runs out. In his way are a number of deadly green snakes and bearded, heavily-armed berserkers. You can destroy these enemies by dropping boulders on them, which in this game are large runestones, painted in red and black.<br><br>In 2-player mode, there are two exits to reach at the end of the level, and each player must use a different one.",
