  "description": "<i>Austerlitz</i>, just as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/napoleon-in-russia-borodino-1812\">the previous title from the same authors</a>, is a tile-based wargame played in real-time - a rare trait in that period. The player takes command of either French or Russo-Austrian armies in the Battle of Austerlitz, fought on 2 December 1805 (which ended as a massive defeat of Third Coalition forces).<br><br>You may play the complete battle, portion of it, or an alternative scenario. Fatigue and morale affects the infantry, cavalry and artillery on the battlefield.",
