You need to help Donald locate all 26 of the letters and put them back in place. By pressing a letter on the keyboard, an animation is displayed where Donald finds and catches that letter. There are six different screens a letter may be hiding on, and each letter features a different animation. When all of the letters have been collected, the game is over and a bonus screen is displayed.",
