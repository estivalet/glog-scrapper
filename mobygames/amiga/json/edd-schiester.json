  "description": "Edd Schiester is a short point &amp; click graphic adventure game for the Amiga, created with AMOS. The interface is a LucasArts-style control panel with verb action buttons like &quot;Pick up&quot; and &quot;Talk to&quot;, but there is also one labelled &quot;Violence!&quot; used to attack characters in the game. The game has something of a sick sense of humor, and includes a warning screen that it is not intended for children. It was released as shareware in 1992 and distributed by software libraries such as 17-Bit Software.<br><br>The plot of the game is simple: the main character, Edd Schiester, has found himself trapped underground in a strange network of catacombs. The only goal is to find a way out.<br><br>Left-clicking the mouse is used to select verb actions and objects. If the right mouse button is clicked while the main character is walking, this cancels the walk movement, but does not prevent an action from happening afterwards: for instance, if you &quot;Walk to&quot; a door, and then immediately right-click, the new location loads immediately as if the main character had &quot;warped&quot; over to the door.<br><br>There are no conversation trees, but if you talk to a character twice they will usually something different the second time. The game's engine appears to only support exits at four fixed locations on the screen.<br><br>The only sound featured in the game is two music tracks that play during the title screens.",
