  "description": "<i>Raider</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/thrust\">Thrust</a> variant. The player controls a space ship over planet surfaces with the goal to pick up a cog on each planet. After four planets are finished, the player needs to fly through a power plant to get rid of them.<br><br>However, there are gun turrets which try to shoot the ship. But the main problem is gravity which affects the ship and may cause it to bump in the ground or walls. This is of course unhealthy and needs to be avoided by using the rocket thruster to counter steer. Besides of this, the player can  rotate the ship and fire shots to destroy the turrets. During the 40 levels, the game introduces additional obstacles like variable gravity levels or tractor beams.",
