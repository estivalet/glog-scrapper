  "description": "For centuries the essence of Quaal, once a powerful and terrible demon, has been trapped inside the sword that once killed him. After a volcanic eruption, however, the blade is stolen by one of Quaal's dark servants intent upon reviving their lord. Four heroes are called upon to retrieve the blade before it's too late.<br><br><i>Blade</i> is a turn-based role playing game played from an isometric perspective. However its control scheme is more similar to turn-based tactical games of the time like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/x-com-ufo-defense\">X-COM</a>, in that each turn is strictly divided into a player phase and an enemy phase, and each character has a limited amount of action points per turn. There is no character creation but the four heroes can be picked from a range of eight, each of a particular class. There is a form of economy as the party starts with a limited sum of gold which can be deposited in a bank and used to purchase equipment. Combat is extremely simplistic, as the player only selects the monster that will be automatically attacked if within range.",
