  "description": "This is an unusual take on the football management game, which features virtually no statistics. Up to four managers can join in, to lead their chosen team through the World Cup, from qualifying to the actual tournament. Tactics and training are hugely important due to the game's short time frame.<br><br>The players each have individual personalities, and these have been factored in during the game. Sometimes players will drink too much, fall in love, or have personality clashes with their team-mates or with you, all of which have to be factored in. The press will ask you loaded questions, so be careful how you answer.<br><br>At half-time in each match you can single out a particular player for praise or criticism - if the team feels that you were unfair, their performance might fade. The World Cup is emulated accurately, other than having 2 points for a win instead of 3. The colourful match graphics and oil-painted stills are the same in style as those in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=League+Edition\">the League Edition</a>.",
