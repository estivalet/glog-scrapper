  "description": "You are a commander of HMS Raider, on a daring privateer raid into the extremities of the planet Hell. Your mission is to collect diamonds from this hellish planet. Fly around, collect diamonds and shoot all incoming enemies. <br><br>Only your HMS Raider can collect diamonds. There are four fighters inside your Raider, called Orbitals. You can use them to survey the area and destroy enemies while your mothership keeps collecting diamonds automatically or by another player. If orbital is used, camera follows it, so stay close to Raider if another player is controlling it. It is hard to collect diamonds if can't see them or yourself)",
