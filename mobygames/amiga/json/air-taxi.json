  "description": "<i>Air Taxi's</i> basic premise involves running a taxi firm in outer space. There are no drunks or kissing couples to deal with, just 3 classes of passengers, dressed in yellow, red or white. There are a number of bases on each level, and a succession of customers will appear and hail you. <br><br>When you land on that base, they tell you where to take them by giving the target base's number. Get there successfully and they financially reward you - crash and you'll lose a life and have to pay their relatives off, which can be financially crippling early in the game. Later levels add magnetic fields, hazardous terrain and adjusted gravitational systems. You can have up to five players with a joystick adapter, which is chaotic as collisions cause both players to crash.",
