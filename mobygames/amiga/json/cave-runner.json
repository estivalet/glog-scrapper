  "description": "<i>Cave Runner</i> is a single player <i>Boulder Dash</i> type of game<br><br>The player characters digs through dirt and has to collect all stars before the exit opens up. Naturally there are obstacles and enemies which make this seemingly simple task more challenging. Rocks abound and are subject to gravity so they fall down when the player removes the dirt under them. This can not only be used to open the path, or close it if the player makes a wrong move,  but also to kill enemies by crushing them. <br><br>The game has sound, a high score table and twenty-six levels each of which has to be solved within a time limit.",
