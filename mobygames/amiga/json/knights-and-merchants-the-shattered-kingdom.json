  "description": "<i>Knights &amp; Merchants</i> is a game very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/settlers-ii-veni-vidi-vici\">Settlers II</a>, and that's not really a coincidence, as they were made by the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,3223/\">lead programmer</a>, who started his own company (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Joymania+Entertainment\">Joymania</a>). <br><br>In <i>K&amp;M</i> you start building a base and gain resources, and after that you make an army and try to attack the enemy. It's a mix between a godsim and a RTS game. <br><br>The game features resolutions up to 1024x768 with high-detail landscapes in 3D, with 2D-bitmap buildings placed upon it.",
