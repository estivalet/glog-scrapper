  "description": "Using the game engine from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jimmy-whites-whirlwind-snooker\">Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker</a>, this game recreates pool in minute detail. A bold 3D graphics engine with realistic physics and millions of shot permutations (in terms of direction, speed and spin) is at the heart of it. Three versions of pool are offered - UK and US 8-ball as well as the fast-paced all-action 9-ball game.<br><br>There are 20 computer opponents, with the hardest of them being almost unbeatable, as well as two-player and trick-shot modes. Unlike the original release of <i>Whirlwind Snooker</i>, you can save more than one game on the disk at a time.",
