  "description": "The <i>Amiga Software Extra Nr. 12</i> is a Markt &amp; Technik compilation of three low-budget games developed in Germany that were never released elsewhere. The following games are included:<br><br>\n1) Highway 42<br><br>The player assumes the role of a young car courier, trying to make a life by doing freight jobs. So, the basic gameplay of <i>Highway 42</i> is driving from city to city in search for new assignments, where the driving part is designed as a simple racing game and the city visits as text menus, and completing these jobs for money. The earned money should be spent on fuel and car repair firstly, an surplus can be used to upgrade the car. From time to time the player can accept a quest that's mostly of the bounty-hunt or fetch-that-item kind. Furthermore, there's cities in the game world where young promising pilots can participate in price races. As these races can be dangerous and the streets out there are so, the car can be equipped with weaponry, too.<br><br>\n2) Warlords<br><br>Although wearing a more or less famous name, <i>Warlords</i> is a simple two-player board game that's not to be confused with the successful fantasy strategy franchise. The game can be played by one human player versus the computer with four difficulty levels available. Two human players can engage via hot seat option.<br><br>Gameplay itself is a stripped-down checkers variant with twelve stones each that takes place on an 8x8 board. Target of the game is to bring one stone to the other player's base line. <i>Warlords</i> also features a board editor.\n  <br><br>3) Zargon<br><br>The player controls a green fighter jet from top-down that is free to fly over the whole vertically scrolling screen, but can shoot only in the scrolling direction. Besides avoiding or shooting the enemy sprites, three power-ups can be collected, namely extra lives, extra points and better ammo. When the player's jet hits an enemy or is being hit by enemy bullets, it will instantly fall back to the weakest ammunition.<br><br>The game offers only three military/naval themed background sets and one single (long) set of enemy waves, both of which are constantly repeating. The enemies are a wild mingle-mangle of objects that do not fit into a certain theme. There are hamburgers, skulls, fighter planes, satellites, coke cans and many more to fight. Furthermore, <i>Zargon</i> differs from other shooters in that there are no boss fights, and gameplay has no end except the player dying. Target of the game, instead, is to collect as many points as possible for an entry in the high score list.<br><br>As many Amiga action games of that time, <i>Zargon</i> also offers two player gameplay, here the second player controls an additional green fighter jet on the same screen.",
