  "description": "<i>Behind the Iron Gate</i> is a 1st-person perspective <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Doom\">DOOM</a>-style game, set in a prison. The game requires the player to accomplish various small mission objectives. These objectives comprise little more than putting a key into a lock to unlock gates, which is done several times before you must activate a self-destruct sequence and escape within the required time, similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/alien-breed-tower-assault\">\tAlien Breed: Tower Assault</a>.<br><br>As with all such games you have some enemies to foil and extra weaponry such as rockets, stun bolters and  to pick up. Game mechanics are <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Wolfenstein+3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a>-influenced, and the graphics smooth and, surprisingly, fast, though they do not vary much except in colour tint. Sound effects consist of the odd gun shot and scream and the music is designed to be atmospherically suited. Four different control systems are offered.",
