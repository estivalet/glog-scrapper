  "description": "Mortal Kumquat III (a.k.a. Fruit Fighter II Turbo G.T.I. XL 4x4) is a fighting game parody for the Amiga. It requires two players with joysticks. Each player controls one of two fighters: a green character named &quot;Mo-Shi-P&quot;, and an orange character named &quot;Ho-Ran-G&quot;. Both have their own special finishing move when they win a fight. The first player to win two rounds wins the overall game.<br><br>Pressing the joystick fire button on its own has no effect, you also need to move the joystick in a direction at the same time: towards the other player to punch, away from the other player to block, diagonally up-left or up-right to do a spinning jump, and so on.<br><br>Before you play, the game goes through several decision screens (including choosing the title of the game itself) that ultimately have no effect on gameplay at all.<br><br>Mortal Kumquat III was created exclusively for Amiga Action magazine, to be included as a coverdisk game on the July 1995 issue.",
