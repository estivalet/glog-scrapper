  "description": "Based on the Disney movie of the same name, <i>The Black Cauldron</i> focuses on the story of Taran, who is an assistant Pig-keeper in the land of Caer Dalben. One day Taran notices that one of his pigs, Hen Wen has magical powers. The Evil Horned King wants the pig so that he can locate the Black Cauldron and ultimately rule the world. Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before he can discover the Cauldron's location.<br><br><i>The Black Cauldron</i> is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Quest+II\">Space Quest II</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kings-quest-iii-to-heir-is-human\">King's Quest III</a>) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.",
