  "description": "<i>Future Tank</i> is a one or two player shoot 'em up which lets you control a tank from a bird's eye view. You are able to drive through big scrolling maps in all four directions. You have to fight your way through enemy lines in order to find the level's exit similar to popular Gauntlet style mazes. The game has 32 levels and was one of the first games using 32 colours (5 bitmaps) simultaneously outmatching all the Atari ST games that were limited to 16 colours. Furthermore the games used the Hi-Res graphics mode of the Amiga for the first loading screen. This had not been used in a commercial game on Amiga before.",
