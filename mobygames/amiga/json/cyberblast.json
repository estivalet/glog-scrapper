  "description": "<i>Cyberblast</i> puts the player in Fastrax Laboratories where the Trans-universal Portal Experiment in the solar system has gone completely haywire. The player must make it through all 64 levels until he finds the missing control chip. The control chip needs to be found in order to close the portal as it's being open allows for deadly aliens to enter our universe.<br><br>The game is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>, and levels must be completed within a time limit which changes based on level complexity. In order to complete levels, the player has to locate and collect the five crystals and then find and use the exit. Walls, enemies, and other obstacles will impede the player throughout the game and players much maintain a supply of energy units or their game will come to an end. Players can select between two characters at the start of each level. The two characters have different qualities and limitations which make them more or less adept to each different level.<br><br>",
