  "description": "<i>Knight Orc</i> is a text adventure with graphics. The protagonist, Gringleguts the Orc, swears revenge on all humankind for the treatment of his race. The game flows in real time; each person and creature goes on about their daily lives and follows their schedule. So, if the protagonist revisits an area and finds a person that was previously there gone, it may mean that the person in question is in another location. The player's decisions and timing play a key role to the game's outcome.",
