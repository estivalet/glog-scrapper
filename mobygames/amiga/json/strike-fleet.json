But instead of simulating hydrofoils you can now command a complete fleet of war ships into several missions. These missions are related to political events that were of interest when the first version of the game was released in 1987. <br><br>As captain of the fleet you can switch between different ships of your fleet and even command helicopters to support your mission.",
