  "description": "<i>Great Nations</i> is a shareware clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization\">Civilization</a> that was designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to eight players can compete against each other in hot seat mode as well as in network games. The game comes with a built-in chat client, several maps and a random map generator. In addition, players can create custom maps as BMP images and convert them into the game's map format, without the need for a special map editing program.<br><br>Because <i>Great Nations</i> was developed as a multiplayer game, there is no single-player mode in which the player can compete against AI opponents.",
