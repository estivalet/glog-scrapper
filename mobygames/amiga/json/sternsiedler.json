  "description": "<i>Stern Siedler</i> is a basic, menu-based strategy game. The player has to conquer 50 solar systems (each one representing a level) with up to eight planets each. So the player needs to build enough fighting robots in order to overrun the other planets. But that is not that easy; the colony needs resources, technology and people. The player's job is to play with the setting screws of the menu screens, e.g. birthrate and money distribution, to reach an economical order. The progression of the colony is measured in various numbers like evolution rate or intelligence. Because the other planets don't stand still, it is useful to think of defenses. And when another planet is conquered, it requires the same amount of management as the first - all while the clock is ticking in real-time.",
