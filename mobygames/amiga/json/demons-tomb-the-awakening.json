Unbeknown to him, the evil god Darsuggotha is trying to ascend from his dimension and incarnate on a heathen priest called Tzen. Richard must stop him, as the demon is bent on destroying the world.</i><br><br><b>Demon's Tomb: The Awakening</b> is a text adventure set on England on modern times. The game starts with a prologue to the rest of the game, where the player controls the main character's father while he is fighting for his life. After this brief prelude, the story jumps to 16 years-old Richard and his search for his father in Britain's moors.<br><br>The parser is on par with the one developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Infocom\">Infocom</a>. It supports chain commands and adverb recognition, and goes beyond by adding support of mouse input and interface customization. These features are enabled on a menu that pops up when right-clicking on the screen.<br><br>The optional verb menu allows complete sentence construction with the mouse. The interface can be changed to several different ways of displaying text, from a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zork-the-great-underground-empire\">Zorkish</a> traditional full screen output to a scrolling window.<br><br>Some locations have a picture associated with them that can be displayed by pressing a key.<br><br>There is support for setting up macros within the game (for example, a &quot;IN&quot; abbreviation for &quot;Inventory&quot; can be set by entering DEFINE IN=INVENTORY).<br><br>The game has an online hint-system. The player gets clues by using the THINK ABOUT command with something in the game.<br><br>The game supports disk saving and loading, as well as memory saving and loading (with the commands RAM SAVE and RAM LOAD, respectively).",
