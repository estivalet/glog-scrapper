  "description": "This platform romp has similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ghosts+%27N+Goblins\">Ghosts 'N Goblins</a>, sending you on a journey to defeat the forces of evil. You start the game with nine lives, and you'll need them although there are only 3 (large) levels, each finishing with a boss. All manner of monsters block your path and must be attacked with your horizontally-travelling daggers. Additional weapons can be collected, as can bonus orbs, and the chance to summon a spirit to attack for you on the toughest sections.",
