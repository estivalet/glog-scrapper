  "description": "<i>The Playroom</i> is an educational game which is set in the locale of a child's bedroom. Almost everything on the screen can be clicked on, and the child will be rewarded by games, activities, or at least an amusing animation. In this first of what eventually became a trilogy of games including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/treehouse\">The Treehouse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/backyard\">The Backyard</a>, children are encouraged to use the mouse by the wide range of interactivity with items on the screen. Games and activities encourage creativity, the learning of numbers, and letters, and the development of critical thinking.",
