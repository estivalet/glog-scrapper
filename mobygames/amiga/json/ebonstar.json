  "description": "<i>Ebonstar</i> is the title of a futuristic tournament sport. The non-scrolling playfield basically consists of the player's space ship and a moving black hole which sucks everything in. The goal is to destabilize it by shooting a big space ship, called the ark. Just spraying shots will not cut it, though, an exact horizontal shot at its gripper arm is necessary.<br><br>This is further complicated by various enemies on the screen. The player's ship does not die from attacks but is tossed back which may result in being sucked into the black hole. There are helpful extras like a shield or rockets, though. The game can be played by up to four players and the winner is whoever shoots the ark first. The competition can be thinned by shoving the competitors into the black hole.",
