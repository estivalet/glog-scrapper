  "description": "<i>Karuzelada</i> is a video game based on the TV show <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>. The players take turns guessing letters to form a word or a saying. The game can be played with up to three human players. During their turn the players can spin the wheel, guess a consonant, buy a vowel or guess a password. The game faithfully reflects the principle of the TV show, introducing three stages: three preliminary rounds (each player spins the wheel  at the start of his turn), semi final (only one spin of the wheel at the stage beginning and 10 seconds turns), final (player lists 10 consonants and 1 vowel and has 30 seconds to guess the password).",
