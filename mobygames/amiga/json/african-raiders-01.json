  "description": "The game tries to represent the African part of 11th Paris-Dakar rally route, which in the game takes place in Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal in 1988-1989.<br><br>Controlling his(her) car in third-person 'behind the car' view, player should drive through the marked path in Sahara. When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.<br><br>Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:<br>\n1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); <br>\n2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); <br>\n3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); <br>\n4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); <br>\n5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).<br><br>So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.",
