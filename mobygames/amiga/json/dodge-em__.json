The player controls a race car on a track made up of several lanes which are lined with dots. The goal is to collect all of the dots to earn points and advance to the next level. The race track is broken up into four quadrants; race cars are unable to change lanes except in small gaps between these quadrants. Trying to stop the player are enemy cars which travel in the opposite direction. Crashing into an enemy car costs the player a life. Care therefore needs to be taken to switch to lanes that the enemy car isn't occupying.",
