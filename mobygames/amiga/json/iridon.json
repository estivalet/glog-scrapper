  "description": "<i>Iridon</i> is a traditional, vertically scrolling shooter. The player's mission is simple: destroying 50 huge space ships by flying over them and destroying all buildings on them. However, there are a few obstacles: flying against a building or a space mine results in instant death. Also deadly are the missiles of the enemy defender ships, but touching the ships itself is allowed. After finishing the exterior of a mother ship, the player enters its interior which basically play out the same, just destroying vehicles instead of buildings.",
