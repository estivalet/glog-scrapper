You only have so much time to place a face part in a slot so fast reactions are needed, and you're faced with the choices of attempting to make a full face math, a partial face match or just frantically finding a free space for the face part. The more complete your face is, the more points you score. <br><br>You can also import your own photos into the game! How about trying to match faces of your friends and family?",
