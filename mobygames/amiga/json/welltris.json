  "description": "<i>Welltris</i>, which is the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> sequel, is originally designed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,533681/\">Alexey Pajitnov</a> (the \ncreator of <i>Tetris</i>) with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,23746/\">Andrei Sgenov</a>. <br><br>It has the same gameplay concept as <i>Tetris</i>; simply all the player has to do is to rotate and \nmaneuver the falling pieces into a proper position in order to form complete layers \nin the rectangular playground. But <i>Welltris</i> changes this rectangular arena into a four\nsided well with grid-like walls and bottom where the falling pieces can be moved from \nwall to wall within the well. Form the pieces into solid rows either horizontally or vertically\non the bottom of the well. <br><br>Billed itself as <i>Tetris</i> in three dimensions.\n",
