  "description": "Player Manager 2 sets you as an international-standard soccer player who's stepped into being a player-manager at a lower-division side. The challenge is to reach the Premier League and survive.<br><br>Most of the standard features of management games are present, including pre-match tactics (which are fairly customizable), a full transfer market including short-term loan deals, detailed player statistics (presented visually), ground improvements and coaching.<br><br>Playing the matches is optional, as you can simply watch instead. There are 4 playing views, and you can play in position or as a team. Initially your player is by far the best in the team, so choose his position and use him wisely. Once you reach retirement age you can only play the matches for 3 out of every 4 seasons (which is poorly explained by an 'assistant manager' concept, but is more likely an attempt to make the game harder. This would make little sense though, because scoring is very, very hard in player-manager mode).<br><br>Before each match you get a video report from renowned pundit Alan Hansen, as well as some form notes which are said to be Hansen's.",
