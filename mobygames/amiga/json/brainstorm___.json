  "description": "<i>Brainstorm</i> is a straight conversion of the game <i>Concentration</i> (also known as <i>Memory</i>). There is a set of 54 cards flipped on their back so every card looks the same. On the flip-side, there are 26 pairs with different motives. The players (in turn) flip over two cards each while trying to find a pair. When a pair is found, it is removed from the table. The goal is to find more pairs than the opponent.<br><br>This version features six card decks and the option to play alone (with the goal to have the least turns as possible), against the AI (nine difficulty levels) or against another person.",
