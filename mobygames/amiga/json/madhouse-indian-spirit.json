  "description": "Madhouse is a graphic adventure for the Amiga created with AMOS. Unusually for an adventure of this type, the player uses joystick controls instead of the mouse, and only left/right movement is used. You interact with things you are standing next to (or in front of) with the fire button. There is no inventory management or conversation trees, and instead of a save-game system, each chapter has its own password.<br><br>The hero of Madhouse is Greg Kapschnitz, janitor of the Valverdance mental institution. He discovers that there is a plan to tear down the building to make way for a highway, and is determined to help save the facility.",
