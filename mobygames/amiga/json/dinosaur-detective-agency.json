  "description": "&quot;Dinosaur Detective Agency&quot; is a platform arcade game that takes the player back 75 000 000 years. The dinosaurs that occupied our planet were far more intelligent than we know it - they had their own civilization pretty similar to ours. One of them, Sherlock Ness, runs the detective agency and helps other dinosaurs to find what was stolen from them. There are four cases to be solved and each of them takes place in a different scenery. The aim is to find the exit from the level by controlling our reptilian detective. On the way there are enemies that can be eliminated by jumping on them or can be immobilized for 5 seconds by using the flash of the camera what gives the player the possibility to pass them. After each stage the player has to take a photo of the perpetrator of the robbery (or other crime). In order to do so there is a limited number of shots the player can take.",
