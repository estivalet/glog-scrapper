  "description": "<em>The Shining Way of Kung Fu</em> is a versus fighting game. Every match is a single, non time-limited round which ends once either fighter's energy bar is depleted. A standard set of punches, kicks and sweeps is available to all the fighters. There is a choice between four fighters, though that does not affect the set of moves. Single matches can be played in 2-player versus mode.",
