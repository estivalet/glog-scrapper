This all takes place inside a human's body with a respective background image.</li><br>\n<li><i>Fullspeed</i> is a simple racing game against the time. It takes place on a highway with six lanes which is shown in a top-down perspective. The player can control the speed and needs to dodge slower vehicles by moving left and right.</li></ul>",
