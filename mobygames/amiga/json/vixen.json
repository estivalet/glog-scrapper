  "description": "The Vixen is the last human on the planet Granath, which is now ruled by a race of dinosaurs. She has been raised by foxes, and intends to follow through on a promise she made to her elders to wipe them out and restore the planet to humanity.<br><br>Each level must be completed within a time limit, but progressing from left to right. She is armed with a whip, a useful weapon for attacking the denizens of dinosaurs on each level. Lots of bonus items can also be whipped to activate them - bonus lives and extra time for example. Tokens to turn into a fox can also be collected - enough of these takes you into a bonus level set underground.",
