  "description": "<em>3D World Soccer</em> is a football game with national teams, featuring digitized sprites on a three-dimensional pitch. Unlike Simulmondo's earlier <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/i-play-3-d-soccer\">I Play: 3-D Soccer</a></em>, the player controls any member of the team, except for the goalkeeper. The camera is loosely centered on the ball, slightly zooming in or out depending on the length of its trajectory. Control is partly direct, partly tactical: in general, the player can freely move the team member under control until the fire button is pressed, whereupon an icon above his head indicates what type action he will perform, such as a pass, shot to goal or tackle. That action is generally automatic: for example, if a tackle is selected, the team member will try to follow the opponent with the ball and attempt a slide tackle when close enough.<br><br>The game is single-player only. At half time, the viewpoint changes so that the player always faces the other team's goal. The available game modes are single match, knockout tournament and championship. The game can be saved to disk during tournaments.",
