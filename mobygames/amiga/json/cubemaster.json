  "description": "<i>CubeMaster</i> is an arcade action game in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a>. In the game, a CubeMaster is a combination of an athlete and an astronaut whose task it is to defeat wave after wave of CubeDrones. Like in Asteroids, the player moves his craft (the manned mobility unit) around a zero gravity environment where the player can use a thrust to move forward and a counter force to slow down as well as rotating left and right. The drones come in two sizes. Shooting the large ones will cause them to break into smaller ones. If the smaller drones are not destroyed quickly enough they will revert to the larger size again. The player's cannon builds up heat as it is used and when overheated it needs some time to cool down.<br><br>Drones of different colors have different abilities and if the player is not quick enough in shooting them down they will change. Among these are the yellow that when touched will make the player's controls all mixed up. Others include the blue ones that decreases the firing power, the red one that depletes the shield and the dark grey ones that when shot allow the player to pass through other drones. There is also the green drones, that doesn't change color, and that requires multiple shots to take down. In addition to the drones there are also other bad guys that try to get the player.",
