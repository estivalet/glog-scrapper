  "description": "<i>Robot Commander</i> is a real-time strategy game without a background scenario which goes beyond &quot;science-fiction with robots&quot;. It is designed to be played with two players, but fighting against the AI is also an option.<br><br>Each player commands an army of robots with the goal to defeat the other player, mainly the opponent's headquarter. The game screen is quartered: a half goes to each player and this half is also split in half by itself. The upper part shows the map around the active robot (everything beyond its line of sight is blacked out) while the under part is dedicated to the menus in which the player chooses the robots and gives them commands. Examples of possible actions are patrolling, attacking, transporting droids (smaller robots) on a big robot or the &quot;follow&quot; command which can be used for moving larger squads. Another option is to repair destroyed, hostile robots and use them for the own army. Since the player can only control one robot at a time, they automatically follow the orders in absence until there is a reason to stop. <br><br>A special feature is that players not only compile their army out of 20 pre-defined robots before the match starts, but they also have the option to use an editor to create new ones or alter the statistics of existing robots. Options for the map are pre-defined, randomly generated or built with an editor. Likewise the starting positions can be picked or randomly chosen.",
