  "description": "The rarest of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Brad+Stallion+series\">Brad Stallion</a> games, this installment in the SF sex-romp series pits our priapic hero against a machine programmed for love (or at least lust) in a quest to save supermodel Miss Galaxy from the fiendish machine and keep galactic libidos lifted... if only Brad can recover from a killer post-orgy hangover and figure out where he's supposed to go!<br><br>The typically unsophisticated Free Spirit two-word text parser is here complemented with some optional ability to mouse around the display window and click on directional arrows for navigation.  A bevy of 16-bit beauties surely await Brad's single-minded attentions... all that, plus a nostalgic look back at &quot;Wang Laboratories&quot; humour!",
