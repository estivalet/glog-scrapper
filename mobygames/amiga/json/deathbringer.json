  "description": "Karn the warrior has been the scourge of a group of evil wizards for many years, and as such they have trapped a demon inside the Deathbringer Sword. Karn has this sword, and must use it to get through 30 levels to wreak his revenge.<br><br>The game is side-scrolling and beat 'em up focused. The levels are inter-connected and have multiple exits available, with over 600 screens in total. The publishers made a big deal of the level of parallax scrolling and other graphical detail in the game.",
