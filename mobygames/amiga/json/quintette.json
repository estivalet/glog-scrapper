  "description": "<i>Quintette</i> is a computer adaptation of the board game Pente. It also features Gomoku which is the game that Pente is a variant of. Both game modes are played on a board where two players place Go stones. The aim is to get five in a row or to capture five pair of the opponent's stones. The game can be played against an AI or against another human. It's also possible to watch a game with two AI players. Game options include using tournament rules or not and it's also possible to choose if black or white player should start or if there should be a flip for it. With tournament rules turned on the first player's second move is restricted and has to be at least three intersections away from the center of the board. The game features eight different difficulty levels. An option to modify the board is also included.",
