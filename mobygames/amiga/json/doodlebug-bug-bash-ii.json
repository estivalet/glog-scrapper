  "description": "<i>Doodlebug</i> is a side-scrolling platform sequel to the programmer's earlier shooter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bug-bash\">Bug Bash</a> in a very colourful cartoony style. Your aim as the &quot;Doodlebug&quot; is to make your way through five different levels (with three sub-levels each), killing baddies by jumping on their heads until you eventually make it to the final baddie.<br><br>The most unique thing about this game is the novel theme at its centre: You can choose between five different coloured pencils to throw at your baddies (presuming you've picked some up). If the pencil's flight path is uninterrupted then they'll draw a useful item for you: Either an Umbrella (for long falls), Ball (to be able to jump onto higher platforms), a Potion (invincibility), a Clock (stops time) and an Eraser (kills everything on screen).",
