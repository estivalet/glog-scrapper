  "description": "Torvak, a man with the typical barbarian looks, comes back to his homeland after an exile of five years. But instead of a warm greeting, he receives a telepathic message that an evil necromancer took over. So of course the next course of action is to travel through five levels while killing all of the necromancer's creatures on the way, including an especially nasty one at each level's end. <br><br>The levels are generally side-scrolling, but sometimes underground passages can be reached via holes. This has no significant effect, though. The gameplay consists of using the four melee weapons which three moves each to get rid of the enemies without dying from their hits. Helpful power ups can be found when destroying parts of the scenery. Besides health refreshments and invincibility, there are also permanent upgrades for Torvak available, e.g. an extended health bar, greater speed or magical enchantments for the weapons. When an upgraded weapon is equipped, a powerful spell can be unleashed by holding the fire button.",
