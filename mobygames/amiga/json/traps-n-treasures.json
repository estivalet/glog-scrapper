  "description": "Captain Jeremy Flynn’s crew have been kidnapped in the Caribbean, and he must venture through 4 large baddy-infested levels to retrieve them. Along the way, you can collect money from handily-placed treasure chests, which can be spent in various shops to gain extra weaponry. <br><br>Additionally, the levels contain all manner of surprises, and lots of hidden features, many of which require doing a sequence of things in order to uncover potentially massive bonuses. There are lots of puzzles to solve along the way, making it more similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gods\">Gods</a> or Krisalis’ previous <a id=\"d3fe600729a9f49372d7ba65466a062b9\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Arabian+Nights\">Arabian Nights</a> than a straight platform game. Many of these involving moving and positioning crates to gain access to higher points in the levels. Jeremy can swim, and there’s a considerable amount of animation on display when he does.\n",
