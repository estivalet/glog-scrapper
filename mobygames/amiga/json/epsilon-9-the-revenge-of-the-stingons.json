  "description": "Yeno Hou returns in <i>Epsilon 9: The Revenge of the Stingons</i>, a sci-fi point &amp; click graphic adventure and the sequel to <i>Starbase 13</i>. The game opens with Yeno Hou reporting to Galactic Forces headquarters immediately after the events of the previous game. He is told they already need him to deal with another urgent situation: a vital mining operation on a distant planet (Epsilon 9) has stopped responding to communications. Yeno Hou immediately takes off in a ship, and the game begins as he arrives at the mining facility's deserted front desk.<br><br>The interface divides the screen vertically into two parts: the top half shows the current scene from a third-person perspective, and underneath is a panel that displays the inventory items you are carrying, six action buttons (&quot;Examine&quot;, &quot;Operate&quot;, &quot;Use ... with ...&quot;, &quot;Take&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot; and &quot;Shoot&quot;), as well as an additional button, &quot;Switch&quot;, that allows you to select between multiple playable characters -- but only during certain parts of the game. The left mouse button is used to select action buttons, select inventory items, and to direct the currently-controlled character to walk to the clicked position in the scene. The right mouse button is used to perform an action on a room object or character. There are 10 savegame slots that can be saved to by holding down shift and pressing a function key F1-F10, and later loaded from by pressing the same function key without holding down shift.",
