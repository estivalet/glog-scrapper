  "description": "<i>The Dion Crisis</i> is the third part of the Mercenary trilogy, following on from where <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/damocles-mercenary-ii\">Damocles</a> left off. You once again find yourself in a race against time to save the galaxy, this time from the evil PC BIL.<br><br>Again the non-linear nature of this series is taken further in the vast number of ways you can stop the tyrant. Exploration of the game's large number of planets and moons will reveal clues of the many different routes you can take to achieve this goal. Run for president, become a property tycoon - or a violent 'eco' terrorist. The 'go anywhere, do anything' motto is still in full effect in this first-person perspective hybrid game.",
