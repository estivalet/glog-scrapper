  "description": "Race across the desert in your jeep avoiding pyramids at breakneck speed. The gameplay is a simple move left and right to dodge and you cant move forwards or backwards. To hamper your driving even more is the fact that your jeep gets faster and faster the closer you get to the end of the level. There is no plot to speak of but the gameplay is simple and easy to pick up and play.The game was shareware.",
