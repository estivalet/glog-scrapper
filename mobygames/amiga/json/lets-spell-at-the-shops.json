  "description": "<i>Let's Spell at the Shops</i> is one of three games in the Let's Spell series of educational games that teaches letter recognition and spelling. They all feature the same gameplay but has different settings. The player explores the setting (which consists of multiple scenes) and clicks on various objects. After clicking on an object, the player is prompted to spell it correctly by clicking on the right letters in the alphabet. There are two levels of play: one for a lower age group (4-6) where the word is spelled out from the start and one for slightly older children (ages 6-9) who has to figure out the spelling themselves. The harder level still has a hint options though that briefly shows the correct spelling. This version's setting is a mall which consists of several different stores: groceries, toys, clothes, music etc.",
