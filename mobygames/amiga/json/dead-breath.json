  "description": "<i>Dead Breath</i> is a first-person horror adventure game for the Amiga, set in a mysterious old castle. It is controlled using a large action-button panel, where each button is a picture symbolizing the action (an eye for &quot;Look At&quot;, an open door for &quot;Open&quot;, etc.) as well as compass direction arrows for movement. The current location is shown graphically, and changes that you make (for example, taking an object) are reflected in the picture, but actions are described in text instead of fully animated. The game features music and sound effects.",
