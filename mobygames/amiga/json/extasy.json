  "description": "<i>Extasy</i> is a real-time puzzle game. The game follows the story of Lucky Ball, an anthropomorphic sphere resembling the iconic Amiga Boing Ball, who travels across multiple worlds in search for his stolen lucky charm.<br><br>The objective is to guide the ball into the bottom cylinder that matches the color currently assigned to the ball itself. To do so, the player must send the ball through a series of communicating cylinders, knowing it will exit the cylinder of the same color as the cylinder it entered. If the player manages to mark all the bottom cylinders within the time limit, so that at least four out of six are of the expected color, then a line is completed and the timer is reset. Each stage has three rounds of increasing difficulty, and each round requires three lines to be completed. The player is given a password upon completion of a stage, so that the game can be replayed from there.<br><br>A line of special cylinders right before the ones to be colored contains several items with various effects: some will add or subtract a small amount of time or allow the player to momentarily stop time; others will give the ball the ability to overwrite or erase the color of a marked cylinder; others will bounce the ball back or arbitrarily change its color.",
