  "description": "Nearly 5 years before <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-rebel-assault\">Rebel Assault</a> and other fully-rendered CD-ROM titles popularised the rail-shooter gameplay, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Tynesoft\">Tynesoft</a> used it for a game with an unusual setting. You are on board a roller coaster which has been layered with targets to shoot out. <br><br>The roller coaster follows its natural path, swinging from side to side and up and down, while you aim a turret at the targets and shoot them out. After completing its cycle, the roller coaster reverses, moving through the same area moving backwards. A co-operative two player mode exists, in which each player controls a crosshair. Make sure to hang on as the ride turns. ",
