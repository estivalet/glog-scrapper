  "description": "<i>A scientist obsessed with Picasso's cubist paintings develops a weapon that turns everything to cubes. The United Kingdom sends a secret agent to revert the affected objects and monuments back to their original state.</i><br><br><b>Devious Designs</b> is a puzzle game where geometric shapes have to be assembled. The player controls a 007-style secret agent that has the ability to walk on the walls, lift heavy objects and shoot. Using these, he must drag and drop the geometric pieces scattered on the screen (by standing next to them and holding the fire button) on translucent slots. Each level is a screen with a timer on the top. When the counter runs out, the level is reset and the player looses one life. Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bubble+Bobble\">Bubble Bobble</a>, various objects fall from the screen that can be collected for points, along with more useful power-ups like explosives, extra-time, extra-lives and a special block than fills a slot (it can be shot if it's not needed). Also, if the player takes too long to solve the level a random enemy appears, but it can be killed by the agent's gun.<br><br>The game starts with 6 lives and has a password system.",
