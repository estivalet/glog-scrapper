  "description": "Inspired by the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tankz\">Tankz</a>, this Blitz Basic game pits up to five human players in a battle tank-on-tank. The playfields are outfitted with some obstacles reminiscent to those used in a &quot;snake&quot; style game, offering protection from enemy fire. Bonuses pop up from time to time, though these bonuses may either increase or decrease your energy and firepower. As a result, apart from the usual &quot;bomb your opponent to bits&quot; method, one tactic in this game is to chase your opponent into harmful bonuses.<br><br>The game can be played in single matches or tournament style, where you may save your scores between rounds in order to resume later on.",
