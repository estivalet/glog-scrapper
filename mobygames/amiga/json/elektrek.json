  "description": "If Pipe Mania were a platform game, this is what it would be. You have to direct an electric current across each level, by getting to some precariously-placed switches, and alternating their position. There are lots of bad guys trying to stop you (for a not-readily-apparent reason; maybe they’re Green campaigners), and contact with them costs you a life.<br><br>The game’s most novel feature is one I’m pretty sure I’ve never seen before – it’s almost a gameplay interpretation of double buffering (the programming technique in which you have two copies of the screen, and draw graphics to the background one, swapping them once it’s all done, to speed up play and eliminate flicker). There are two sets of platforms, one behind the other, and a simple joystick motion switches you between the two.\n",
