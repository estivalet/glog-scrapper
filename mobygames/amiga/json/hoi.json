  "description": "Hoi is a small green dinosaur, who must venture through 5 levels to reach the area in which female dinosaurs live, in the hope of finding a perfect match. <br><br>Although the gameplay is platform-rooted, there are variations, with levels introducing jet-packs and SCUBA diving. The final level features advanced strobe effects - the packaging wisely warns epileptics to stop after level 4. <br><br>There are lots of switches on the levels, as well as moving and controllable platforms. There aren't many bad guys around, the levels are large and maze-like, and big falls kill Hoi, so a methodical approach is required.",
