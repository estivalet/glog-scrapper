  "description": "<i>Maths Dragons</i> is an educational text adventure game with fantasy themes, featuring a static image of each location. The game is a variation on the classic &quot;cave crawl/treasure hunt&quot; genre of text adventure. You are deep inside the lair of the Maths Dragons. They are relatively friendly, as dragons go, but they love to hoard valuables and don't have much respect for personal property. In this case, they have stolen all of the pieces of your train set, and left them scattered across the various rooms and chambers in their network of caves. Your job is to go out and find each piece of the train set, then return them all to the empty box in the starting location. However, while you are carrying a piece of your train set back to safety, a dragon may jump out and challenge you to solve a mathematical problem. If you get it wrong, they will take something you are carrying and run off, leaving it in some other location.<br><br>Before you begin, the game allows you to configure your own level of difficulty: you can choose which types of calculation the dragons should test you on (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and the largest number you should be expected to calculate.",
