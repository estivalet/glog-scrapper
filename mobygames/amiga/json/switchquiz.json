  "description": "Computerised quiz games are a good idea, you might think, with the potential for a huge range of questions, data disks for different subjects, and questions based on music or video clips. However, they also have the problem of working out who got a question right, which can reduce things to a contest for who can press the right key (and prevent their mates from pressing them)<br><br>Switchquiz’s novel solution was to have 4 separate controllers, each of which has 4 buttons, each representing one question answer, allowing for up to 4 players, and are plugged in via the Amiga’s parallel port. The game has 1000 questions, and each one gives points to each player who gets it right. You can alter how many points it takes tow in the match, and vary the time limit per question.\n",
