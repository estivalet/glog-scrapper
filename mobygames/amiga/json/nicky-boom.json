  "description": "The sorceress Zoldrane kidnapped and casted an evil spell upon your grandfather. She wants to force him to reveal the secrets of the forest people, of whom he is the custodian. As Nicky, you must find a way to defeat Zoldrane, and get an elixir from her chest that will cure grandfather. But Zoldrane has changed all the peaceful creatures of the forest into guards, who try to stop Nicky from ever reaching her castle.<br><br>During the travels, Nicky is able to move around the levels, jump over obstacles, and duck to avoid flying threats. Nicky must collect gems, flying bombs, dynamite, keys, and other specific objects. These are used for tasks such as building a bridge over a river throwing logs, climbing ladders, using teleporters, or to break walls to find secret areas. <br><br>Enemy creatures are taken out by throwing apple remnants at them or jumping on them. Nicky's energy is drained if he makes contact with them in any other way. As you do all this, a score is calculated, and then listed in the high score table. Passwords are offered to allow you to resume from a previously-reached level.",
