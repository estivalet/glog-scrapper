  "description": "<i>JetSet Billy</i> is a clone of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jet-set-willy\">Jet Set Willy</a></i>, a platformer where the only goal is to collect a certain number of magical items found scattered through a large number of screen-sized rooms, while avoiding many hazards that can take one of your lives. Walking, jumping or falling off the edge of the screen will take you to an adjacent room. Unlike the original game, <i>JSB</i> also adds water that Billy can swim through, and the water can include currents represented by arrows that force you to only move in one direction. The game features a highscore table and a level editor.",
