  "description": "<i>Powerglove Reloaded</i> is an Amiga remake of the 2014 C64 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/powerglove\">Powerglove</a>. Later PC versions were made available as well.<br><br>In an age where fossil fuels have been exhausted, Earth's power needs are supplied by thermal reactors under both the north and south poles. Unfortunately, an explosion has knocked out the north pole reactor, and without the power supplied from the reactor, billions are at risk of dying. You are sent in to engage the reactor's backup systems and restore the power supply. Protect yourself against the out of control maintenance robots within the reactor facility and use the control diamonds to enable the backups.",
