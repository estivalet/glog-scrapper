  "description": "<i>Tidy the House</i> is a text adventure featuring a static image of each location. It is aimed at younger players, and seems to be intended to teach children tidiness as a virtue. You are the oldest of three children, and your brother and sister have both been rearranging everything in the house while you weren't looking. They are too young to know better, so it is up to you to put everything back where it is supposed to go. Each time you put something away, the game plays a burst of music as a reward. You also get points added to your score, but points are also slowly deducted over time as well, piling on pressure to complete your task quickly instead of taking your time. Some locations are in the dark, and you will need to find a light source before you can see what's been left in there.<br><br>Before you begin, you can configure the game's difficulty/realism trade-off, by deciding how many objects you can carry at once.",
