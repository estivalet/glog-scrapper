  "description": "<i>Grasshoppers Quadrille</i> is a single player puzzle, it is played entirely with the mouse.<br><br>This puzzle was first described in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,742564/\">Henry Ernest Dudeney</a>'s book <i>536 Puzzles &amp; Curious Problems</i>.<br><br>The game takes place on a 7 x 7 board. On this board the central cell is empty and the remaining forty eight cells are filled equally with red and blue tokens. The red tokens are on the left hand side and the blue tokens are on the right with the central column being split between them.<br>Red tokens can only move down and/or to the right, blue tokens can only move left and/or upwards. The object of the game is to exchange all the tokens so that the red tokens occupy the cells formerly occupied by the blue tokens and vice versa",
