  "description": "<i>Roll On</i> is a puzzle game inspired by <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/soko-ban\">Sokoban</a></i>. As in its source of inspiration, you must push objects (rocks) into position in a maze. Rocks can only be pushed, and never pulled, leading to many dead ends if you don't plan ahead. The mazes are not copied from the original or any other popular variation on the <i>Sokoban</i> theme, and carry a quite different flavour. Any level can be chosen as a starting point. Graphics are colourful, but the game is still multitasking-friendly. Nine levels are included, but a built-in level editor lets you construct more levels.",
