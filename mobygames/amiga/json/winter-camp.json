  "description": "Winter Camp is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/summer-camp\">Summer Camp</a>.  Maximus Mouse is now a rescue ranger at Camp Nice'n'Icy, but he soon notices a bird who will knock a pebble down a mountain, setting off a avalanche that will engulf the camp, unless he can prevent it, over eight varied levels.<br><br>The levels offer various challenges.  The most common type of level is a patrol.  There are three such levels, involving ice skating, boating on a river, and skiing.  On each level you have a quota of rescues to make.  There are various obstacles on the levels, and a variety of objects to use to avoid them.  For example, a spring will allow you to jump over a stretch of water.  <br><br>At the end of each of these levels is a boss, who must be defeated using the objects you have collected.  The bosses are easier to defeat the more rescues you perform.<br><br>Other levels include a skate training level, a snowball fight with bears hiding in trees, and a memory game with a cameo appearance by Clyde Radcliffe from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Creatures+%28Apex%29+Series\">Creatures series</a>.  Most of the levels have a time limit, indicated by the bird moving towards the pebble.    <br><br>",
