  "description": "As a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/defender\">Defender</a> variant, <i>Anarchy</i> is a side-scrolling parallax shooter, in which you take on the evil Anarchists and their destructive behaviour. Your ship moves left or right on a looping level, shooting the enemies and finally the bosses. You have a single life with gradually draining energy. No less than 50 High Scores are recorded.<br><br>There are no surprises in gameplay, except the usual upgrades for your ship - X-shaped pods reveal circles, which can be collected to produce multiple fire beams, multi-directional shots, and drones with advanced cannons",
