  "description": "<i>Rocky</i> (or <i>RockyClone)</i> is a multitasking-friendly clone of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a></i> for the Amiga. The graphics are colourful (at least given the fact that it only uses 8 colours) but small, with each block only occupying 8x8 pixels. Controls are via joystick or keyboard. Many levels are included, as well as the source in assembly language.",
