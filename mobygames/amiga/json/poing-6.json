  "description": "The sixth installment in the Poing series comes with a levelset entirely about mathematics. Bounce you ball, in a horizontal Break Out-style, against bricks building up numbers, mathematical signs and formulas. <br><br>Everything from the previous Poings is there; hit the right wall ten times to open the way up to the next level, and if you miss your ball, it comes hurtling back through the previous levels. There is an overwhelming amount of special blocks altering environment and ball physics, graphical effects in every corner, and semi-randomised music.<br><br>Apart from the levelset, the game engine has been revised. A new two-player &quot;squash&quot; mode is available. If you don't have a friend to play against, the computer will analyse your skill level and create a balanced drone player for you to spar against. A new &quot;wheel of fortune&quot; block gives you the chance to earn high point values when the ball lands in a trap block. Two other new block types are the teleporter blocks, which transport your ball to another place on the screen, and a block which diverts the ball in a straight line to the left at high speed.",
