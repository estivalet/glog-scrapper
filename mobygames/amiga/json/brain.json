The game is mouse-driven and configured via standard pull-down menus and can be played by two humans, against the computer or by the computer against itself, with varying levels of intelligence. There is an option to suggest the next move, moves can be reverted, screen colours changed and games in progress may be saved and loaded. The playfield is 4x4x4 squares.",
