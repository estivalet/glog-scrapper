  "description": "<i>Gravity Force</i> is a game of dexterity. Your task is to pilot a small spaceship through a series of mazes and collect various cargo containers on your way. Your spaceship obeys the laws of gravity. You have to use a single thruster to avoid collision with walls or the ground. Various types of enemies will try to hinder your cargo salvage missions.<br><br>The single player part of the game consists of a total of 49 mazes. After each five successfully finished levels you will receive a password that allows you to choose the corresponding level as your starting point in the main menu. The ten highest scores achieved will be permanently saved on disk.<br><br>There are three other game modes available: Race, Two Pilot Race and Dogfight.\n<ul><li>In Race mode you can choose one of 10 available tracks and try to achieve the best times. You'll have to avoid obstacles similar to the ones found in the single player mission mode, and a crash means that the race is over. If you succeed in achieving a track record it will be saved permanently also.</li>\n<li>Two Pilot Race offers three different tracks. The screen is splitted into two parts. Your only task is to reach the finish line before your opponent. If you crash you'll be respawned at the starting point.</li>\n<li>Dogfight offers two tracks where you can fight against another player.</li></ul>",
