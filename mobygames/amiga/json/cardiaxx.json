  "description": "A Defender style shoot 'em up with a succession of waves to fight off. The background graphics aren't very detailed, but the game's extremely fast-paced. The controls are quite precise, making the barriers at the top and bottom of the screen qutie imposing. For no apparent reason, your score is written in huge numbers in the middle of the screen. Two versions of the game exist, one from Electronic Zoo, and a budget one from Team 17, which had a few minor changes.",
