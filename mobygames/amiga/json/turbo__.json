  "description": "<i>Turbo</i> is part of MicroIllusions' One To One series. Like the other two game in the series (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Fire+Power\">Fire Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Galactic+Invasion\">Galactic Invasion</a>) it's primarily a multiplayer game that is played in split screen, either with two players locally or over a modem connection. It does however also feature a single player mode, which here is a race against the time but not against an AI opponent.<br><br>Turbo is a violent racing game played from a top down perspective. The two players enter a death race with no rules that takes place on a stretch of highway running through a city, country side and desert. The aim is simply to reach the end before the enemy who can be slowed down with various weapons and other items. These include grenades, missiles, and oil that can be dropped in front of the enemy car. There are also spikes that offer some protections and wheels that increases the maximum speed.<br><br>In addition to the opposing driver there are also other hostile cars and motorcycles as well as pedestrians. These can be killed but the police will then come after the player. Unless the player is careful or has spikes, pulling over is necessary or the police might push the car off the street.",
