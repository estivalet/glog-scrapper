  "description": "In a run-down world, plagued by criminality and bad social conditions, a notorious gangster boss is on the run. A gang of fearless fighters with a strong sense of justice are out to put an end to his regime, though. They must fight their way through the eight levels of the squalid town and the hordes of mafia henchmen. Their path is long and bloody.<br><br>The Strangers is a side-scrolling beat'em'up, firmly planted in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Double+Dragon\">Double Dragon</a> tradition. You will recognise the rather small sprites and the fierce fist-fighting. Apart from jumps, kicks and punches, weapons such as knives, chains, hockey clubs and barrels can be used to make the procedure short with the enemy, which attacks in large gangs. Another typical trait of the genre is that the enemies try to grab your character so that another one can beat you senseless. This drains your life juices, which can be replenished by picking up soft drinks. Picking up a pair of shoes makes you jump higher, and first aid kits grant you an extra credit. <br><br>If you run out of life juices, you are left standing at the mercy of the enemy, who will happily take your life in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>-inspired, very graphic &quot;fatalities&quot;. These fatalities can be turned off for the less sadistically inclined players.<br><br>Several modes of play are available:<ul>\n<li>Action game: For one or two players, played as Double Dragon. In one-player mode, two fighters are controlled simultaneously.\n<li>Death match: For up to six simultaneous players against each other in an arena. Last man standing wins. 24 different characters are available.\n<li>Gang war: As above, but split on several gangs. Energy meters are turned off, instead you fight for points. Hitting comerades impacts negatively on your score.\n<li>Training: Learn the moves of your fighter against two holographic opponents.</ul>\nTechnically, the game uses hand-drawn sprites against mostly 3D rendered backgrounds. Since the game is delivered on CD, it also features a long 3D rendered intro with a sampled narrator.",
