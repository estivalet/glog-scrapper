  "description": "<i>Die Fugger</i> is an economy simulation combining elements of games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/kaiser\">Kaiser</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hanse\">Hanse</a>. Up to six players can compete on one machine.<br><br>You're an impoverished nobody in Germany in the year 1500. However, the death of an uncle leads you to inherit 20 barrels of beer and 500 Talers of money. Start your career heading forwards to getting an renowned and rich member of the society. There are six goods to trade, across 11 different cities. But there's a lot more to do then only trading with goods: attack your opponents or bribe them or build alliances with other players. ",
