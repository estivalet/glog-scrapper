  "description": "<i>Far West</i> is a humorous genre mix set in the USA of 1850. Up to four players enter the country with the goal to become famous. The specific winning condition is to earn a million points which can be earned in a multitude of ways, e.g. by becoming a desperado, a deputy or a prospector.<br><br>The main portion of the game is based on a USA map on which the player chooses the next destination and actions to take. Most of them result in mini games, e.g. pistol duels or a memory test for trappers, others like bathing just influence the personal status. How those actions play out also rely on the character statistics which are set at the beginning of the game, e.g. reaction time or the ability to drink alcohol. Certain actions require the correct equipment which can be bought at shops, but some things (especially food and water) may not be available everywhere in the country.",
