  "description": "After the success of Cannon Fodder, a sequel was inevitable. The basic gameplay remained the same – guide a team of soldiers through a succession of levels populated by trees, huts and lakes. <br><br>The major change is that the plot involves time travel, rather than straightforward war situations, and this means levels taking place in different scenarios including a strange ‘Alien Planet’. <br><br>The levels include a variety of vehicles such as jeeps, tanks and helicopters, which can be used to shoot or even run down enemy soldiers. Standard bullets are joined by collectible grenades and rockets – use these wisely, as nothing else can destroy huts or vehicles. Finding strategic defense positions can be vital as well.",
