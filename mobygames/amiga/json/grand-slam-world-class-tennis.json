  "description": "<i>Grand Slam: World Class Tennis</i> is a tennis simulation in which the player has the opportunity to participate in the four grand slam tournaments which consist of three matches each. <br><br>While the mouse-controls itself offer no surprises, the player needs to click at the right time to start a hit and depending on the ball and athlete position either a forehand or backhand is played. There are a variety of factors which influence the match: The court surface and weather influences the ball movement and the chosen racket influence the hitting. Additionally there is the option to complain against a referee decision and a practice mode in which the match settings can be changed.",
