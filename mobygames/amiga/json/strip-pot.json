  "description": "An erotic variant of the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Fruit+Machine\">Fruit Machine</a> game. Instead of playing for money, winners are treated to full motion video clips of &quot;five of Europe's most beautiful girls&quot; (as stated on the back of the game's box) disrobing for the camera. The player's goal is to successfully strip all five of the models without running out of credits. The more you win, the more they take off.",
