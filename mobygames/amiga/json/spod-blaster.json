  "description": "A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bomberman\">Dynablaster</a> clone written in AMOS, Spod Blaster has the usual assortment of labyrinths where you and your mates may run around and bomb each other. It is however not without its special characteristics. First of all, six players may play simultaneously, as opposed to the maximum of five of the original Dynablaster. Second of all, no four-player adaptor is needed. Instead, up to three players may use the keyboard, and if CD32 joypads are used, it is possible for two players to share one joypad, with one using the steering pad and the other using the four fire buttons for control. The third feature is that the walls start closing in in a spiraling fashion when the time limit is reached, forcing the players to move towards the centre of the playfield in order to survive. The game lacks CPU players.",
