  "description": "<i>Banzai</i> is a vertically scrolling run-and-gun game inspired by the likes of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/commando\">Commando</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ikari-warriors\">Ikari Warriors</a></i>, not to mention a whole slew of cheap action films on video. <br><br>You play as a Japanese kamikaze pilot who was shot down and sent to a prison camp. In the camp, you meet a compatriot called Tomomi Aoki, who has important information which must get to the Japanese army command. Since Aoki is wounded, it is up to you to break out from the camp and deliver the vital information, which will be worthless in three days' time.<br><br>You start out armed only with a knife, but soon find an assault rifle and hand grenades. Pressing the button and pushing up on the joystick throws a grenade while your warrior screams &quot;banzai&quot;. When your energy bar reaches zero, you lose a life. Apart from enemy soldiers of many kinds, you must watch out for deep waters, air strikes and minefields.",
