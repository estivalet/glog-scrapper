  "description": "Son Shu-Shi is a typical platformer with some shooter sections. The player controls the titular protagonist who has to find and kill six guardians that are in possession of a special object that will help the king in his health conditions. The game is fast paced and consists of six worlds. Each world is divided in to two sections: outdoor where Son Shu-Shi travels through the land on foot and indoor where he flies on the cloud in order to meet and beat the boss. During the journey many pick-ups can be collected among which there are coins that serve as a currency in occassionally discovered shops.",
