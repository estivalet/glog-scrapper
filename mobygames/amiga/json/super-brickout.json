  "description": "A simple <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a></i> game written in C, based on the first Amiga Brickout game written in ABasic. For that extra Amiga feeling, the ball is drawn to resemble the famous &quot;boing&quot; ball. There are three game modes:<ul>\n<li><b>Brickout:</b> The standard game of Breakout.\n<li><b>Brickthru:</b> The ball isn't deflected by the bricks, passing through them instead.\n<li><b>Double: </b> Two paddles (one above the other) and two balls simultaneously.\n</ul>\nControl is via mouse, there is stereo panoration for sound effects, and the game is multitasking.<br><br>The Windows version uses keyboard controls and has an extra mode called <b>Bizarro Breakout</b> where ball and bricks start moving erratically when a secret hidden brick is hit.
