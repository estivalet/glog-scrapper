  "description": "Swibble Dibble follows a standard platform puzzle format, putting you in control of an aged wizard. He must guide a ball through 85 levels, but this ball does not start in the same place as him. As well as releasing and directing the ball, you must also grab the door's key. <br><br>The levels feature lots of hazards and sections which are initially blocked off - you have to shoot Blox out of your wand to create paths to walk across, and shoot away the removable blocks to create gaps in the right places. You have a limited amount of Blox on each level. Some of the blocks will collapse when you touch them, which can be a help or a hinderance. There are plenty of bonus items to collect, although these often require extra planning to reach.",
