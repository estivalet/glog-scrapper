  "description": "<i>European Football Champ</i> was released to coincide with the 1992 European Championships. The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.<br><br>Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.<br><br>The teams included differs depending on the version of the game.<br>\nBelgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain,, and Sweden (Euro Champ '92)<br>\nCIS, England, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and Scotland (European Football Champ)\n",
