  "description": "Dirk the Daring is a heroic, if clumsy knight. When Princess Daphne was kidnapped by the dragon, Singe, and taken to his castle... Dirk set out to rescue her. Due to a lack of disk and memory space in the systems of the day, the port of the arcade game, <i>Dragon's Lair</i> was split into two parts. The <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=722301231265\">first part</a> covered the half of the game dealing with entering Singe's Castle and saving the Princess. This second part, named <i>Dragon's Lair II: Escape from Singe's Castle</i> completes the game, continuing the adventure of Dirk the Daring after slaying Singe the Dragon.<br><br>Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.",
