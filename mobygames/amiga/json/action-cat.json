  "description": "In <i>Action Cat</i>, the player takes the role of a humanoid cat which has to destroy a toothpaste factory. It it full of defensive mechanics and enemies and therefore it is fortunate that the protagonist is armed and can jump. The scrolling levels are shown from the side and have usually maze-like structures. The goal of each level is to find the exit which requires to solve simple puzzles (using switches and finding keys) in order to open new ways to explore. Of course it is also important to stay alive: hits reduce the protagonist's energy bar which eventually results in a life loss - more are earned by gaining enough points. Helpful are the various power-ups which can be collected on the way, e.g. energy refills, better weapons or bombs.",
