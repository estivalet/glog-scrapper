  "description": "The Island of Lost Hope is a text-adventure with a pirate theme. The parser has standard <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Infocom\">Infocom</a>-like abilities: it understands pronouns, chain commands,etc.\nYou play a character whose ship was attacked by a pirate called Captain Black. Stranded on a small island, one day you have the chance to infiltrate the captain's vessel and exact your revenge.\nThe screen is divided in 5 parts:\n- a top-left porthole where the graphics and the odd animation are displayed;\n- a compass in the center in the form of a skull that can be clicked with the sword-shaped cursor for movement (its use is optional, the player can also type the cardinal points and the up and down directions directly on the parser screen);\n- a top-right map that shows your current position and the explored surrounding area;\n- the screen bottom, the larger part of it being reserved for the parser and its messages;\n- the smaller right-bottom inventory that lists your possessions.\nNo music, but there is some sound, mostly soothing splash noises from the sea.",
