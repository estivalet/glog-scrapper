  "description": "<i>FootMan</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> variant. It features two game modes, new taste and classic, as well as an editor for creating new levels. However the two game modes play the same, with only the graphics being different. In the classic mode we get Pac-Man as we are used to see him as well as ghosts chasing him. In the new taste mode the player character has feet (and a pair of red sneakers) and is chased by four blobby-like characters. Otherwise the two modes are identical. The rules are the same as in the original: the player has to collect all the pills to complete a level and can pick up power pills to go after the chasers. There are also various sorts of fruits that in this version move around the mazes. All in all there are fifty different mazes and they can be played in any order. The game also has a two player mode where both players compete at the same time and the same screen. ",
