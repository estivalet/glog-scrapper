  "description": "<i>Karate King</i> is a side view single screen beat 'em up in the same style as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kung-fu-the-way-of-the-exploding-fist\">The Way of the Exploding Fist</a>, as you must either try to beat the computer or another player. Using different joystick combinations, each player has various amounts of moves including punches, kicks and jumping and for every good hit the player gets a point. Once a player has three points then he has won the fight and moves on to the next opponent. A clock counts down and the winner of the fight is the one with the most points.",
