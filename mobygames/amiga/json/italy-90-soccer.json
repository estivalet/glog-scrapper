  "description": "In the game, trying to predict the events of 1990 World Cup \nheld in Italy, you may choose a team to play soccer and to win the championship.<br><br>On the field in third person side-scrolling view you may control the player with the ball or player nearest to the ball, moving him in eight directions, trying to get the ball, and performing the kick. Pressing the 'kick' key down will increase the power of the kick. The number of players in the field is unusual and consists of 7 players for each team including goalkeeper.<br><br>The game is available for 1-8 players, and it has slightly different range of computer AI's levels, game speeds, match durations, and countries in Amiga/C64 versions.",
