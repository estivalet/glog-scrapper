  "description": "<i>The Dodgy Game</i> is a very short point &amp; click graphic adventure about a young boy who wants to record the latest episode of his favorite TV show onto his home VCR. To do that, he will first need to get into his house (he's locked out), and prevent members of his family from impeding him in his quest.<br><br>The interface splits the screen vertically: the top half shows the current scene, and underneath is a panel that shows the inventory items you are currently carrying, as well as four action buttons: &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;Use&quot; and &quot;Pinch&quot; (as in British slang for &quot;take&quot;). Left-clicking the mouse selects an action button or an inventory item, or causes the main character to walk towards the clicked point on the scene. Right-clicking is used for performing an action on a scene object or character.",
