  "description": "<i>Holo-Squash</i> is a futuristic sports game that is transmitted to its players through extra sensorial perception from a distant planet. Like in traditional squash it features two players in a enclosed court who take turns hitting a ball towards a wall. What's different is that the wall has two sets of eight circles and the players score points by hitting these. A match consists of three sets and the player with the highest score when all three have been played will win. In the first set the aim is to conquer more circles than the opponent. The second set works the same but now hitting an already conquered circle will give it away to the opponent. The third set is the most difficult and the aim is to conquer three circles.<br><br>The game can be played by one or two players. When playing alone the player will compete against three AI opponents in order, each new one harder than the previous one.",
