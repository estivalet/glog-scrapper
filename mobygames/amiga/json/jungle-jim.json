  "description": "<i>Jungle Jim</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> variant where the titular hero has to be guided through a jungle. He has to collect all the gold and avoid the hostile natives and wild animals that roam about. By eating a banana Jim can go after the enemies who turn green and when catching them they turn white and return back to where they started. Once all gold has been collected a hut will appear and by reaching it the player progresses to the next level. At times a dagger will appear briefly and if collected it can be used as a weapon and be thrown at the enemies. It can however only be used three times. <br><br>The game has a total of fifty different levels. If that's not enough there is also a built in editor that allows the player to modify levels or to create all new ones.",
