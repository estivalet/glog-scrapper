  "description": "<i>Pacman 87</i> is a single player, shareware game based on the classic <i>PacMan</i>.<br><br>As is usual for games like this the player races round a maze eating pills to collect points. They are pursued by four ghosts and any contact with a ghost is fatal unless a  big powerpill has just been eaten in which case the player can kill the ghost and gain extra points.<br><br>Unlike other games the player does not have to clear a level of pills to progress to the next as there are doorways on the edge of the screen which lead from one top another. Another uncommon feature are hazards such as fire pits, wall-mounted blades etc which will kill also the player \n",
