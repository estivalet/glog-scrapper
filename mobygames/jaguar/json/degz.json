  "description": "Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Scramble\">Scramble</a>, <i>Degz</i> is a horizonal-scrolling arcade-style shoot 'em where you take control of a spaceship through a variety of terrains in order to inflitrate an enemy base and destroy it, while avoiding enemy ships and incoming obstacles along the way that will try to stop your progress, but you're armed with both guns and bombs to counterattack them. Watch your fuel gauge and refill your ship by blowing up fuel depots that occasionally appear on the ground, otherwise be prepared to explode once you run out of fuel.",
