  "description": "<i>Towers II: Plight of the Stargazer</i>, a single-player, single-character, first-person RPG, is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/towers-lord-baniffs-deceit\">Towers</a> which was released for the Falcon system.<br><br>This game begins where the first one left off - you and your party are shipwrecked on the island of Lamini. The crew has spent several months making repairs to their ship, but before they are able to leave the Sheriff of Lamini pleads for help. It seems that one of the island's highest ranking council members, the wizard Lord Daggan, has completely lost his senses. All sorts of strange and unusual things have been happening. He has been ranting and raving, blowing things up, and digging up the corpses of dead mystics. Daggan has remained locked up inside his castle and no one sent to confront him has been heard from since. So naturally you accept the quest.<br><br>Begin by selecting a character from the four available: Merton, the wizard; Tasler, the boy; Andros, the circus performer; or Gerand, the fighter. Then roll until you get the statistics you like for Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity and Constitution. Each of the characters has his own specialty.<br><br>The entire game takes place within Daggan's tower. There are 11 floors, which you can move between freely via stairs, teleporters, and the occasional levitation through a hole in the floor. There are no shops for buying and selling, so you must use what you find in the castle. As you progress through the levels, various mini-quests present themselves (charging an artifact, forging a sword, for instance). Most puzzles have been designed so they can be solved two different ways. Music plays throughout the game and the sounds of doors opening and closing, your footsteps, monster footsteps, etc. can be heard.",
