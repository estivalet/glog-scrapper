  "description": "In <i>Custodian</i> the player takes the role of the caretaker of an nuclear-powered alien cemetery. It was infested by parasites which drain the energy and the player's job is to fend them off.<br><br>There are three tombs, each of them are extensive environments which scroll in multiple directions. The player uses a jet pack for movement and searches for the pods which the parasites are using to extract the energy. They have to be brought to a special room to destroy them there. The goal is to get rid of all pods in a level, but the parasites have something against this. And so they actively try to kill the protagonist, but fortunately he has ten weapon systems at his disposal to shoot back. Well, at least if he bought them from special silos with earned points. The total energy reserves of the tomb act as time limit.",
