  "description": "<i>Atari Karts</i> is a character-based go-kart racing game. It plays very similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-kart\">Super Mario Kart</a>. The emphasis in this game, like most kart games, is on making use of pick-up items found around the track to knock out your opponents.<br><br>There is only one game mode, a points based cup series.  There are four difficulty levels, each with 3 cups to race for. After completing all the cups for a difficulty level, you get to challenge a &quot;boss&quot; kart in a single race match.  If you beat the boss, he becomes a playable character.  The various cup races can be played in either single player or two player split screen modes.",
