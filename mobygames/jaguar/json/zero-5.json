  "description": "<i>Zero 5</i> is a space shooter which places you in control of a small and maneuverable fighter craft, or a powerful warship, depending upon which level you play. Taking on the role of a pilot, you must defend the earth from alien attack with dozens of missions needed to succeed. Your tour of duty includes travelling through deep space to meet enemy convoys head on and shooting across asteroid and planet surfaces taking out installations.<br><br>There are three different play modes:\n<ul>\n<li>Hit-Pack Mode - Somewhat like a variation on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/missile-command-3d\">Missile Command 3D</a> VR mode. You are in a turret with four guns to blast everything in sight, including asteroids in several levels. Absence of power-ups make it more difficult.\n<li>Bambam Mode - Consists of piloting around in the fighter, shooting every object that moves, in 360 degrees. Includes power-ups for weapons, shields, and score.\n<li>Trench Mode - <i>Star Wars</i>-style shooting in your Bambam fighter, running along a trench. Also includes power-ups.</li></ul>",
