  "description": "<i>Super Golf</i> is an overhead golf game with one complete course of 18 holes. The controls follow the traditional two-click system: the power of the hit and the swerve are determined after pressing a button twice with the correct timing. The used club and the basic direction is set before the hit. Together with the used golfer's talents (putting, power, accuracy and luck) this is used to calculate the result of the hit. There are always four athletes competing; either human or AI controlled.",
