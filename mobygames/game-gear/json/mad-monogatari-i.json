Monogatari I</i> is a role-playing game. Featuring characters from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a> games, it is set in a 3D dungeon which you explore from first-person perspective.

You should hold down buttons and press direction arrows to execute various magic spells.",
