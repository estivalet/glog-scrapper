  "description": "This platforming game stars the titular robotic cat Doraemon from the anime of the same name. The player must traverse through the levels collecting cheeseburgers (all of them for a perfect score) and cat bells, while facing robotic enemies. Doraemon's methods of attacking are either jumping on enemies or shooting them with a projectile powerup. After every three levels, the player will need to defeat a boss enemy to proceed to the next stage.",
