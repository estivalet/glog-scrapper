  "description": "The 1993 action/comedy/fantasy film <i>Last Action Hero</i> received a unique adaptation for portable systems. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/last-action-hero___\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/last-action-hero\">versions</a>, the game combines side-scrolling action and driving, but has unique levels and gameplay mechanics.<br><br>The bulk of the game consists of side-scrolling platforming. The player controls action hero Jack Slater who has to find the level exit before the timer runs out. Standing in his way are the occasional bad guy, of which there are only two standard varieties: one is armed with a gun and rolling bombs, the other with a baseball bat. Slater can defeat them with punches or roundhouse kicks. Other obstacles can only be overcome by using special items, with the item available depending on the level. There are fire extinguishers, keys, bombs and upward-launching rockets. To get an item, Slater must collect a number of movie tickets flying in the air.<br><br>Two of the game's levels are driving-based. Seen from the top, the player controls Slater's car and must again reach the level end before the timer runs out. To do so, a turbo boost must be acquired (for a large jump or higher top speed), again by collecting movie tickets. Some tickets are floating above the road, others can only be acquired by ramming other cars and collecting them from the wreckage. Only the Game Gear version includes a small section recreating the &quot;chicken&quot; scenes from the film: Slater's and the bad guy's car are situated head-to-head and the player must mash buttons to survive the following head-on collision.<br><br>The game also includes a few boss fights against a helicopter and the movie villain The Ripper.",
