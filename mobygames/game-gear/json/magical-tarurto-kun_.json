  "description": "<i>Magical Tarur?to-kun</i> is a side-scrolling shooter based on the anime series of the same name. Tarur?to-kun, who can be described as a kind of magical super hero, flies through the levels while blasting away evil monsters. As the game is based on a humorous license, the enemies are unusual, e.g. a waking piano which throws with musical notes or jumping soccer balls. Tarur?to-kun can withstand three hits before dying. Occasionally he meets his associate Mimosa which leads him to a separate screen where he can choose one of the unlimited weapon systems, e.g. enemy-seeking rockets or a multi-shot. On offer are also power-ups which can be used only a limited times like sleeping gas or a power scream.",
