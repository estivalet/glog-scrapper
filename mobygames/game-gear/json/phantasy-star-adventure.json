  "description": "You are an agent of Paseo government on the planet Motavia. One day, on December 1268 A.W, you receive a letter at the base. The sender is Ken Miller, a scientist as well as an old friend of yours. He had immigrated to Dezolis to conduct his research years ago.  These are the contents of the letter: &quot;How are you?  I have succeeded in the discovery of the century. You must come and see it.&quot;<br><br>You travel to the planet Dezolis and visit a town called Carsonville. There, you find out that Dr. Miller has invented a machine that can make human beings immensely powerful. The problem is, Dr. Miller is kidnapped, along with his invention. With the help of his sister Layla you have to solve this mystery.<br><br>This game is a Japanese-style adventure game set in the <i>Phantasy Star</i> universe. The player interacts with the game world by choosing available options such as &quot;See&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, &quot;Move&quot;, etc. There are a few puzzles to solve and a few encounters with hostile characters (in a &quot;pseudo-RPG&quot; turn-based fashion), but the largest part of the game is dedicated to exploration and dialogue with the characters.",
