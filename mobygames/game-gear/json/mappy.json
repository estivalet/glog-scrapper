  "description": "You control Mappy, a police-mouse whose job is to collect valuables (consumer electronics) from a cat's house. You are being pursued by a gang of five pink cats. Doors are your only defense against the cats. You get from floor to floor by jumping on one of the trampolines.<br><br>Points are earned by recovering stolen goods. Other ways of earning points are bouncing on a trampoline, putting cats in the microwave, striking a cat with a door, striking cats with a bell, retrieving a treasure from the Boss cat Goro or dropping cats through a hole in the floor.\n",
