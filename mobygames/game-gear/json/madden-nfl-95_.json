In addition, an All-Madden team can be used in Exhibition games only. <br><br>The game features selectable quarter length, timeouts, flippable plays, freely definable audibles, quarterback substitutions, variable weather (which can be turned off for Exhibition games), optional color commentary from John Madden (called &quot;Maddenisms&quot; in the menu), and detailed stats. Gameplay is seen from a top-down perspective with the field scrolling vertically. During rushing plays and kick returns, the Game Gear's two buttons are used for a variety of moves by either tapping or holding: diving, hurdling, speed bursts and spins are possible.",
