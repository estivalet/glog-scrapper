  "description": "Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/james-pond-underwater-agent\"> first</a> game of the series, that was a mission-based game, and the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/james-pond-2-codename-robocod\"> second</a> one, where your character had unique abilities such as observing the whole level and growing to unlimited height, <i>James Pond 3</i> is a standard jump and run platform game. Pond can run very quickly (by holding down the A button) through large levels, which often contain steep mountain sides and other tricky areas. Once again, he has to oppose the evil scientist Maybe and his minions.",
