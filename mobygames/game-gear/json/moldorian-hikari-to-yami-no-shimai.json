  "description": "In the world of Moldorian two races humans and magi live in peace, until this peace is fractured by the recent appearance of monsters across the lands. A youth named Navarre and his companion Miria go on a small adventure but when Miria is kidnapped, Navarre gradually finds himself in the thick of the conflict. Many of the game's mechanics both in town, outdoors and combat work like Final Fantasy. The most significant feature in the combat system is pressing a button and direction together to perform an action. The player can have a maximum of two companions to go with Navarre. As the game progresses, the player will be joined by a different character at a certain point.",
