  "description": "<i>Godzilla: Kaijuu no Daishingeki</i> is a turn based strategy game, with some arcade elements. A player can play as Godzilla or similar monsters (kaiju), like Anguirus, and Fire Rodan. Should players want to support humanity they can play as the G-Force, a human defense force. Humans have monster killing tools such as, tanks, artillery and planes. Some monsters are unplayable enemies and both sides will have the chance to fight against them.<br><br>On the map, the game is a typical war strategy. The  player can move units on the map, and attack enemies. Battles have their own screen and animations. The fighting is quite arcade-like and simple, functioning  similarly to fighting games. When all units have used their actions points a turn ends. <br><br><i>Godzilla: Kaijuu no Daishingeki</i> has four maps, and an extra secret level.",
