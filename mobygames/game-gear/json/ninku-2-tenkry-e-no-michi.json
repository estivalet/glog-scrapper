  "description": "This game serves as a sequel to Ninku with F?suke and his party going on another journey to fight and defeat Kisumi once again. There are three modes including the Story Mode, a Battle Mode and a Player versus Player Mode. The story is now told in snapshots with character avatars. Combat encounters work a lot like the prequel with characters have their own moves, but the player fights single tough opponents instead of multiple weak opponents.",
