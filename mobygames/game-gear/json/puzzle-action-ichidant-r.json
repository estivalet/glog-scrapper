Twenty new minigames are present, including rocketship assembly, a batting contest, and hitting the brakes on a speeding car.<br><br>The game once again includes an arcade mode for one or two players. This time, the player is questing to rescue a kidnapped princess from an evil knight. There is also a quest mode which plays like a simple RPG, where battles are fought via minigames.
