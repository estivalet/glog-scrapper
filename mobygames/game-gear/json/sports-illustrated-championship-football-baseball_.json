While there is no NFL license, the included teams are based on the 1995 season and include the two expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville for a total of 30 teams. Gameplay is seen from a horizontally-scrolling view from above the field.

It allows the setting of game length from one to nine innings and the toggling of automatic running. 28 MLB-based teams are available (but without an official license).
