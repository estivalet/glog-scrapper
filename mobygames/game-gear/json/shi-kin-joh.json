  "description": "<i>Shi-Kin-Joh</i> (&quot;Forbidden City&quot;) is a puzzle game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/soko-ban\">Sokoban</a> in which the player must reach a goal by pushing oversized mahjong tiles which block the path. When two matching tiles are pushed next to each other, they disappear. Other types of tiles will lock any movable tiles that come in contact with them.<br><br>The Megadrive version includes five different sound &amp; graphics sets, dozens of puzzles to solve, and a &quot;special puzzle&quot; mode where the rules of the game are changed dramatically. There is also a puzzle construction mode where custom puzzles can be created. Game progress is saved using passwords.",
