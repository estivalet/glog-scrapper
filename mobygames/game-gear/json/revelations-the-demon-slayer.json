  "description": "<i>Revelations: The Demon Slayer</i> is a side-game (gaiden) of the <i>Megami Tensei</i> (<i>Megaten</i>) universe. Unlike all other <i>Megaten</i> games, this game is not set in modern-day or futuristic Japan. On a distant planet, a race resembling humans possess the ability to call upon a power called Gaia. The player takes the role of a young boy who learns the arts of Gaia. However, the land is in danger - an evil force is approaching. Assisted by his friends, the hero has to summon an army of demons and lead them in a war against the evil. <br><br>Like in all other <i>Megaten</i> games, the player can summon demons and fuse them, getting more powerful variants.",
