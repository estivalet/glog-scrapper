  "description": "<i>Tesserae</i> is a 2D combination of Rubik's Cube and the more advanced levels of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Q-Bert\">Q-Bert</a>. Simple yet colorful symbol graphics allow for endless hours of gameplay akin to how one can play <a id=\"d54dc86051444485495b4310249a5364e\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=MineSweeper\">MineSweeper</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> for a long duration. Gameplay consists of flipping tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal is to clear the board entirely. Higher levels have added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.",
