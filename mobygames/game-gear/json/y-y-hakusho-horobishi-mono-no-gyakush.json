  "description": "<i>Y? Y? Hakusho: Horobishi Mono no Gyakush?</i> is based on the manga / anime series <i>Y? Y? Hakusho</i>, which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an &quot;Underworld Detective&quot; after being killed in a car accident  while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world.<br><br>The game is a classic side-scrolling beat'em up and offers several characters from the manga to play. Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All characters have different values in five attributes like jumping or speed. The game offers some variations from the standard beat'em up formula: There are four different levels accessible from the beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after completing a level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights. By turns, the player has to dodge an attack from the boss and then do a attack on his own by pressing Punch at the time when a moving cross-hair is over the boss.",
