  "description": "The story of <i>Mad? Monogatari A</i> takes place at a time between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Madou+Monogatari+I\"> Mad? Monogatari I</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Madou+Monogatari+II\"> Mad? Monogatari II</a>. Arle, the heroine of the series, is a little girl who studies magic. One day, she goes into a forest, only to notice that something terrible happened to it and its inhabitants, the fairies. Is this the work of the archenemy, Satan-sama? That's what Arle has to find out!<br><br>Like most other <i>Mad? Monogatari</i> games, it takes place in 3D maze-like dungeons, which you should explore, find treasures, and fight enemies. The turn-based, random battles are viewed from the same first-person perspective as the dungeon exploration. You fight using a variety of magic spells.",
