  "description": "<i>Tom and Jerry: The Movie</i> is a tie-in to the 1992 animated film of the same name starring the famous cat &amp; mouse duo. It is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/tom-and-jerry-the-movie\">Master System</a> version in gameplay, but has its own story (which is unrelated to the film) and entirely new level designs.<br><br>Tom has found a treasure map while playing in the attic. With Tom dreaming about how to spend the treasure, Jerry grabs the map and runs away. Now Tom has to chase Jerry to get back the map, running after him through five different levels, starting from Tom's house and continuing in the city streets, a cruise ship, a deserted island and finally a hidden labyrinth.<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling platformer. Tom's goal is to catch Jerry who always runs along at the right side of the screen. If Tom gets close he can try to grab Jerry, which ends the level, but if he misses, he loses a small amount of health. If Tom can't catch Jerry before the level end, he has to face one of Jerry's friends in a small boss fight.<br><br>Multiple dangers abound in all levels: platforms that fall away under Tom, objects falling from the ceiling and bouncing along the way. Jerry himself also has tricks up his sleeve, throwing land mines and cherry bombs at Tom. If Tom gets hurt, he can refill his health by picking up a life potion.<br><br>After successfully completing a level, one of two bonus rounds follows: Tag is a labyrinth game. Seen from the top, Tom chases Jerry through a maze. Picking up heart icons refills Tom's health and catching Jerry before the timer runs out increases Tom's life bar. Apples and Bombs has Jerry dropping either apples or bombs from a row of windows. Tom must catch the apples but avoid the bombs, which stun him temporarily. Catching 3 apples refills health whereas getting 24 or more of them increases the life bar.",
