  "description": "A young adventurer arrives at a port town in pursuit of saving the lands from evil forces of Millennium. The player goes around towns, outdoor lands and dungeons throughout the adventure. Up to three members can join the adventurer's party at a time. In the typical Final Fantasy RPG style, towns have shops to purchase items and services as well as people to gather information, while the outdoor lands and dungeons have random appearing monsters which the player fights in turn-based combat. Later in the game, the player will be able to traverse across water with a ship.",
