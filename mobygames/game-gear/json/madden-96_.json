  "description": "<i>Madden 96</i> is the second and last iteration of the football franchise to appear on the Game Gear. It is based closely on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/madden-nfl-95_\">previous year's game</a>, with one important difference: it loses the NFL license, thus featuring only generic team names. Still, teams, stats and schedules are based on the 1995 NFL season, with the two new expansion teams and rule changes like the two-point conversion included.<br><br>The main game modes Exhibition, Season and Playoffs return unchanged from the previous game, and a new Sudden Death mode has been added. 30 teams plus the traditional All-Madden team are available. Features, controls and graphics (top-down vertically scrolling) are mostly unchanged from the previous game. The main changes are a redesigned frontend/menu system, reworked playbook, the addition of injuries, and substitutions now being available for all positions, not only quarterbacks.",
