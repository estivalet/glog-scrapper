  "description": "In the year 20XX, a U.F.O. lands in the area around Megalo City. A team is sent to investigate, but they find no trace of any life form inside. After a year has passed, the city's mayor, out of nowhere, decides to host a fighting tournament to determine the strongest fighter in the world. However, something sinister seems to be going on...<br><br><i>Masters of Combat</i> is a versus fighting game, where you choose one of the final four participants in the tournament and need to defeat your three opponents and yourself in a mirror match, before you can take on the final boss. Unlike most fighters, the game does not use &quot;up&quot; on the D-pad for jumping, but one of the other buttons, leaving one button for punches and kicks.<br><br>The game has three levels of difficulty, but the easiest mode ends after four of the five fights.",
