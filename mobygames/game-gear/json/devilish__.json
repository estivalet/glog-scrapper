  "description": "Gamma has kidnapped the hero's love and has her being held hostage at his Evil Temple hideout. The hero must defeat Gamma's forces in order to rescue his love.<br><br><i>Devilish</i> is a Breakout variant. Instead of the screen remaining stationary, the game screen will scroll forward once the ball (called a power orb in this game) passes through a barrier. The game consists of eight stages. Players control a paddle and have to hit a power orb at barriers in order to break through them and the orb can also be used to destroy enemies too. The paddle itself can be configured into four different formations which are an offensive and defensive position and an L and reverse L formation. <br><br>Stages must be completed before time expires. Stages also contain treasure chests that can contain either a time bonus, a 1-Up, a Buster Ball that can break through any barrier, and a Flash Bomb which will destroy any blocks surrounding it when it explodes.<br><br>The game offers a regular game mode and a time trial mode. The time trial only includes the first six stages. Options let the player choose between an easy, normal, or hard difficulty and also let the player select the number of power orbs they have available at the start.",
