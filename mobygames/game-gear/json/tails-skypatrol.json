  "description": "<i>Tails' Skypatrol</i> is the first solo adventure of the Sonic sidekick Tails in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series and it was only released in Japan.<br><br>While flying around, Tails discovers an island. It seems to be completely abandoned except for some mine cart tracks. As he lands on the island a cart approaches, and Tails hides in the bushes. The passing silver cart is driven by a woman who says she is Wendy Witchcart. She proclaims that everything on the island is hers and threatens to transform everyone in crystal who does not follow her rules. Tails, determined to save all the animals on the island, sets in a chase to the Witchcart.<br><br>Gameplay is fairly similar to the Sonic series. Tails need to defeat enemies and complete obstacles. He can fly, but is constantly suspended. He carries a golden ring that is used to take out enemies or to latch on to devices. Sonic, the emeralds and Dr. Robotnik are not presented, and neither are there rings to collect during the levels.<br><br>The game came to other territories as an unlockable minigame in the GameCube version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sonic+Adventure+DX%3a+Director%27s+Cut\">Sonic Adventure DX</a> and as one of the titles in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sonic+Gems+Collection\">Sonic Gems Collection</a>.",
