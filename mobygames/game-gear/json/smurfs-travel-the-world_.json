  "description": "The magic crystal has broken. And so inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette are teleported through time and all around the world. Sadly they discover that the whole world suffers from pollution. They set off to find the 21 crystals in each area and smurf the world's rubbish in order to get back to their European village. <br><br>So you as male Smurf or female Smurfette should travel from one continent to another. The continents represent North Pole, Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia, and each of them consists of 3 levels. On each level character should collect certain number of crystal shards, which in sum gives 21 crystal shards. During the level character should collect other items to raise a score, avoid or eliminate the enemies specific for each area jumping over them, swim somewhere, or run away from cougar. <br><br>Certain parts of the game may be accessed via password.<br><br>The game is available in French/English/Spanish/German.",
