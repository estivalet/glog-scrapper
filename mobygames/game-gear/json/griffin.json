  "description": "<i>Griffin</i> is a futuristic action game in which the player controls a tank. The goal is to beat four horizontally scrolling levels. The tank can be moved freely in order to shoot enemies and dodge obstacles. There are four weapons available: regular shots, torpedoes, grenades and a limited supply of smart bombs. Getting hit decreases the life energy, but it can be refilled by collecting power-ups. The reward for beating a level is a still picture of the female tank pilot.",
