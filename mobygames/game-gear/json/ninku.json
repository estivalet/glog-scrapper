  "description": "Based on the anime of the same name, the game has the young ninja F?suke and his trusty penguin fighting the evil Empire and reuniting the Ninku corps to ultimately defeat the turncoat Kisumi. Much of the game makes use of static cutscenes and dialogue. Combat takes the form of action fighting, requiring the player to beat opponents one after the other. As the game progresses, the player will have additional characters to join F?suke's party, some of which can be selected to fight in F?suke's place, having their own unique moves.",
