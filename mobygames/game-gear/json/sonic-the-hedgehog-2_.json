  "description": "Coming back from the vacation Sonic took after foiling the plans of Dr Robotnik, he finds that Tails and all his other animal friends are missing. Sonic finds a letter waiting for him, that reads:<br><br><i>&quot;Dear Sonic,<br><br>Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds.<br><br>Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!<br><br>Sincerely, Tails.&quot;</i><br><br>That being more than enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again.<br><br>The Master System version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also <b>not</b> do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.",
