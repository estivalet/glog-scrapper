Nick, the Prince of Cypress, that was conquered by Iom, had his hand turned into stone during the last battle, and therefore cannot wield his legendary Sword of Hajya. Nevertheless, he tries to recruit people who would help him to gain his kingdom back.<br><br>The game is a strategy RPG. You command a large party composed of several units, and most of the game is spent in battles. The turn-based battles occupy the entire location; during your turn, you command your troops to move around and to attack. Your main heroes gain levels in a RPG fashion.",
