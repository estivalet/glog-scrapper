  "description": "<i>Tempo Jr.</i> is a platforming game and sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tempo+32x\">Tempo</a> on the Sega 32X. The player again takes control of the cute grasshopper Tempo and guides him through various stages. The goal in each level is just to find the exit. Each level consists of two stages and a boss fight. After finishing a level, Tempo can take part in a mini game if he found coins in the completed level and win additional points or lives. Tempo can shoot notes from his hands to stun enemies, which will then automatically be kicked away on contact. He can also use his wings to move faster, float in the air or fall more slowly and more controlled.",
