  "description": "<i>The Berlinwall</i> is the Game Gear version of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Berlinwall\">The Berlinwall</a>. While the gameplay mechanics are identical, there are some significant changes. Foremost, the game adds a story: the player takes the role of a boy who searches for his mother who wanted to visit a neighbour town. Unfortunately, the only thing he finds is a huge wall. When trying to sneak through a hole, he is transported to a strange, hostile place...<br><br>Each level (one non-scrolling screen) consists of several platforms which are interconnected with ladders. Another thing which is found in the levels are monsters which walk around and try to catch and kill the main character. His only way of defense is the hammer which is used to punch holes in the platforms: when monsters walk over them, they get stuck. When using the hammer on those trapped monsters, the platform is filled up again, the monster falls down and is killed. There are two added benefits: a falling monsters is deadly to other monsters and it leaves a power-up behind, e.g. an extension of the time limit or a stronger hammer.. Sometimes the player encounters boss monsters which require a bigger hole.<br><br>While some levels are based on the arcade version, others are different. This version also adds a shop where the player can buy power-ups. It can be visited before taking on the world's boss.",
