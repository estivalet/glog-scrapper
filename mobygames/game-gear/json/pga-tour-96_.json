  "description": "The Game Gear version of <i>PGA Tour 96</i> is the last entry in the series on the platform. It has a different selection of courses, licensed PGA golfers and modes compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Genesis\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=DOS\">versions</a>. The three available courses are Sawgrass, Summerlin and River High. The five game modes are <i>Practice</i>, <i>Putting</i>, <i>Driving</i>, <i>Skins</i> and <i>Tournament</i>. Up to four players taking turns on the same Game Gear are supported.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to many other games of the genre: the player is shown an overhead view of the map and then taken to a perspective directly behind the golfer. Using the D-pad to move a cursor on screen to aim their shot and pressing a main button to activate the power/accuracy meter below, pressing once to set the power and again for accuracy. ",
