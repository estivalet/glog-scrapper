  "description": "<i>Fray: Shugyouhen</i> is a midquel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Xak\">Xak</a>. The demons of Zekisis have managed to invade the world of Xak. Fray goes on a quest to slay the demons and save the villages on the way. The player's default attack consists of single projectiles, but the player can collect power-ups for more widespread shots as well as different special elemental attacks (with mana pickups to power them). At the end of each stage, the player will have to defeat a boss, before stopping at a village, getting information and upgrades and then proceeding to the next stage.",
