  "description": "<i>Cliffhanger</i> is based on the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106582/\">1993 Sylvester Stallone movie</a>. The lead character, Gabe Walker, is an expert in high mountain search and rescue and receives a distress signal from a plane that has crashed nearby. However, the plane is actually loaded with terrorists who hijacked a large shipment of cash. The game consists of side-scrolling action. The hero can walk, run, jump, punch, and kick while jumping. Further, he can perform special feats as the situation requires, such as crossing a rope suspended from two cliffs. One of the biggest threats in this game is nature as Gabe must defend against wolves and birds, snow falling off cliffs and structures, and falling rocks.",
