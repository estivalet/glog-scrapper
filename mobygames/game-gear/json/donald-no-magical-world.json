  "description": "When Grimace opens a box labelled &quot;do not open&quot;, Donald McDonald and all of his friends get sucked into a magical world with no choice but to find their way out. The player takes on the role of Donald, travelling through different-themed worlds to rescue his friends and find his way back home. Donald wields a magic cane to whack enemies, and can also use an umbrella to glide through the air. Some graphics and music are shared with Treasure's better-known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mcdonalds-treasure-land-adventure\">McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure</a>, but the gameplay and level design in this game is completely different.",
