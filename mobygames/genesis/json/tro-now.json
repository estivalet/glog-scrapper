  "description": "<i>Tro-Now</i> is a variant of the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tron\">Tron</a> light cycle game for up to four players simultaneously. The homebrew game was originally created for the 2015 bitbitJAM competition. On a single screen shown using a top-down view the bikes move forward at a fixed speed and can only be made to rotate 90 degrees left or right. They leave behind a trail in the same colour of the bike and have to avoid crashing into each other's vehicle or trail / wall.<br><br>While lives are endless, points are scored while moving, so the player that keeps riding without crashing keeps gaining points. After three minutes the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. The game can also be played in single-player, with the option to go against two or four riders. When in multiplayer the four players use two gamepads: one player uses left and right to steer and the other the A and B buttons on the same gamepad.",
