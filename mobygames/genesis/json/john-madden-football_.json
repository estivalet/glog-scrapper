  "description": "Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=John+Madden+Football\">the first computer versions</a>, this game originated on consoles and focuses on the action on the field instead of detailed strategy. There is still a detailed range of moves available, all grouped for quick selection.<br><br>Game play modes include regular season, playoffs and sudden death. The game features 16 regular teams plus one All-Madden team, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Play actions include selecting a pass recipient as a play unfolds, block tackles, dives and sackings. Different weather conditions come into play when it's wet, snowy or muddy.",
