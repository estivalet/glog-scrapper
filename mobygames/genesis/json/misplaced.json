  "description": "<i>Misplaced</i> is a homebrew puzzle game. The player directly controls the character Hara who wakes up on a small island floating in the clouds. This happens every day. Every level is a puzzle where a yellow key needs to be located. To reveal the key one or more red jewels need to be picked up and taken to a white square. Gradually different types of puzzle mechanics are introduced, often by a character called Hatter in the environment.<br><br>Each level consists of a single, fixed screen. There are enemies such as ghosts present that need to be avoided. The main puzzle mechanic is the ability to stop time, record movement and then play back that movement at a different location. For instance Hara can stop time, move three steps down, three step left and three steps up. By recording and then launching this movement pattern at a different location, it becomes possible to move past a wall by walking on the air. This mechanic can be used as often as possible, but only one pattern can be stored and the amount of moves per pattern is limited.<br><br>The ROM download release of the game contains both English and Russian versions.",
