  "description": "<i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms V</i> is the fifth game in the popular turn-based strategy game series, based on the classic medieval Chinese novel &quot;San Guo&quot; (&quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;). The novel, written by Luo Guanzhong, is perhaps the most popular classic book in China and all countries influenced by the Chinese culture (such as Japan). Its events occur in the third century AD, during the Later Han Dynasty. Several army leaders (the most important ones being Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Jian) are trying to unite China under their rule, and each one strives to defeat his opponents.<br><br><i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms V</i> offers many innovations. You won't only participate at wars, but also manage your country, and learn resource management of people and goods. A new &quot;Reputation&quot; parameter directly affects the people's opinion of you as the leader. Multiplayer allows participation of up to eight players (playing the eight main characters).<br><br>The game was never translated into English. It was released in Japan for the PC (both DOS and Windows), and for PlayStation. A Chinese translation of the game (DOS version) is available.",
