The gameplay is a side-scrolling action game, controlling Normy and fighting off various bad guys scattered throughout the stage using weapons such as glove extending hammers or beaver mallets.  There are also puzzles that need to be solved at times to advance on, various pitfalls and traps to avoid, and six different bosses to fight.",
