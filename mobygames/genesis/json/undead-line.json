  "description": "<i>Undead Line</i> is a top-down arcade shooter with scrolling screens, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Senjou+No+Ookami\">Commando</a> and other games. The player controls a character (from a selection of three on the MSX 2 version) that shoots projectiles at enemy monsters.<br><br>The six levels available are presented in a menu and can be selected and played in any order. There is a boss battle at the end of each one.<br><br>Chests with power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. They open when shot, and in the Genesis version it is possible to cycle through the available power-ups by keeping firing at them. The power-ups include armor and speed boosts, and several types of projectiles.",
