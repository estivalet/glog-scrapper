  "description": "<i>Miniplanets</i> is a homebrew and open source arcade-like game. The player controls the character Qisha through around the globes of 3D planets that wrap around with platformer-centric gameplay. The game consists of five planelagos of nine miniplanets each, of which Qisha is the protector. Each planelago used to be guarded by one of his children, but one day they were turned into statues by an unknown force. Qisha needs to go through each planelago to retrieve crystals that bring back his children and banish the force.<br><br>Qisha can be moved in eight directions and only a single button is used to jump. To complete a level he needs to reach a coloured area after first collecting all keys in the environment. Each planelago has a different theme. Challenges include avoiding deadly water, navigating past moving platforms, avoiding bombs and electricity, staying on conveyor belts etc.<br><br>With the default game option only 60 seconds are provided to complete a miniplanet, but this setting can be changed. Qisha starts with five lives and an encounter with a hazard is deadly right away. Extra lives are provided for every 15,000 points, but this setting too can be changed. A password system is used with a password for each completed planelago. Points are scored by completing miniplanets quickly, as the remaining time is converted into points.<br><br>The game received a cartridge release in 2017 courtesy of PlayOnRetro with a PVC box and reversible cover, translucent violet cartridge, full colour manual and a postcard.",
