  "description": "<i>Oh Mummy Genesis</i> is an unofficial enhanced remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/oh-mummy\">Oh Mummy</a>. The player controls one of two adventurers sent to Egypt by the British Museum to collect a set of five royal mummies and all the treasure they can carry. Gameplay takes the form of a single-screen maze game, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>. Each floor of the dungeon has a grid of sarcophagi; the player must walk a full circle around a sarcophagus to open it, and must collect at least one key and one treasure before moving on to the next level. Unlike the original game, <i>Oh Mummy Genesis</i> features a slightly more involved story and each tomb is capped off with a boss battle.<br><br>In addition to the remake, a faithful port of the original Amstrad CPC version of <i>Oh Mummy</i> is also included.<br><br>After the initial print run sold out, the game's ROM was made available for free download from its official website.",
