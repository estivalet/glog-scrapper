  "description": "The Sega Channel version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sonic-3d-blast\">Sonic 3D Blast</a> was split into two parts due to memory limitations. This second part contains the final three zones (Volcano Valley, Gene Gadget, Panic Puppet) and the last boss. In order to play, players have to enter a password earned from beating <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sonic-3d-blast-part-one\">Sonic 3D Blast: Part One</a>; this starts them off at Volcano Valley with their score and lives from Part One intact.",
