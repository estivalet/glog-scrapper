  "description": "<i>Spirou</i> is a platform side-scroller based on popular Franco-Belgian comic strip <i>Spirou et Fantasio</i>. The story begins in New York where famous inventor Count of Champignac is about to present his latest inventions. Journalists Spirou and Fantasio, Count’s most faithful friends are also there. Suddenly an evil robot woman Cyanida (originally called Cyanure), known to be obsessed with the plans to enslave humanity, appears and abducts the scientist! There’s no time to loose, so Spirou and his pet squirrel Spip rush to the rescue, while Fantasio stays back to dig for more information.   <br><br>The player controls Spirou. He is able to jump, duck, climb ladders and cliffs and run fast if the player holds down the action button. In the fourth level Spirou gets a gun to stand a chance against the increasing numbers of Cyanida’s minions. Spirou’s quest will see him travel through city streets and rooftops, a toy store, subway, Palombian swamp and jungle and other locations in over 12 levels.  <br><br>The player only gets 3 lives and no continues to beat the game. A single password is granted after beating the first half of the game. ",
