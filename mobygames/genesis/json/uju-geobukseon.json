  "description": "In the year 2020, the computer controlling the world has been corrupted by a virus and is out of control. Scentists create a warship, the &quot;Space Turtle Battleship&quot;, to fight against it. Two young pilots, Titi and Koti, take the helm and blast off to fight the out-of-control computer.<br><br><i>Uju Geobukseon</i> (&quot;Space Turtle Battleship&quot;) is a vertically-scrolling shooter in which the player controls the titular battleship. Like most any scrolling shooter, the player must shoot down various enemies without allowing the ship to be hit and destroyed, and there is a large boss waiting at the end of each stage. The ship has two different modes of fire, which will shoot in different directions; if three power-ups are collected, the number of bullets fired will increase. There are three difficulty settings available.",
