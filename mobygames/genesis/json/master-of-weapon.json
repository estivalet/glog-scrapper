  "description": "The &quot;7-Day War&quot; -- seven days of nuclear winter -- have caused massive ecological shifts on Earth. The ground splits open, the oceans boil, and all living things on the planet begin to change...including humanity. Scientists create a computer to leave a seed and restore humanity, a computer known simply as &quot;N&quot;, which is part of the top-secret Project Yukiwo. What is Project Yukiwo? None who know remain...<br><br><i>Master of Weapon</i> is a vertically-scrolling shooter. The player controls the fighter ship &quot;N&quot;, shooting various biological enemies. Powerups are sparse, with only a handful of upgrades available from item pods. The player can fire in the air, as well as towards the ground to hit land-based enemies. There is also a special weapon which can be changed with powerups, but also takes time to recharge back to full stock. There are a total of nine &quot;acts&quot;, and three difficulty settings.",
