  "description": "Trouble is in the kingdom of Dilsarl: the young, beautiful princess Salasa was abducted by the evil arch-mage Balrog. The king seeks help from the four best warriors of the country. The task is clear, but not so simple: find Balrog, destroy his evil minions and other monsters roaming the land, and rescue the princess.<br><br><i>Cadash</i> is a platform action role-playing game. The player chooses one of the four character classes in the beginning of the game: fighter, priestess, mage, or ninja (the Genesis version has only two characters: fighter and mage). The protagonist fights his or her way through dungeons, attacking physically or casting spells (as priestess or mage). Like in regular platform games, there are places where the player character is required to jump, duck, or climb. The protagonist gains experience for defeating monsters, and their level rises in a true RPG fashion.",
