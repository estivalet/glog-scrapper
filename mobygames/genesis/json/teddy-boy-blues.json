  "description": "<i>Teddy Boy Blues</i> is an updated conversion of the 1985 Sega coin-op action platformer. While the basic premise is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/teddy-boy\">Master System version</a> -- each stage contains a number of enemy generators, and enemies must be shot and collected before they take a portion of the time meter -- this version of the game has several differences. The graphics have been redrawn to take advantage of the more powerful hardware and the Yohko Ishino tie-in has been removed. There are also several new stages throughout the game, though many of the original game's stages are also present.",
