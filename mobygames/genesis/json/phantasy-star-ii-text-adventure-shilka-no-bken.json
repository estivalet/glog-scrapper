  "description": "This game is one of the eight text adventures that chronicles the lives of characters before their story continues in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/phantasy-star-ii\">Phantasy Star II</a>. This particular game covers Shir Gold, a child of a wealthy family who is bored with her mundane life and turns to becoming a thief for the thrills it brings. The goal of the game is to steal an expensive painting from a hotel exhibit without getting caught.<br><br>Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot.<br><br>Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP. <br><br>It is actually possible to lose at this game. For example, if Shir sets off a security alarm, it could lead to the game being over.",
