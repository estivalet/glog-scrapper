  "description": "The year is 2049. An alien armada assaults the Solar System. You are a nameless hero whose mission is to board the enemy's main battle cruiser and to disable all sixteen of its main plasma nodes.  A special Battle Frenzy chip (code name Bloodshot) is implanted into your neural net, making you the one ultimate soldier on whom the entire humanity depends now.<br><br>This is a 3D first-person shooter. You move through maze-like corridors of the alien ship, getting weapons and items, and blasting everything you encounter on your way. There is also a two players mode with split screens.",
