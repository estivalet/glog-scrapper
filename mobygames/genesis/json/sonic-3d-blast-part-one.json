This first part contains the first four zones (Green Grove, Rusty Ruin, Spring Stadium, and Diamond Dust). Upon completing them, the player is given a password that allows them to continue from the first zone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sonic-3d-blast-part-two\">Sonic 3D Blast: Part Two</a> while keeping their lives and score.",
