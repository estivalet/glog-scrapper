  "description": "<i>ESPN Speed World</i> is a generic racing game that is made to resemble NASCAR.  The player is given a stock car and can tune the car from the angle of the spoiler, to the setting of the shocks, and up to the pressure of the tires.<br><br>There are three different types of speedways to race on: <i>Super Speedway</i>, <i>Short Track</i> and <i>Road Courses</i>  with 5 different tracks for each to choose from.  Players can choose to race against the computer that has all 23 other stock cars on the track at once or play head-to-head on a split screen against a friend.<br><br>It also featured realistic driving physics.  While it didn't have a NASCAR license, it did have ESPN which broadcasted the races and had NASCAR analyst, Dr. Jerry Punch, who lent his voice to the game for the color commentary.",
