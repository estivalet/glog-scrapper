  "description": "Children growing up in the early 90s were worried about impending environmental doom. The popular <i>Captain Planet</i> cartoons told them they were doomed, unless a superhero could be formed by a multinational group of youths (the <i>Planeteers</i> of the title), to take on the polluters and deforesters.<br><br>Each of the five levels of this platform game has a specific mission and boss, and is undertaken by a specific Planeteer. These involve destroying hazards, shooting enemies, moving across suspended poles, and jumping onto ledges. <br><br>You have four energy and four power units - more can be collected up to a limit of 8, and they will always be recharged to four (if necessary) when you reach a boss. You have an unlimited standard shot and a more powerful Super shot, which drains power.",
