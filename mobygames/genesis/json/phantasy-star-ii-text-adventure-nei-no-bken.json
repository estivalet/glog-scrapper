  "description": "This game is one of the eight text adventures that chronicles the lives of characters before their story continues in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/phantasy-star-ii\">Phantasy Star II</a>. This particular game covers Nei, a half human, half bio-monster girl. She was found wandering around all alone and was then adopted by a middle aged couple. One day, a mob of villagers burned  down Nei's adopted parents house with them inside it. Nei escapes and now she wanders around aimlessly  through different villages, while being left with the terrible memories of the mob leader who ordered her house to be destroyed.<br><br>Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot. <br><br>Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP. ",
