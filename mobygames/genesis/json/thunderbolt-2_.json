  "description": "<i>Thunderbolt 2</i> is a vertically-scrolling top-down shooter set in space. The player controls a space ship that is Earth's last hope for survival. The ship can be freely moved around the screen and it has an unlimited amount of bullets, both for the primary weapon and the side weapon. The ship has three lives but multiple hits can be taken through a life bar. Both weapons can be upgraded several levels through power-ups left behind by enemies. They also drop bombs that can be picked up to clear the entire screen. The game consists of several stages (rounds) and keeps that of the high score. Enemies typically appear in waves with different patterns.",
