  "description": "This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade game. There are two modes, <i>Grind Stormer</i> and <i>V Five</i>. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.<br><br>In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In <i>Grind Stormer</i> the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant <i>V Five</i> takes a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a>-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.<br><br>The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a &quot;Special&quot; power-up granting four wingmen.",
