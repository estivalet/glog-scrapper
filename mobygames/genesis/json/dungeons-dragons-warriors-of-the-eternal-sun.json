  "description": "<i>Dungeon &amp; Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun</i> is set in the world of Mystara, a setting of the <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> game. The characters find themselves in a strange, red-hued world in which the horizon slopes upward in all directions, eventually vanishing into a crimson haze at the limits of sight. Their mission is to find and make allies in this new world or else the kingdom and its culture will perish.<br><br>The player leads a party of four characters (either the default party or one that the player has created). Characters and races can be chosen from the normal D&amp;D options. The game world is viewed from a bird's eye view perspective and the characters can roam around in real time. Battles are turn based. Like most role-playing games, the gaming experience focuses on exploration, inventory management and character development. ",
