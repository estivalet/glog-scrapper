  "description": "<i>Sonic Eraser</i> is a puzzle game very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Columns\">Columns</a> that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:<ul><li><b>Round</b>: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.</li><br>\n<li><b>Normal</b>: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.</li><br>\n<li><b>Doubt</b>: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.</li><br>\n<li><b>Block</b>: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.</li></ul>These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.",
