  "description": "<i>Alisia Dragoon</i> is the female protagonist of this fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an evil demon and avenge her fathers death through eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, her quest is no easy task as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.<br><br>During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.",
