The queen Velvet sent the cute little fairy Silk to seek aid by the red-haired witch Cotton, the only one who could defeat Wool. Cotton agrees under one condition: she will receive some willows as a reward, since willows are her favorite food. Finally, after defeating Wool, Cotton realized that someone poisoned the promised willows, and swears revenge. Accompanied by Silk, she begins to chase the mysterious enemy.<br><br><i>Panorama Cotton</i> is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-harrier\"> Space Harrier</a>, set in an anime-style fantasy world.
