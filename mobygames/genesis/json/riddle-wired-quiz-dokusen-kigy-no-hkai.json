  "description": "A terrorist group has taken control of an armed satellite and is attacking all the nations of the Earth. Your mission: infiltrate and recapture the satellite...by answering trivia questions. <i>Riddle Wired</i> is a Japanese-style quiz game, and despite the scenario, the entirety of the game consists of answering general knowledge questions. The player will face a series of different opponents during the mission, and each one will ask the player a series of questions in a so-called &quot;Quiz Battle&quot;. If the player answers correctly, the enemy will lose HP; if not, then the player will lose HP. If the enemy's HP is drained, the player moves on to the next stage, but if all HP is lost then the game is over. One or two players can play simultaneously.",
