  "description": "<i>Fix-It Felix Jr.</i> is a homebrew game that presents itself as a port of the fictional 1984 game of the same title by the fictional TobiKomi Corporation from the 2012 animated <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Disney\">Disney</a> movie <i>Wreck-it Ralph</i>. The gameplay draws inspiration from titles like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Donkey+Kong\">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wrecking-crew\">Wrecking Crew</a>.<br><br>Ralph is on the Niceland apartment building where he has smashed its windows. It is now up to Felix it to fix that. The building consists of several floors with vertical, 2D scrolling as Felix moves up. Felix needs to fix all the windows without time pressure. He can move freely and jumps up or moves down. Meanwhile Ralph moves around on the top level and drops bricks that hurt Felix, who starts with three lives. Every hit removes one. When Felix gets too close, Ralph moves higher until the top of the building is reached.<br><br>200 points are scored for each fixed window and the game keeps track of the high scores. There are also birds that fly in a horizontal line and appear from the side of the screen. Felix receives a medal at the top of the building and then the residents throw off Ralph, which ends the game.<br><br>It is not identical to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Fix-It+Felix+Jr%2e\">the game of the same name</a> released in the same year by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Airwalk+Studios\">Airwalk Studios</a>.",
