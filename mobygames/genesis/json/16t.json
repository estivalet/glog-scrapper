  "description": "<i>16t</i> is a scrolling platform action game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/teddy-boy\">Teddy Boy</a>, in which the player controls a youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling &quot;slots&quot; meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.",
