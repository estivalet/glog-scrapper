  "description": "Two cowboys try to win a girl's heart by racing each other in side-scrolling run-and-jump obstacle courses. The first to arrive will get her love. The duel takes you through six worlds with three levels each.  In order to move on to the next world, you have to destroy the vehicle of your opponent, who has kidnapped the girl in each final level. Both singleplayer and multiplayer modes have horizontal split screens, which can be used strategically to slow down your rival.<br><br>The cowboys can jump, pick up weapons and dash at regular intervals to gain some extra speed. In order to win the level, you need to make use of the many obstacles. Some are meant to slow you down, but others, such as running shoes, skateboards or jump pads, can be used to improve your speed. There are multiple paths for each level as well.",
