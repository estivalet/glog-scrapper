  "description": "With LA RUSSA BASEBALL '95, you not only get more than 700 Major League Baseball stars, you also get to the wisdom and experience of manager Tony La Russa. Considered to have one of the best baseball minds the game has ever seen, La Russa will offer his strategy and tips throughout the game, so you'll know exactly what he would do in a similar situation. There are three difficulty levels to choose from, and two different gameplay styles: Slugfest, which offers arcade-style action; and Sim, which puts every decision and every play in your hands. You can choose from 28 Major League teams, track your players' stats in all the major categories, and you can even choose whether you want to play or just manage your team. Step up to the plate and see if you can manage the game like La Russa does.",
