  "description": "Falchion is an ace pilot in the Space Defense Force, and the pilot of a space ship known as Divine. On his way back to his home planet, daydreaming about girls, Divine's computer picks up a transmission from a nearby planet. Answering the transmission, it turns out to be a distress call from a beautiful woman on the Water Planet. &quot;Save me...&quot; she pleads, &quot;and I will lend you my power.&quot; Falchion, lonely bachelor in space that he is, can't say no to a pretty face, and flies off towards the Water Planet.<br><br><i>Divine Sealing</i> is a basic vertically-scrolling shooter with adult content. The player controls the spaceship Divine, and shoots a variety of enemies. There are no bombs or powerups, but every 10,000 points the player is awarded with an extra life and a firepower upgrade. A boss appears at the end of each stage which must be destroyed. After defeating a boss, the player will meet up with one of four girls, who are then shown in various states of undress as Falchion &quot;borrows their power&quot;.",
