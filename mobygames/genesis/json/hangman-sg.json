  "description": "<i>Hangman SG</i> is a homebrew version of the popular Hangman game. Designed as a single-player game the player needs to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited amount of turns. There is a normal and a hard difficulty mode based on the word choice and a large dictionary is used. The game uses a limited amount of colours, a crudely drawn stickman and there is a cheery music track. The game was released on a cartridge with a limited print run of 100 copies and the title screen was personalized with the buyer's name.",
