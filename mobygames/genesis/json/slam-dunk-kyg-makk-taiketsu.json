  "description": "Hanamichi Sakuragi is your average high school delinquent; sporting a bright red pompadour and continually being shot down by every girl he approaches, he jumps at the chance to impress a cute girl named Haruko by joining his school's basketball team. While at first not knowing the difference between a <i>slam dunk</i> and a <i>Sherman tank</i>, he slowly becomes an important part of the Shohoku High School team, which fights against the odds on the road towards the regional championships.<br><br><i>Slam Dunk: Ky?g? Makk? Taiketsu!</i> (Champion Front Showdown!) is a five-on-five basketball game based on the anime and manga created by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,317342/\">Takehiko Inoue</a>. Following the story, starting from the first exhibition matches, the player can take control of either a single player or the whole Shohoku team in an arcade-style basketball game. The game uses a side-view for the center court, and zooms in for a head-on view when near the basket. There is also an exhibition mode for up to five players, where six different school teams from the series are available for play.",
