  "description": "This game is one of the eight text adventures that chronicles the lives of characters before their story continues in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/phantasy-star-ii\">Phantasy Star II</a>. This particular game covers Rudolf Steiner, a soldier of the Motavian government. One day, while preparing to head home from the military base he was stationed at, Rudolph sees a large amount of smoke appearing over his home town. Worried about his wife and child, Rudolph rushes off to his hometown to see what the problem is.<br><br>Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot. <br><br>Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP. ",
