  "description": "<i>Mad Stalker</i> is a side-scrolling mecha-themed brawler in which the player controls a character piloting a giant mecha (called &quot;Slave Gear&quot; in the game), fighting hostile robots unleashed upon the city by an evil mastermind. The player can choose between three playable characters: Chico Rodrigues, Richard Winston, and Eve Lurdia, each piloting their own version of a Slave Gear, distinguished by visual appearance as well as balancing of strength and speed. <br><br>The game consists of six linear stages in which the protagonist has to eliminate all enemies on screen before advancing, typically facing a boss enemy at the end of a stage. All the enemies in the game are mechas. Player-controlled robots fight with fists or swords (Winston's mecha); they can also jump, kick, as well as grab and throw opponents. The game also includes a single- or two-player versus fighting mode in which players can choose to control the protagonists or enemy mechas.",
