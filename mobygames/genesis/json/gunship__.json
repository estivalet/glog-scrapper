  "description": "<i>Gunship</i> is the Mega Drive version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=MicroProse\">MicroProse</a> helicopter series. Just like the original game the player gets to command a helicopter through a first-person perspective. Missions are preceded by a briefing and a planning stage. A map of the environment is shown from a top-down perspective with the starting position, enemy locations, fuel dumps, and the target. The player sets out custom waypoints to reach the target. Often a fuel refill is required to make it that far and it needs to be calculated in.<br><br>During missions the helicopter can be steered in any direction, but it is not necessary to keep track of waypoint directions, as they are automatically followed. The HUD contains the remaining distance, health, fuel, score, and a radar with enemies as red dots. There is a certain amount of freedom of movement and a voice warns about incoming missiles. Helicopters can be shot with a cannon. At a fuel dump the helicopter becomes vulnerable and the player can choose to disengage before the refueling is complete.<br><br>When the target is reached, an approach sequence is initiated. The game turns into a 2D 3rd-person side-scroller, unique to the series. There is freedom to move up and down and engage targets with the regular cannon or homing missiles in the air and on the ground. The helicopter can also turn 180 degrees to travel in the opposite direction. A yellow arrow marks the direction of the final target. In this sequence the player receives multiple lives (credits) to continue playing. In the first-person sequence death is final. These 2D sequences can be practiced as six scenario's in a simulator from the main menu.",
