  "description": "In the 13th century, the Catholic Church used it's soldiers to expel the members of the religious order of the Cathars from the Languedoc region of France. You, as Jean Raymond, have run from these soldiers and hidden in a Abbey. But it turns out the Abbey was built over catacombs of evil. Collect the twelve Cathar crosses to expel the evil from this building.<br><br><i>l'Abbaye des Morts</i> (Abbey  of the Dead) is a game designed to look and control like a ZX Spectrum game. It's gameplay is inspired by games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/manic-miner\">Manic Miner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/jet-set-willy\">Jet Set Willy</a>. You must move through room after room to find and gather the twelve crosses. Red hearts will grant you extra lives and stone pillars with a cross near the top act as checkpoints. Ring bells or move switches to open further passages. Avoid anything that is moving as it's touch will lose you a life. Lose all your lives and the game is over.",
