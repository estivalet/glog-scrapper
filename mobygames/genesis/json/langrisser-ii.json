  "description": "<i>Langrisser II</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/warsong\">Warsong</a> (whose original title is <i>Langrisser</i>). The events of the game take place several years after those described in <i>Warsong</i>. Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, which has made a pact with the malevolent Lord Böser, whose intention is to find the most powerful evil sword in the land, the Alhazard. The main hero of the game, the knight Elwin, must help the Descendants of Light to retrieve the legendary holy sword Langrisser, the only artifact that is more powerful than Alhazard.   <br><br>Like its predecessor, this is a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. The army is divided into soldier units and generals, who fight alone and who are usually stronger than a whole unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the battle, if you come into contact with an enemy unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.",
