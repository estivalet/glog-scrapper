  "description": "As the titular gymnast &quot;Trampoline Terror&quot;, it's up to the player to put a halt to the alien menace who has kidnapped the queen of the planet Ahas. To accomplish this task the player must diffuse bombs by walking over self-destruct switches while avoiding getting hit by enemies. The player can jump on tiles and trampolines in order to distance himself from any incoming enemies, although trampolines can only be jumped on a few times before they rip and become a hole that the player can fall down and die in. The player can also pick up a limited number of P-Balls in each stage and use them to eliminate enemies.",
