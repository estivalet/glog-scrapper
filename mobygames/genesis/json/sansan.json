  "description": "<i>Sansan</i> is a conversion of the popular board game Go, which allows the player to play online against distant opponents though the game's network service. It offers the ability to play against opponents who are not currently online, much like chess-by-mail, and also allows for sending short messages to the other player. Unlike most Meganet titles, it runs through Sansan's independently-run paid service, which has continued to be operational long after Sega's own service was discontinued.",
