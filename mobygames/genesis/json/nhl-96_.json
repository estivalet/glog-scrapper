  "description": "While the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/nhl-96\">PC version</a> migrated to 3D graphics, <i>NHL 96</i> on Genesis retains the classic 2D top-down view of the series, while offering different playing modes than the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=014633074925\">SNES version</a>.<br><br>The game features players and teams from the 1994-95 NHL season. Game modes include Regular Games, Shootouts, Playoffs (in either single elimination or best-of-seven mode), and a full season. Creating and trading players is also supported.<br><br>While the real NHL season was shortened due to a lockout, the game includes the originally planned 82-game schedule. In <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/nhl-95\">NHL 95</a>, any scheduled game could be played. This has been changed in favor of the player picking their team and taking it through the entire season. A scheduled game can either be played or simulated, and the season can be ended at any time, skipping to the playoffs based on current league standings.<br><br>Compared to previous entries, many more moves for players have been added, including give-and-gos, one-timers, the spin-o-rama, fake shots and drop passes. For the first time, the game has selectable difficulty levels, while fights between players make a return, having last been featured in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nhlpa-hockey-93\">NHLPA 93</a>.
