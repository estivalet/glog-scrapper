  "description": "An underground communist group vying for world domination has resurfaced after years in hiding. They have developed the experimental warfighter TU-190, which has enough firepower to threaten the entire free world, and it's headed for the United States. The UN sends in a lone fighter, Falcon, who must break through the enemy lines, destroy TU-190, and save the free world from destruction. Commence operation!<br><br><i>Task Force Harrier EX</i> is a vertically-scrolling shooter based on the 1989 arcade title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/task-force-harrier\">Task Force Harrier</a>; from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=UPL\">UPL</a>. The player controls the titular Harrier V fighter plane, which fires both air and ground volleys -- necessary to hit the targets that approach from both the air and the ground, like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xevious\">Xevious</a>. The player can collect various power-ups to increase their firepower, including smart bombs, weapon upgrades, and most notably a pair of invulnerable satellites which can change formation at command. There are three difficulty settings and a total of twelve stages to blast through.",
