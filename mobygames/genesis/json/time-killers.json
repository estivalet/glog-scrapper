  "description": "<i>Time Killers</i> is a one-on-one versus beat-em-up with gameplay in a similar vein as <a id=\"d1d8f602fa26edd81feb63b1751072c63\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Street+Fighter+2\">Street Fighter 2</a>. <br><br>What is primarily different is that you can attack with all body parts - the head, both arms and both legs. A damage system allows arms to be hacked off, but fighters can keep going with only legs and the head. A special feature allows the characters to perform a decapitation manoeuver called a 'death move' (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/death-sword\">Barbarian</a>), at any time during a round, instantly killing an opponent, and subsequently ending the round. The game features cartoon-like over-the-top blood and gore violence.<br><br>There are eight selectable characters, and each one has unique weapons and attributes pertaining to the period in time they are from, e.g. Thugg is a caveman with a stone axe from 20,000 BC, Musashi is a samurai from Feudal Japan 1496, Orion is an intergalactic bounty hunter with an electro-sword from 2885 etc.<br><br>In the single player game, if you manage to defeat all standard opponents, you can face off against Death himself.",
