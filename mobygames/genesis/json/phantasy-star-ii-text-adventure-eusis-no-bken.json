  "description": "This game is one of the eight text adventures that chronicles the lives of characters before their story continues in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/phantasy-star-ii\">Phantasy Star II</a>. This particular game covers Rolf Landale, a young orphan who is known around his town as an adept swordsman. After being challenged and defeated in a duel, Rolf leaves the orphanage and then spends the next 8 years training. When he comes back home, he finds out that one of the girls from the orphanage has been kidnapped, so now it's up to Rolf to go and rescue her.<br><br>Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot. <br><br>Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP. ",
