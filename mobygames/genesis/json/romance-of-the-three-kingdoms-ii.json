  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms\">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>. The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing' from <i>RTK I</i> (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). <i>RTK</i> can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The <i>RTK II</i> gameplay and interface is closely similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nobunagas-ambition-ii\">Nobunaga's Ambition II</a>.",
