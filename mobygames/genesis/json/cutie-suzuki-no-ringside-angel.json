  "description": "<i>Cutie Suzuki no Ringside Angel</i> is a wrestling game in which the player can choose to control any of the nine available female wrestlers. Each girl has her own strengths and weaknesses. There are three modes in the game: fighting against any of the opponents with the selected character; participating in a playoff tournament; and an additional &quot;watch&quot; mode that allows players to watch fights without participating. Beside the traditional moves, the wrestling style of the girls allows punching of their opponents.",
