  "description": "<i>X-Perts</i> is a spin-off of the <i>Eternal Champions</i> series. The game's plot is based on an alternate timeline, in which the assassin Shadow Yamoto, wasn't killed by the Black Orchid in 1993. She formed an anti-corruption group, the X-Perts, in revenge for an attempt on her life. Meanwhile, a group of terrorists took over an underwater research lab called AQUA, threatening to detonate a device that will destroy the entire Earth...<br><br>In this side-scrolling fighting action game, the player controls Shadow and two companions, switching between them. Each character can execute unique fighting moves, and possesses specific skills. The game is set entirely in the lab; the player uses a special RECOM screen to monitor the placement of characters across the separate areas of the lab, as well as all mission objectives, enemies, facility robots, and other hazards.<br><br>Beside fighting enemies, the player is also able to activate tasks for mission objectives. The time it takes to complete a task is based on the strength of the characters' engineering or computer science skills. Some secondary missions allow character upgrades to their personal weapons.<br><br>Characters can also use the so-called &quot;torture moves&quot;, unique for each character, to get information from the enemies instead of killing them. This would sometimes be needed for mission objectives. However, if not executed properly, it would instantly kill the enemy instead. <br><br>When the player leaves a character to activate another, he would still continue to perform his task until it was attacked by enemies, and would automatically defend itself, but to a lesser extent than if directly controlled by the player.<br><br>The game is broken down into chapters (save points). and each chapter remembers the status of the entire lab environment (enemies, flooded areas, broken power grids, hacked computers, and active force fields.)
