  "description": "This game is one of the eight text adventures that chronicles the lives of characters before their story continues in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/phantasy-star-ii\">Phantasy Star II</a>. This particular game covers Josh Kain, an aspiring although inept electrical engineer. His ineptness at repairing electronic devices, often destroying them in the process of trying to repair them, led him to become known as a &quot;wrecker&quot;.  A wrecker is someone  who can trash anything electronic. Josh Kain also ran away from his hometown when he was only 14, and now at 18 he lives by himself in an apartment in the town of Lume. He must survive on his own while dealing with a local gang, who are interested in using him for his talents as a wrecker.<br><br>Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot. <br><br>Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP. <br><br>\n",
