  "description": "NCAA Football lets you play as one of sixteen college football teams in either an exhibition game or in tournament play. The tournament pits you against all the other teams which you must win in order to proceed; the game will automatically save after each game won so you can pick up the tournament where you left off. Team rosters are unique in that you can choose players from different decades from the 60's up to the 90's, and you can mix players from different decades if you want.",
