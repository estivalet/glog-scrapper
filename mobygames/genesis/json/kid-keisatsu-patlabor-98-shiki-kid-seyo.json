  "description": "One of several games based on the <i>Mobile Police Patlabor</i> manga and anime franchise, <i>98-Shiki Kid? seyo!</i> (Launch, Type-98!) is an original scenario where the player takes the role of a new Division 2 recruit. Shortly after the player joins up, a silent military coup attacks their headquarters, and the new recruit must work together with the other Division 2 members to stop it.<br><br>The game is structured as a hybrid Japanese-style RPG/adventure game. The player moves and fights in a traditional RPG style, but entering certain locations switches the game to a command-adventure style where the player can ask characters about different subjects, investigate items of interest, and collect and use a wide variety of items. At first the player controls only the recruit, but other characters later join the player's party.",
