  "description": "The game situates itself on the &quot;Isla Sorna&quot; sites of Jurassic Park, a concept originally based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,9189/\">Steven Spielberg</a> series of movies. You play the role of a bounty hunter trying to catch some prized dinosaurs. This game is not a side scrolling platform game like the other two <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/jurassic-park-\">Jurassic Park</a> games on the Genesis. This is a top-down view game like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=SNS-J8-USA\">SNES version</a> of Jurassic Park, with gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/soldiers-of-fortune\">The Chaos Engine</a>.<br><br>Each of the four Isla Sorna sites contains three missions. Once you have completed the three missions you unlock the boss mission. For a change in the game, the boss missions are 3D look-alike levels. Once the four sites are cleared you get two more final missions to complete the game.",
