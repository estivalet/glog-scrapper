  "description": "Awogue is a superhero with the power to manipulate the wind using his cybernetic paper fans. The evil Hellbreeze has taken over the skies, and it's up to Awogue to stop him! To do this, he will need to utilize his full mastery of the air.<br><br><i>Awogue</i> is a scrolling action game where the player controls the titular hero as he flies and floats around each stage. He must collect three flashing &quot;gate keys&quot; in order to open the warp gate on each stage, while fending off enemies and avoiding various hazards. Awogue can move freely using his fans, which will propel him in various directions and fire a burst of air in the opposing direction; this burst of air is his basic attack, and can push enemies around. He can also do a rushing attack, as well as a special move called the &quot;Rolling Awogue&quot; which will deal a lot of damage to nearby enemies, but will also deplete Awogue's power.",
