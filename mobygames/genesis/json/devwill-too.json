  "description": "<i>Devwill Too</i> is a homebrew Genesis 2D platformer. It is the follow-up to the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/devwill\">Devwill</a>, but not really a sequel.<br><br>The player controls a small, red fantasy creature called Homunculus. Levels consist of several single screen environment strung together horizontally using the flip screen mechanic. There are several precise platform mechanics such as getting past gaps, spikes and leaving crumbling surfaces in time. Next to general movement the character can jump, a move also used to take out enemies. This can also be done by sliding into them. Quickly taking out enemies in succession is encouraged through a combo mechanic of up to nine hits. This is rewarded with points and an additional life is provided for every 400 points.<br><br>The game consists of eighteen stages, including two hidden ones. Levels are not entirely linear, with multiple vertical routes and backtracking by returning to the left side of the screen. There are thirteen animated sequences and five bosses to defeat. The game keeps track of the highscore and there is a Jukebox option in the main menu to listen to the game's soundtrack with fifteen tracks.",
