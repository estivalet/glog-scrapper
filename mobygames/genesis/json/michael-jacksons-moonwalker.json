Mr. Big has kidnapped children and has nasty things in store for them, like drugging them and making them slaves. So it's up to Michael to use his magical powers and dancing talent to try to catch Mr. Big and rescue his little friends.<br><br>Michael Jackson can jump, throw magical stars, and dance to counter his opponents as he looks for the hidden children. Stages come in various shapes and sizes from some of Jackson's hit videos which take place in streets and graveyards. ",
