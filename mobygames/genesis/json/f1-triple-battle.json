  "description": "<i>Fastest 1</i> is a Formula One racing game. The game doesn't have an official FIA license, but much like Human's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Fire+Pro+Wrestling+series\">Fire Pro Wrestling series</a>, includes a number of recognizable fictionalized drivers, such as Ayrton Sesna and Satoru Inakajima. The game includes a world championship mode, where the player must start from the lowest rankings and win races to become the F1 world champion. There is also a battle mode where one or two players can race each other or against computer opponents, as well as a test run mode where the player can learn each course and try to set course records. There are a total of 16 different courses, which can be played in either dry, wet, or half-wet conditions, as well as a wide variety of vehicle settings that can be tweaked.",
