  "description": "<i>SupraKillminds</i> is a fast-paced puzzle title based on the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Quartet\">Quartet</a>. The goal of the game is to assemble gems by fitting four pieces together. A piece with one of four available colours appears in the middle of the screen. The player has to sent it to one of the four quadrants using the four directions on the D-pad. Based on the form it automatically moves to the correct part of the quadrant. When a complete quadrant is formed, points are scored and the pieces disappear. More points are provided for creating gems completely of the same color, but this is not required. Even if all parts have a different color points are still awarded. When a gem is made and all quadrants are then empty, the largest amount of points is awarded (500) as well as an extra life.<br><br>At the start of the game five lives are provided. A life is lost when a piece is accidentally sent to an occupied space or when time runs out before a move is made. Only a small amount of time is available to decide. For every 1,000 points the available time per move is decreased. It starts with two seconds per move.<br><br>The game was released on two types of cartridges as a mail order release, but also as a free download.",
