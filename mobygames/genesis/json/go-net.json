  "description": "<i>Go Net</i> is a conversion of the popular board game Go, which allows the player to play online against distant opponents through the game's network service. Unlike most Meganet titles, it ran through Ai-System's independently-run paid service, which continued to be operational well after Sega's own Meganet service was discontinued. Though the service still exists, support for this specific version has long since ended. In addition to playing the game itself, players could also send short messages to each other (in hiragana), or view a dedicated message board for the service.",
