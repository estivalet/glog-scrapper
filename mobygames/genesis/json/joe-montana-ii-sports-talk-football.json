  "description": "Sports Talk Football is Sega's second football game on the Genesis, again licensed from San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana.<br><br>As indicated by the title, the game's main innovation is play-by-play commentary speech unique to what is happening on the field.<br><br>Playing options include exhibition games and a league mode. The game features 28 teams and a playbook of more than 50 plays. Players can also create a &quot;dream team&quot; from all the players in the game and save it through a password.<br><br>The action is seen in a horizontal view of the field, which switches to a zoomed-in view once the line of scrimmage is crossed. Two players can play either against each other or cooperatively on the same team.",
