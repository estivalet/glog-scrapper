  "description": "A follow-up to the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rolling-thunder\">Rolling Thunder</a>, this is a &quot;shoot-the-bad-guys-and-save-the-world&quot; game. A terrorist group has taken out the world information flow and, as either a guy named Albert Ross or a woman named Leila, you must stop them. You can also get weapons that pack more of a punch than your ordinary hand gun. The original Arcade version  of <i>Rolling Thunder 2</i> supports two-player cooperative play. <br><br>The Genesis conversion is single-player only, but instead it introduces several new stages with new enemies and bosses. The original stages have been tweaked to provide more cover points and bonus items; also two new weapons were added - a laser and a flamethrower. The storyline cutscenes between the stages were expanded. This version introduces a password system that allows the players to continue from any previously visited stage.",
