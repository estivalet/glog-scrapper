  "description": "As with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-pirates\">the original</a>, this is a blend of strategy, action and adventure. <i>Pirates! Gold</i> lets you play the role of a beginning buccaneer in the 17th century Spanish Main, in search of fame and fortune. Each town in this untamed raw region has different surprises and dangers. <br><br>How you acquire stature is up to you; you can make your living through honest trade and the search for hidden treasure, or you can be a little more daring and attack and plunder ships. As you can choose a specific skill to stand out in, the game can vary each time. Sword fighting is played out in side-view action sequences.",
