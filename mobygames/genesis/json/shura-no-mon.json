He walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a karate gi he comes across...<br><br><i>Shura no Mon</i> is a so-called &quot;command action&quot; game based on the manga by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Masatoshi+Kawahara\">Masatoshi Kawahara</a>. The player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from a list, using different attacks and defensive maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the results shown via brief animated sequences. Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes progress the story. The plot closely follows the first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.",
