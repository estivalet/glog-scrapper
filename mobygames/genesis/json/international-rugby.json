  "description": "<i>International Rugby</i> is a rugby game played from a top-down perspective. The game consists of tournament matches played as part of the world cup with countries such as England, USA, Argentina, France, Wales, Scotland, Fiji etc. In the options the type of tournament can be determined, along with the amount of wind and match length. Multiplayer is supported for two players.<br><br>At the kick off, during a scrimmage and whenever the ball goes over a side line, a meter appears to determine the power and curve. It is filled up automatically and the player has to press a button twice to time both aspects. While running with the ball, it can be passed along or kicked. In a defensive position it is possible to tackle and switch between players. Each player has individual statistics based on position, height, weight, speed, passing, rucking, tackling, tactics, kicking and injury. Fixtures for the world cup can be looked up on a separate screen.",
