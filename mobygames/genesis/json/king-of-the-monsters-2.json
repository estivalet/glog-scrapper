  "description": "<i>King of the Monsters 2</i> on the Sega Genesis is a slightly different game than the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/neo-geo/king-of-the-monsters-2-the-next-thing\">Neo Geo version</a>. While the original let you play one of three different monsters to go through side-scrolling beat'em-up stages and fight (non-playable) monster as boss enemies, the Genesis version was re-worked into a one-on-one fighter similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/king-of-the-monsters\">first King of the Monsters game</a>. <br><br>Apart from Farmardy, all characters from the Neo Geo version are playable. To win, the player must defeat all other monsters and a clone of the played monster in a fight. The matches take place in areas built from the original levels, and feature destroyable landscapes and secondary enemies, both of which can be smashed to gain points and power-ups.",
