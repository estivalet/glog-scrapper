  "description": "<i>Populous II</i> continues the &quot;god game&quot; genre pioneered by Bullfrog's classic <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Populous\">Populous</a></i>.  In PII, you're an unproven immortal who must fight your way through an entire pantheon of Greek gods, each with his or her own strategy and attacks, and ultimately enter into a showdown with Zeus himself.<br><br>The gameplay mechanics are similar to <i>Populous</i>, but PII features a wider array of spells, digitized sound, and high-resolution graphics to give the spell effects extra punch.  Multiplayer is supported via serial link and dial-up.",
