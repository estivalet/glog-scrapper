  "description": "Young prince Muu is the son of the king of the country Pasfelda. One day, during a major ceremony, the kingdom is attacked by an army of monsters. The royal wizard has no choice but to use cursed magic. As a result, the mighty demon Rufid appears and challenges the prince to battle. Defeated by the demon, the prince is saved by a mysterious force, and is teleported out of the town, to a remote village, where his adventure truly begins.<br><br><i>Surging Aura</i> is Japanese RPG in anime style. Regular enemies are random, and battles are fought from first-person view. The combat is is a mixture between turn-based and real-time styles, like in contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Final+Fantasy\"> Final Fantasy</a> games. Enemies will attack even if the player doesn't perform any action during the battle. The game features full screen anime-style pictures as cutscenes.",
