  "description": "<i>Wolverine: Adamantium Rage</i> sends fan favorite Marvel mutant Wolverine out to explore his past in a beat'em up/platformer, similar to, but different from the version released on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/wolverine-adamantium-rage\">SNES</a>.<br><br>The game begins in the Weapon X lab, and continues through the icy landscape of Dead Man's Land, the Canadian forests and a hallucinatory lunar scenery. In New York, Wolverine must make his way through the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, an underground dungeon, and the NYC sewers for a final showdown. Lots of enemies stand in his way: flying robot drones, armed guards, The Hand ninjas and Inner Circle bodyguards, among others. He can take them out with basic jumps, kicks and slashes, as well as link the basic moves into more powerful combos. When Wolverine takes damage, his mutant healing factor kicks in, (slowly) regenerating his health. Health packs should be sought out, however, because just sitting around waiting for the health to recharge is not an option: a timer slowly ticks down to the appearance of the android girl Elsie Dee, designed to destroy Wolverine. Her embrace means instant death.<br><br>Besides the basic enemies, many levels also includes a number of boss fights, some against faceless hardware like a giant robot or a helicopter, others against Wolverine's signature foes. These include classics like Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike as well as many culled from early 1990s X-Men comics like Albert (an android replica of Wolverine), Cyber, Trevor Fitzroy and Shinobi Shaw. Information about all of the characters can be accessed from an in-game menu.",
