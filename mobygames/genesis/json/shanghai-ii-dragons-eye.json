Players try to remove mahjong tiles in pairs from a set pattern.  Different versions of the game have up to eight different tile sets, twelve patterns based on the animals of the Chinese zodiac, and a layout editor for creating patterns.<br><br>In addition to the standard mode, the game also features &quot;Dragon's Eye&quot;, a two-player Shanghai variant.  Players take turns adding and removing tiles from a small field with one player attempting to remove all the tiles and the other trying to position tiles to make this impossible.",
