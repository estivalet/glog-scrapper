  "description": "<i>Bomb on Basic City</i> is a homebrew Genesis game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bomb+on+Pixel+City\">Bomb on Pixel City</a> titles. In ten zones the player controls a plane using a 2D side view and needs to bomb the buildings below. The background scrolls and wraps around, but the same applies to the plane when it reaches the right side of the screen and at a faster speed. With each pass the plane can only drop one bomb so it needs to be timed carefully to target a specific building or one of the enemies below firing at the plane. With every pass the plane also flies four pixels lower, providing less room to time the bomb and avoid enemy fire.<br><br>The speed of the plane can be influenced by accelerating or braking, but it cannot be stopped entirely. Hits are rewarded with points, but also with bonuses that float upwards. They include a move bonus that allows the plane to fly up and down, the ability to launch three bombs at once and a buckler bonus that protects the plane against AA fire. A POW bonus is provided for every score and combo. When the POW meter is full a super bomb can be dropped.<br><br>The game fits the developer <i>Papi</i> series of games so here the character controlling the game is Papi Commando. The <i>Bomb on Pixel City</i> games it draws its inspiration from reference the pixels of systems such as the Atari 2600. In this game this is changed as a humorous take on programming languages as Papi Commando needs to prevent Basic City (named after the Basic language) against the C++ invading force.",
