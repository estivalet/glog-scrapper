  "description": "The Madden football series appears for the last time on the Genesis with <i>Madden NFL 98</i>. With <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/madden-nfl-98\">PC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/madden-nfl-98_\">next-gen</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/madden-football-64\">console</a> versions having moved to 3D graphics, the Genesis version retains the classic view of the series. Most of the playing modes are the same as on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/madden-nfl-98___\">SNES</a>, but the Genesis version has its own selection of teams and gameplay options.<br><br>Players can select from the 30 teams of the 1997 NFL season, the 1997 All-Madden team, an EA Sports and a THQ team, plus 68 classic NFL teams, from the 1950s to the 1990s. Playing modes include exhibition games (now optionally as a best-of-three or best-of-five series), seasons and playoffs. There is also an option to replay all Super Bowls since 1988. The game tracks records in 13 categories. A new feature are hot and cold streaks for teams, in which their recent playing history influences their current stats. Player creation and trading returns from the predecessors. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/madden-nfl-97_\">Madden 97</a> (but unlike in the SNES version), player stats are set from a point pool. There are options for salary caps and trading deadlines in seasons and playoffs, and it is always possible to play with the regular instead of the modified rosters. During a game, it is again possible to control any player on the field by toggling Any Player Mode (a feature not available on the SNES).<br><br>",
