  "description": "<i>World Trophy Soccer</i> (also known as <i>European Club Soccer</i>) is a reworking of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/microleague-action-sports-soccer\">Manchester United Europe</a>, using the same side-view gameplay and a wider view than Krisalis' other football game of the time, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=John+Barnes\">John Barnes' European Football</a>.<br><br>All the teams who were in contention for one of the 3 main European tournaments as they were at the time of the game's release are included, although with fictitious player names and a few inaccurate kits. Cutscenes detail the match's progress, while a referee is active on the screen. The game can be played in arcade or simulation modes, with 6 different formations available.",
