  "description": "<i>Frog Feast</i> is a 16-bit version of the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/frog-bog\">Frog Bog</a> game featuring improved graphics, sound, AI, and more. The game made its launch at both the Classic Gaming Expo 2005 and VGXPO, Dallas events on the same day.<br><br>The gameplay itself is quite simple and easy to figure out. In the single player version your goal is to catch as many flies floating about the top of the screen within the time allowed and to beat the AI's frogs score. In the 2-player version, you do the same but go head-2-head against another player which makes snagging those flies at the last minute, just before your competitor does, a real treat.",
