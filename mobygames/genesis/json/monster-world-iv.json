  "description": "<i>Monster World IV</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wonder-boy-in-monster-world\">Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3</a>. The player controls Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling action platformer with light RPG elements (treasure, equipment, etc.). Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the &quot;down&quot; button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is quite similar to that of early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Zelda\">Zelda</a> games. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts; as the story advances, their amount increases. ",
