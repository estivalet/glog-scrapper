  "description": "In <i>Traysia</i>  the player controls a young man named Roy, who lives in the town Johanna. All his life Roy has been dreaming about leaving the town and going to explore faraway lands. Now, finally, his chance has come. His uncle, a travelling merchant, is going on a journey, and Roy decides to leave with him. His girlfriend Traysia gives him a pendant, to remind him of her... will Roy be able to escape from all the dangers that await him on his long journey and to see Traysia again?<br><br>The game is a party-based RPG with randomly encountered enemies. The combat is somewhat similar to early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ultima\"> Ultima</a> games. When an enemy appears, the player is presented with a battle screen on which the party is positioned in the lower part, the enemies in the upper part. Characters can attack if they are close enough to the enemy, otherwise they have to move towards them. Magic spells should be cast in an appropriate direction to hurt the enemy. ",
