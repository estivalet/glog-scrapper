  "description": "The Sno-Bees are back! One day in Antarctica, an asteroid crashes into the crystal that protects the penguins, shattering it into many pieces and freeing the Sno-Bees who had been frozen in ice. In order to rescue his people, the blue penguin (along with a pink penguin in two-player mode) goes after the Sno-Bees and to recover the missing pieces of the crystal. The game takes the basic template of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pengo\">1982 original</a> and expands on it, offering a greater variety of enemies, various environmental hazards, and power-ups, along with of course updated 16-bit graphics and sound. The goal is still to push blocks and crush enemies. Enemies now appear from generators, which must be destroyed to stop new enemies from appearing, and all enemies must then be eliminated to complete each stage.<br><br>In addition to the main story mode, the game also features a competitive battle mode for up to four players, as well as a conversion of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pengo\">original arcade game</a>.",
