  "description": "Before the time of plants and animals, Earth was completely dark and inhabited by beings we now call 'monsters'. When some voice said 'Let There Be Light' , many monsters died because they could not live in this new light world. Not all died however; some of them hid in caves, and grew stronger. Now, they want to return to the world.<br><br>Corona is a boy from Soleil Town who just turned fourteen and has to undergo a series of trials to become a true swordsman. However, soon he finds himself in a strange predicament: unable to speak to humans any more, he learns to communicate with animals, and realizes that not everything in the world is as simple as it looks.<br><br><i>Crusader of Centy</i> is an overhead action game with light role-playing and puzzle-solving elements, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Zelda\">Zelda</a> games. The game's stand-out feature are animal companions. various animals are met by Corona during the course of the game, and can be &quot;equipped&quot; to grant him new abilities: for example, a penguin will add an ice attack property to his sword, etc.",
