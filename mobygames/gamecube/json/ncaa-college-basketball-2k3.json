  "description": "Play as one of over 300 college hoops teams in this first college outing for the 2k lineup.  Take control of a full coaching career from inception at a small time college working your way up to a major powerhouse performer.  You can also play a skirmish with a friend, go out for a two-on-two game, or one of many other play modes you would expect in a competitive basketball game.  Just don't play it like the NBA... the college game has a different, more team-oriented feel, and this comes through in the gameplay.  ",
