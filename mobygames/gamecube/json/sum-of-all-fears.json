  "description": "<i>The Sum of all Fears</i> is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Rogue+Spear\">Rogue Spear series</a>. It's from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear. <br><br>The game's story is build around the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Tom+Clancy\">Tom Clancy</a> book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.<br><br>Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.",
