  "description": "<i>Disney Sports Soccer</i> is the first game in the series of Konami/Disney collaborations that put Disney characters into sports simulations. The Soccer entry is based on Konami's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Winning+Eleven\">Winning Eleven</a>/<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=International+Superstar+Soccer\">ISS</a> series, offering a similarly complex simulation of the sport crossed with more arcade-like features.<br><br>The game features eight different teams, each captained by characters like Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. Three game modes are included: exhibition games (for up to four players), Dream Cup and Challenge Cup. The Dream Cup is a knockout tournament, while the Challenge Cup asks players to take on all other teams in the game successively. The game features the setting of formations and strategies and upgrading player's abilities.<br><br>The controls allow for a variety of moves during a match, including shot curves, one-two passes, keeper charges, volleys, and much more. Arcade elements come into play with magic abilities. These are unlocked through winning Cup matches and allow the team captains to use powers such as extra-powerful kicks that are guaranteed to hit the goal or can incapacitate other players, short time invincibility, and many more.",
