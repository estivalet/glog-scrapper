  "description": "<i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> is an action-adventure game that follows the story of the fourth movie and book of the same name. In addition to the usual challenges and dangers that Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to face, the Triwizard Tournament will be held at Hogwarts and mysteriously Harry is in the tournament!<br><br>One to three players control Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the computer controls the remaining characters for one and two-player games). Played with a third-person view, you will need to complete numerous game levels which feature a variety of action and puzzle-solving as well as completing the three tasks in the Triwizard Tournament and facing Lord Voldemort. Each character has magic spells that can be used to help out, and additional spells can be learned as you make your way through the game. Occasionally all three characters will need to work together to complete a task, such as moving a particularly large object or defeating a tough opponent. During the game you will come across Bertie Bott's Every-Flavor Beans; collecting these can help out by restoring stamina or magic powers. Additionally, at the end of each level, the Beans can be used to purchase collector cards; these are used to increase a character's abilities. ",
