  "description": "<i>Digimon World 4</i> is the second <i>Digimon</i> game for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. Instead of a standard RPG like the previous games, it has action RPG gameplay with hack-and-slash and supports up to four players. It also contains elements of digital pet games where creatures can be trained to level up. It is loosely based on the events in the <i>Digital Monster X-Evolution</i> animated film. You can choose between Dorumon, Veemon, Guilmon, and Agumon as the playable characters. They are members of the Digital Security Guard and their mission is to save the DigiWorld from a computer virus, called X-virus, that invaded their world.<br><br>The Digimon can go through a digivolution based on a number of parameters. Magic skills are upgraded through training. There are several types of magic and each one has its own elements, type, and level. There are three difficulty levels: medium, hard, and very hard.",
