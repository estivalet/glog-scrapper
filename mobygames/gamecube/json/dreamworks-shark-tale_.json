Oscar seems to have got himself into a bit of trouble as he needs to earn money to pay off a loan shark.<br><br>The game consists of over 25 chapters with each chapter having three missions to perform. The three missions are broken into a regular one, a bonus one, and an elite one. Completing missions earn Oscar fame points which affect his fame rating.
