  "description": "<i>The Great Juju Challenge</i> is the third game in the platforming series. It stars Tak (the hero from the first two games) and his brother Lok. The story is about how the people in Tak's village have set up a course of events for people to compete in. The game is a mixture of platforming and adventure. Tak and Lok have entered the event in hopes of winning. Introduced to this game is the ability to swap between characters with the touch of a butto or in 2 player mode you can play together in split screen. \nThe characters have to reach various checkpoints to extend the level. All the levels take place in the various jungle settings of Tak's Village. The events consist of swimming, racing, climbing ropes, and other endurance challenges.<br><br>Tak is the magic user while Lok is the brawn. During the game, the two characters provide comical banter with each other. Tak can use a chicken suit to fly and a lobster suit to swim underwater. The cutscenes are in real time. Taloc, the bad guy from the previous games, is nowhere to be found as the game now focuses on the Juju challenge and not on trying to defeat the bad guy. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Patrick+Warburton\">Patrick Warburton</a> voices Lok.",
