  "description": "Based on the movie of the same name.  You play John Anderton, the head of Pre-Crime.  The game is a third person fighting/adventure game.  You fight your way through Pre-crime cops and change your identity in an attempt to clear your name of pre-murder charges.<br><br>The game involves both hand-to-hand combat, the use of weapons and flying a jet pack. When fighting an opponent hand-to-hand there are multiple punch and kick combinations that can be used, these have greater effect on the opponent rendering them senseless quicker. Unconscious opponents can be picked up and then either hit some more or thrown. <br><br>Around the levels there are power-ups to collect such as health and cash, the health is used immediately to restore the player's character while the cash is used on the black market, accessed via the pause menu, to purchase new combat manoeuvres; permanent upgrades; temporary upgrades or weapons.\n",
