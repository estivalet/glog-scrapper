  "description": "<i>Harvest Moon: Magical Melody</i> returns to the concept of the original <i>Harvest Moon</i> game, excluding much of the newer features brought into later titles. <br><br>Returning to the game are full 30 day seasons, festivals, and the top-down look of the originals. Also a first for the <i>Harvest Moon series</i>, play as either a male or a female (note: there is only a male character in the European/PAL version!) and choose from numerous spouses to marry. Other new features include buying land, placing furniture in the player's house, and numerous other things. Multiplayer mini-games are also available to unlock, to play with friends and family.<br><br>Another feature is the rival system, where an opponent also tries to save the Harvest Goddess, win prizes in festivals, and be the one who ships most items on a daily basis. In the English version, the player may eventually even marry their rival, but this ends the game. Next to finding a spouse, the second major quest is saving the goddess. To do so, the player needs to reach goals to gather musical notes, to form the titular magic melody.",
