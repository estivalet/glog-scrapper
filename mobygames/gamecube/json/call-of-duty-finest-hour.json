  "description": "<i>Call of Duty: Finest Hour</i> is the first CoD game on the consoles. \nThe story spans through three different fronts in the Second World War through three soldiers' viewpoints. \nBasically, the game is a heavily scripted, story-driven action game where the main focus is on the action and the dramatization of the war and the people in the middle of it all. One of the defining features if Call of Duty-games is the mood they set and the accurate reproduction of the actual WW2 battlefields and operations. As well as the usual range of WW2 weaponry, in CoD:FH there are also vehicles in which one can drive around, blasting the enemies to bits in the process.",
