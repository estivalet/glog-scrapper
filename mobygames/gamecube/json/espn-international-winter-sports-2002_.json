The gameplay for each event varies, but feature similar controls that require the player to tap a set of buttons when prompted for control, speed, etc.  Depending on if the player hits the required buttons successfully and the timing will determine the outcome of these events.<br><br>There are four different gameplay modes that include <i>Championship</i> which lets the player compete in a series of events to win the coveted gold medal and <i>Head-to-Head</i> which allows two players to compete against each other.  It also features the ESPN license which adds to the realism with a TV-style presentation along with announcers for in-game commentary.",
