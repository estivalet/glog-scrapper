  "description": "This game is based on the Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence buddy cop movie sequel Bad Boys II.  You can play as either character, Mike, or Marcus, from 1st or 3rd person viewpoints. Each has their own personalities and characteristics. <br><br>Through 15 stages, you engage in fast-paced all-action gameplay that features multiple mission objectives. Shoot your way through Colombian drug lords, Russian mobsters, and even dirty cops. Sometimes you will need to protect your computer-controlled partner or collect some evidence.  You can often duck behind a wall or around a corner, from where you will be able to pick off your targets with less chance of being hit. You will be accordingly rewarded on your successful actions and achievements on a &quot;Bad Boy&quot; rating system. You can follow all the laws and avoid unnecessary damage or take the opposite approach and be a Bad Boy. There's a good amount of different weapons from pistols and shotguns to automatic assault rifles and grenades. Environments are fully destructible. You can use a quick aiming and shooting Action mode, or search for clues and evidence using the Explore mode.",
