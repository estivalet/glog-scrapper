  "description": "<i>Dead to Rights</i> is a 3rd-person shooter in which the player is Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City. On a routine call, he finds the dead body of his father. While trying to find the murderer, he is framed for another murder. Jack becomes a fugitive; his run from the law will take him to various places, from strip joints and hotels to office complexes, and even prison, as an inmate.<br><br>When controlling Jack, players can perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, or tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. If Jack does not have a gun drawn, he can disarm an enemy which causes him to steal the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finish, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as the game progresses.<br><br>Players will sometimes have to control Jack's best friend and partner, his K-9 dog Shadow, which allows enemies to be killed from a distance. In addition, Shadow will fetch their guns and bring them to Jack.<br><br>The game also features &quot;adrenaline combat&quot;, similar to &quot;Bullet Time&quot; from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/max-payne\">Max Payne</a>. Jack will then perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving him an advantage, as long as his adrenaline meter holds out.",
