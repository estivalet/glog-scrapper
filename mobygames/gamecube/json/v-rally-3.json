  "description": "The rally racing series is back, with more drivers, cars and tracks than in the preceding games.<br><br>Players can choose from a variety of game modes including rally racing in V-Rally Mode, time runs in Time Attack mode or time limited challenge runs in Challenge Mode, the last two also being available for up two four players taking turns in multiplayer mode. But the main goal is to defeat every racer on the rally circuit and become champion. The better players are and the further they get the more cars and tracks can be unlocked. In all, there are 80 drivers (six being actual rally drivers), 48 tracks (across six countries), and 20 cars for players to beat and unlock. There are two titles to earn - the 1.6 liter 2WD championship, and the 2 liter 4WD championship.<br><br>Players can view the race from inside the car or behind it as they scream through snow, rain, fog, dirt, gravel and over jumps at different times of day and night as they try to become the best rally racer on the planet.",
