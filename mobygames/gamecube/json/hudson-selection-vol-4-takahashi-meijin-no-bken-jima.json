  "description": "A budget remake of the side-scrolling platform game Adventure Island for the GameCube and PlayStation 2.\nThe story starts out with Master Higgins and his girlfriend relaxing until a purple cloud takes his girlfriend away to King Quiller. So it's up to Master Higgins to go and rescue her.\nThis remake is different from the original in that the graphics were rendered to 3D, the music was completely overhauled, the bosses do more things than throw their weapons at Master Higgins, and this remake contains bonus materials.",
