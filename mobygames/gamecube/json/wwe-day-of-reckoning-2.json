  "description": "In this sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wwe-day-of-reckoning\">WWE Day of Reckoning</a> there are 45 wrestlers to choose from. The game has a new and longer story mode, as well as continuations of the storylines from the first game. The player can also create his own wrestlers and put them in the story mode. The wrestlers Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan join the roster as Legends.<br><br>The fighting system has been enhanced. Basic gameplay revolves around stamina rather than just a general energy level. If all stamina is gone, the player won't be able to control the wrestler. In addition, players can perform up to four unique submission moves. The game displays injuries sustained by the wrestlers, ranging from a small cut on the forehead to a face or a chest covered by blood, which may also drip onto the mat and stay there. A new type of match called The Last Man Standing is included in the game. In this match type the wrestlers are counted out while stunned. The Create-A-Wrestler feature has returned for this game and is used for story mode.",
