  "description": "Dora and her trusty monkey companion Boots are star gazing when much to their surprise a space ship lands near them. Aliens from the purple planet hop out to say hello but at that very moment the ship falls apart - Dora takes it upon herself to help the aliens return home by collecting enough gems to power their spaceship for a return flight.<br><br>The player controls Dora while she searches for gems throughout the game. The gem collecting is broken up by basic button timing puzzles and interruptions from Swiper. After collecting enough gems the player blasts off into space to collect gems in a space minigame followed more planets and levels. The voice acting for Dora is done by the original voice actress Kathleen Herles.",
