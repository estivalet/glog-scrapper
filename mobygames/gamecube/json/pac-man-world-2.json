  "description": "Long ago, an evil stronger then anything before or after it, was trapped underneath a tree, which grew the five golden fruits. Years later the band of ghosts, who continue to roam Pac-World, have stolen the fruits from the tree. Unknown to them, they have also unleashed the evil that lurked beneath the tree on a helpless Pac-World. Only one Pac can return the five golden fruits to the tree and stop both the ghosts and the new evil from destroying Pac-World, and that's Pac-Man.<br><br>Using his famous munching skills, Pac-Man must explore 20 monster, pit and trap filled levels. But of course, the Pac-Pills can be found across each map to aid Pac-Man in his quest.<br><br>The game also features four classic <i>Pac-Man</i> games to unlock, all taken from different Namco compilations.
