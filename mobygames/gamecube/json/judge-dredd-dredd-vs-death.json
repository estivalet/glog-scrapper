  "description": "Judge Dredd is back. The comic book character who acts as judge, jury, and executioner makes another video game appearance in a first-person shooter set in the 22nd century, where crime and hopelessness run rampant amidst the chaos left behind from a nuclear holocaust.<br><br>Players must enforce the law using any means necessary within the sprawling, overpopulated Mega-City One, which serves as the gritty backdrop for <i>Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death</i>. Players will battle vampires, the undead, and even a cadre of Dark Judges as they try to maintain some semblance of order in a world gone wild. In keeping with the spirit of the comic, some perpetrators of lesser crimes need to be arrested while others must be taken out with extreme prejudice. <br><br>The ultimate goal is to confront the evil Judge Death, who has taken it upon himself to cause as much mayhem and destruction to the beleaguered city as possible.
