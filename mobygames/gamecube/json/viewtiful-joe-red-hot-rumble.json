  "description": "This game is different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Viewtiful+Joe+series\">previous incarnations</a>, whereas this one takes its gameplay from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Super+Smash+Brothers+series\">Super Smash Bros. series</a>.  The game features the main heroes, Joe, Capt. Blue and Silvia, along with many others as well as a group of villains fighting each other in a series of battles in multiple environments, such as a construction site, a warehouse and a wrestling ring to name a few.<br><br>The story has Captain Blue getting ready to shoot a new movie, but has trouble deciding who will be the lead character, so he sets up a tournament of the heroes to determine it.   The player takes control of one of the three heroes, battling a set of enemies, each stage having their own set objectives to complete in order to advance.  There is also a party mode that can support up to four-different players in an all out brawl.  Players can collect &quot;VFX Orbs&quot; throughout the fight, collecting enough will allow the player to use a VFX power on the opponent(s).<br><br>The PSP port is virtually the same same, but with added content exclusive to it, a single player <b>Trial Mode</b>, where the player competes in a series of mini-games, the ability to play as Dante from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Devil+May+Cry+series\">Devil May Cry series</a> and a game sharing feature that lets players play wirelessly using Ad-Hoc and play certain stages using only one disc.",
