  "description": "<i>Curious George</i> is a platformer based on the animated movie of the same name. Ted Shackleford, a human with a big yellow hat, visits Africa in search of an idol. This project does not work out, but he finds a new friend: the monkey Curious George. The game follows their way back to America and shows scenes from the movie as cutscenes.<br><br>During the thirteen linear levels, the player takes control over George. The majority of time is spent with platform challenges which usually involve jumping or swinging over gaps. Frequently the levels are interrupted by mini-games, Those involve simple tasks, for example, rhythm sequences (pressing given buttons with the correct timing) or arcade sequences. Optionally the player can collect bananas on the way and receive special points by interacting with certain objects. Those are used to unlock bonus content: the cutscenes and mini-games already experienced during regular play as well as a few hats for George to wear.",
