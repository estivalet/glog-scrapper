  "description": "This new Mario Party has a twist. Along with the four-player party action that is expected with the board game like series, a new addition to the Mario Party team is the microphone. New mini-games included are now voice-activated, and using the microphone, you can command characters and play games like never before.<br><br>Brighton (the sun) and Twila (the moon) constantly argue with each other over who is better. The debate creates a change in conditions during play, where it may be daytime at one point but suddenly change to nighttime. Depending on the time of day, mini-games will change, other characters will appear, and the board will modify in shape.<br><br>The same four-player action is on-board with a ton of new and updated mini-games to play either during the party or by itself when unlocked. You can also play solo with the computer filling in the gaps. Along with collecting stars, there are also other objectives depending on the game board you choose, from which there are six varying types to choose.",
