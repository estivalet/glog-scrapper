  "description": "Experience the world of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=C%2eS+Lewis\">C.S Lewis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,199902/\">Andrew Adamson's</a> book and film. Play as Susan, Edmund, Lucy and Peter from the film, and journey through the Professor's house, the forests of Narnia, and escape the attack on London during World War II.  <br><br>Depending on which level you're playing, you'll be able to play as at least two of the four children, although some levels require you to use all four. The four children all have different special abilities. Peter is the strongest of the bunch, so you can use him for fighting off enemies or breaking through barriers. Susan is a ranged fighter and she can throw arrows, tennis balls, and snowballs. Edmund is a decent melee fighter who can climb trees and walk on ice without breaking it. Lucy has the ability to heal the other children, go through small spaces and stand on big snowballs, and make them roll. During each level, you can switch between characters at any time.<br><br>Scattered throughout the levels are coins, pink and green gems, and hidden shields that will give ratings at the end of the levels, ranging from fair to outstanding.",
