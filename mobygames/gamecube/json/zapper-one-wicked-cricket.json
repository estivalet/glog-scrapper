  "description": "In this game the player controls a cricket named Zapper on a mission to save his brother. The protagonist will have to pass through six worlds divided into 20 levels, each with hazards to avoid and eggs to capture, meeting both friends and enemies that help and hinder his progress towards a diabolical nest-building magpie named Maggie. Zapper can move in four directions, climb vertical surfaces like trees and walls, and zap opponents with his electric antennae.",
