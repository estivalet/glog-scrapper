  "description": "In the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/summoner\">previous game</a> the summoner Joseph became the god Urath, reborn by uniting the eight rings of summoning. Joseph’s culture hated the goddess Laharah and called her the “goddess of death.”<br><br>This sequel takes place twenty years later in the realms of Halassar, Galdyr and Munari City which are across the world. You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph’s kinship, Maia’s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so.<br><br><i>Summoner 2</i> abandons the combo-based real-time combat of the predecessor and is more action-oriented, with the player directly controlling the physical attacks of the main character. Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia’s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia’s skills improve. It is also possible to choose to adventure in “solo-mode”, leaving the party members behind to go on alone. \n",
