  "description": "You have been chosen to join the reckoning—you are to step into the World of Darkness where humanity is ravaged by vampires and marauding monsters.  As a Hunter, you are immune to these beasts' illusions, but with your power comes a daunting destiny: to destroy these evil beings before mankind is massacred.<br><br><i>Hunter</i> takes place over 23 different stages in which you and up to three of your friends can wield up to twenty different weapons against a horde of enemies.  Each player chooses from one of four classes: the Avenger, Martyr, Defender, or Judge.  Each one possesses different strengths and weaknesses along with their own individual set of spells.  Gameplay can very much be compared to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Gauntlet+series\">Gauntlet games</a>, where you face innumerable odds while building up your own characters in order to take down the ultimate evil.",
