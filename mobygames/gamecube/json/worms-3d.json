  "description": "As depicted very well by the title of the game, the infamous quarrelsome <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=worms\">Worms</a> are squirming for the first time in full 3D.\nThe goal of the game hasn't changed a single bit from its predecessors: the objective is still to crush, annihilate and put into oblivion the worm team of the enemy using massively-wacky weapons of destruction. About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape.<br><br>Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.",
