  "description": "<i>Freestyle Street Soccer</i> known as <i>Urban Freestyle Soccer</i> in Europe is, as the name implies, a Freestyle soccer-game in an urban setting. The game focuses on action and fun instead of realism. You play four on four in five game modes: Turf War, Home Turf, Street Challenge Cup, Exhibition and Multiplayer. The first requires you to conquer neighborhoods in the city by winning soccer matches against rival gangs. Street Challenge Cup allows you to play an entire competition.<br><br>Each player can perform a large variety of moves beyond the typical soccer game moves, such as scissor kicks, midair juggles, and bicycle kicks. Performing said moves allows you to gain skill points that can be used to unlock new game modes, teams, courts, and cheats. Next to these special moves, you can also interact with the environment. Your players can pick things up and throw them around or manually hit your opponents.",
