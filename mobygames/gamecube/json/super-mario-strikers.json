  "description": "Mario plays soccer in this Mario sports game. There are no referees or rules in this version of soccer. The game is played in an arena enclosed within an electric fence, and the players can use items. Bowser shows up from time to time to shake things up. You can steal, pass, shoot, deke, hit other players, and more. Players choose a team captain, sidekicks, and a side. You can choose from play modes such as grudge match, cup battle, custom tournament, and a tutorial. A team captain can also do a super strike which counts as two goals but be careful because an opponent can still hit you. Sidekicks cannot do a super strike but can charge a shot for more power. Players can do a lob pass or ground pass. You can execute a one-timer by shooting as soon as a teammate passes the ball to you. You can hit any opponent but if you hit one who does not possess the ball their team receives an item. You can get an item by scoring a goal.",
