  "description": "Long into the future, where the world is a wasteland full of crime and filth, driving is the only way you can survive. RoadKill is the name of the game, where you build a reputation in your suped-up beast machine of a car, driving it through the burned out city scape of Hell County.<br><br>30 missions are on offer with various objectives (destroy other cars, kill citizens and build alliances with other clans), with your ultimate goal being the leader of the gang that everyone fears.\nWeapons and upgrades keep your car ahead of the pack, but to do so you need to search out the parts. Scavenger hunts for blueprints is the only way to do so, building the ultimate weapons while improving the speed and reliability of your machine.",
