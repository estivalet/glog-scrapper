  "description": "Luigi's Mansion pits you as Luigi, Mario's forgotten brother.<br><br>Luigi, while checking his mail, found out he won a mansion in a contest.  What's weird, is he never entered any contest to begin with.  Being the curious person he is, he calls up his brother, Mario, and asks to meet him at the house.<br><br>Luigi sets forth through a dark and scary jungle to find the house, but sees that Mario is nowhere to be found.  Puzzled, Luigi enters the mansion, only to encounter ghosts.  He meets up with a scientist, Professor E. Gadd, who explains the situation and hands over the Poltergust 3000.  Luigi must now make his way through the mansion's many rooms, sucking up as many ghosts as he can.<br><br>As you explore, you must solve mysteries, collect cash/gems/jewels/coins, and encounter boss characters.  Luigi's vacuum has the ability to suck up ghosts that have inhabited this strange mansion.  However, the ghosts will not give up so easily.  You must struggle with them and pull them back to catch your prey with your trusty vacuum.  As you continue to your goal, you must face off with the deceased denizens of the house and the boos that haunt it, and unlock new rooms with the keys you find along the way.  You can also gain special abilities for your vacuum, such as the ability to shoot fire, water, or ice.  Remember though, treasure is scattered everywhere.  Check all the objects for coins and paper money, and who knows, you may just make enough money for Luigi to buy a mansion of his own...<br><br>As you explore the strange mansion, the plot slowly unravels and it becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on in that haunted house.  Will you ever see your lost brother Mario again? <br><br>The 3DS version has some difference from the Gamecube original. Changes include coins lasting longer before disappearing after being hit,  the addition of local co-op with another player being able to control a character named Gooigi, a new control option that allows the use of the Strobulb flashlight from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/luigis-mansion-dark-moon\"> Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon </a>, an achievement list, and a boss rush mode, among other tweaks. The 3DS version Hidden Mansion follows the adjustments made in the Gamecube's PAL version ",
