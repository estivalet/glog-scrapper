  "description": "Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde is a fast-paced action style real-time strategy game set in the fantasy goblin world of Ogriss.  In it, the player will have the ability to control up to 3 unique clans of ten goblins at one time and use them to wage war in 4 unique and highly destructible environments. Each clan can be controlled either by placing waypoints with the cursor or by taking direct control of them, giving the player the ability to put themselves right in the middle of the action.  Apart from goblins, each clan also has its own unique Turret and Titan that is associated with it: Turrets are defensive structures that can be placed in the world to ward off enemies while Titan’s are huge monstrosities that can be used to wreak havoc upon their enemies. Boasting 17 missions in the single-player campaign as well as 12 split-screen multi-player maps per console, Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde brings RTS to a whole new generation of console fanatics.",
