  "description": "<i>WWE WrestleMania XIX</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wwe-wrestlemania-x8\">WWE WrestleMania X8</a>. The game features a number of additions to the previous game's template, such as more realistic moves, the inclusion of latest WWE superstars, and, most importantly, a new story mode that sees a wrestler created by the player attempting to destroy Vince McMahon's wrestling empire as he prepares for WrestleMania. <br><br>The game features a customizable Create-a-Wrestler mode that allows the player to create and modify an own WWE superstar. It also includes a new Create-an-Entrance mode, which gives the player more control over his superstar's ring entrance. <br><br>Another addition is the WWE Shopzone, in which the player can spend money earned in the Story mode on new attire, weapons, moves, or ability points to increase the strength of the custom superstar.",
