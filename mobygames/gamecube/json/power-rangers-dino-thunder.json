The evil Mesogog wants to return the world to the days that the dinosaurs walked the earth, by harnessing the power of Dino Gems. To stop this evil plan from happening, three students become Dino Thunder Power Rangers, giving them control over mechanical dinosaurs known as DinoZords.<br><br>In the game you take control of a DinoZord and have to complete missions. These range from collecting items, destroying enemies and escorting and defending AI controlled allies. Controllable Zords include the flying Ptera Zord and the walking Tricera and Tyranno Zord.
