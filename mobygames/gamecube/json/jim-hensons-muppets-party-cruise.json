  "description": "The Muppets remember the fun times they had on their last vacation in this 4-player party game.  This game follows the pattern of most party games, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mario-party\">Mario Party</a>, for example, in that your overall goal is to win a board game.  To win the board game, you must succeed at a variety of mini-games, which may include a wide variety of gameplay styles. Winning a mini-game earns you a party favor of a certain color.  The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most party favors to win.  Party favors you win can then be used to unlock additional mini-games and bonus videos.  If you unlock enough mini-games, you can then unlock a new game board in the main game.<br><br>You can choose to play as Gonzo, Animal, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Pepe, or Fonzie.  In addition, a lot of other Muppet characters have cameo appearances.",
