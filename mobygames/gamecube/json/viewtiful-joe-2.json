Once again the side-scrolling action is frantic as you battle through the themed based levels and taking out the enemy with a combat techniques like no other.<br><br>Silvia is ready to play and join the mission, bringing her pompoms and projectile weapons along with her. Joe also has a few new tricks up his sleeve along with some added VFX abilities, including the Replay, where you can record a certain move and play it over three times for a killer blow or a bonus health boost. Another new features is V-Touch, allowing you to switch between the two characters during play, also an important feature to solve some of the puzzles along the way.",
