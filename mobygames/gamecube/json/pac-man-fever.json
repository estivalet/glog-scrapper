  "description": "<i>Pac-Man Fever</i> takes place again!  This time, Pac-Man is throwing a party and has invited his other Namco friends to join in the activities. Players can choose for the six following characters:<br><br>Pac-Man (from Pac-Man), Ms. Pac-Man (from Ms. Pac-Man), Heihachi Mishima (from Tekken), Tiger Jackson (from Tekken), Astaroth (from Soul Calibur), and Reiko (from Ridge Racer).<br><br>Gameplay is similar to Nintendo's <i>Mario Party</i>, in which each player competes in a set of mini-games to advance around the board of three various worlds (Medieval, Space and Tropical).<br><br>Players set the length of the game (short, medium, long) and play in rounds. Each round begins with a mini-game which determines how far a player can move on the board. Each tile on the board enables players to move forward or go backward, lose, gain, or steal tokens, play a single or two player mini-game, spend earned tokens, or a raffle game to earn redemption tickets.<br><br>With store tiles, players can spend tokens to move forward, move other players backward, buy raffle tickets, or gamble for more tokens.<br><br>Once a player reaches the end of the board, players receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can be used to buy each mini-game separately for tournament play outside the game. Once all the mini-games have been purchased, players can add up all of their tickets to total up their overall high score.",
