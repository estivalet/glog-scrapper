  "description": "<i>Need For Speed: Underground</i> is the seventh game in the long running <i>Need For Speed</i> racing series. <br><br>The game revolves around illegal night time street racing with heavily modified import cars and has been greatly influenced by the movie <i>the Fast And The Furious</i> and its sequel. Players get the chance to build their own racing machine almost from the ground up, with hundreds or real licensed parts and lots of licensed cars, including the Mazda RX-7 and the Nissan Skyline GT-R. The game also features over 100 single player races and a hip hop/hard rock soundtrack including artists such as Mystikal, Rob Zombie, and the Crystal Method.",
