  "description": "<i>Disney Sports Skateboarding</i>, much as the title implies, is a skateboarding game based on the Disney license.  It features eight levels set around the world and many favorite Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy.<br><br>Like most modern skateboarding games, the structure of <i>Disney Sports Skateboarding</i> owes much to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tony+Hawk%27s+Pro+Skater+Series\">Tony Hawk series</a>.  Here, the trick system is far simpler as there's no balance meter and most tricks require fewer buttons.  Each level has a set of goals that must be accomplished in order to progress, such as a high score goal, knocking over objects, or completing a checkpoint race.",
