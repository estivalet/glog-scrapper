  "description": "Based on and around the 3D animated movie of the same name, the game allows the player to control Shrek, a huge green ogre who's life has changed for the worse when every Fairy Tale character known to children wind up in his house. With the never ending talk of Donkey following him along his path, Shrek must rescue Princess Fiona from the dragon, as requested by Farquaad, while finding his way through crazy characters from the fairy (and not so fairy) tale kingdom.<br><br>New characters and events stir up further adventure as the player relives the events from the movie in this third-person action game. Shrek bashes and burps his way past various challenges, fighting knights and other evil things while collecting items to boost his health and power.",
