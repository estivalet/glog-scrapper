  "description": "You play as one of four monkeys, each one trapped inside a transparent ball.  You are tasked with reaching the goal in each level by tilting the playing field, resulting in your monkey &quot;rolling&quot; forward or backward. Several obstacles lay in between your monkey and the goal, and a time limit means you can never spend too long on a given level. Bananas are found across the levels, which both contribute to your score and grant an extra life per 100 collected.<br><br>The three main difficulty levels are Beginner, Advanced, and Expert, each of which offers more maps to play and a greater challenge. EX and Master levels are unlocked by performing well on these maps. A Competition mode allows multiple players to play these levels simultaneously on a split screen.<br><br>There are also various mini-games for you to unlock, such as Monkey Billiards and Monkey Bowling.",
