  "description": "The updated port of the original Xbox version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xbox/wreckless-the-yakuza-missions\">Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions</a> adds several new features. Missions are now ranked based on how quickly they are completed, and fast times reward medals. By completing a bonus objective on hard mode, such as destroying traffic, a bonus mission will be unlocked. Earning a gold medal in a bonus mission will further unlock a cheat code, like unlimited time or low gravity. A free mode is available now too, allowing the player to drive through the city without worrying about a time limit. Finally two new features have been added to the cars: an adrenaline feature that slows down time, and a limited supply of short-range missiles.<br><br>A new multiplayer mode allows two players to play on a single screen, with the camera following the trailing player. Different modes are available, such as a mode where the trailing car attempts to ram the leading car, or a normal racing mode.",
