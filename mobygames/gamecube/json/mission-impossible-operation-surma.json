  "description": "<i>Operation Surma</i> is a stealth action game that puts the player in the role of the top-secret government agent Ethan Hunt, with settings based on the <i>Mission Impossible</i> movies. The story does not follow any of the movies, nor does the main character resemble Tom Cruise; however, everything else, from various gadgets and disguising is present. Following the story, the player will unfold many mysteries behind the ICE Worm virus developed by the Surma Corporation that makes them only one step to global domination, and will have to prevent that from happening using any means necessary.",
