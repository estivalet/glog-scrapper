  "description": "Jack Driscoll, scriptwriter, follows director Carl Dernham and actress Ann Darrow to Skull Island where Dernham intends to film his next movie. But primeval creatures await them: giant insects, dinosaurs, and King Kong. Based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Peter+Jackson\">Peter Jackson's</a> 2005 remake, King Kong lets you play as Jack Driscoll and Kong himself.<br><br>Jack's levels are HUDless FPS levels set on Skull Island.  Jack must use a variety of weapons, traps, and fire to kill or repel Skull Island's fauna.  Kong's levels are third-person brawlers set on Skull Island and New York City, where Kong must puzzle his way through environmental obstacles and thrash his opponents.<br><br>The PSP version is shorter, with some parts cut out which featured in the console and PC releases.<br><br>",
