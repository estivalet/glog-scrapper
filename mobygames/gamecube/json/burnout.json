In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.<br><br>There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA.  There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.<br><br>One notable feature of Burnout is the &quot;Burn Meter.&quot;  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.  If you crash, however, the Burn Meter is reset and must be filled again to achieve a boost.",
