  "description": "Slightly unusual for a tricks/stunt game, BMX XXX adds a twist to its genre by employing themes involving foul language, nudity, and toilet humor.<br><br>The &quot;Hardcore Tour&quot; mode has you playing the levels, pulling off tricks and completing goals to unlock things such as new levels or stripper videos. The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an ice cream man or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also, have to watch out for a health bar that accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.<br><br>Do well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well... <br><br>There's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two-player split-screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.",
