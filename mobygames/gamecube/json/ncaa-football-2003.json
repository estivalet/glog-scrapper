New features in NCAA Football for the 2003 season include over 200 licensed fight songs, 3D cheerleaders and 144 different schools.<br><br>Dynasty mode has been enhanced with the ability to redshirt a player and schedule your non-conference games before each season.  In Dynasty Mode you can win all the real trophies to add to your own personal collection which you can show off later.  These awards include the Heisman, Coach of the Year and Bowl-specific trophies.  You can also win special trophies for winning certain rivalry games, which is another new play mode in 2003.  There are 23 different &quot;Rivalry&quot; trophies for you to earn to go alongside your Dynasty trophies.  <br><br>Create-A-School mode makes it into this edition, letting you create your own football team.

Your created team can be played in Exhibition play or imported into Dynasty mode.<br><br>The last notable feature new to NCAA Football 2003 is the customizable interface.
