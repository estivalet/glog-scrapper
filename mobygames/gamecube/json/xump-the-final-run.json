  "description": "This version of <i>Xump</i> is an extended remake of the puzzle game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Xump%3a+The+Final+Run\">Xump: The Final Run</a> (which in turn is similar to the C64 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sensitive\">Sensitive</a>) with improved graphics and new levels.<br><br>The goal is still the same: With your bot &quot;Xump&quot; you will have to remove all blue tiles on platforms somewhere in the sky by moving over them. A bit of planning is required, as you (obviously) can move onto such a blue tile only once. The levels have a time limit, so it's required to think quickly.<br><br>Apart from the blue tiles the game also contains solid grey tiles that won't disappear, teleporters to move between two locations, bombs that act as a second layer for the tile (so you have to visit the tile twice to remove it) and arrows that will automatically push you into the arrow's direction.",
