  "description": "<i>NFL Blitz Pro</i> is the 2003 entry in Midway's arcade football series. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nhl-hitz-pro\">NHL Hitz Pro</a> however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can &quot;catch on fire&quot;. The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays.<br><br>Game modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates.<br><br>The game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games. Available for purchase are fantasy teams and stadiums, and new game modes: in Butterfingaz mode, every hit leads to a fumble, while Cyberleague features robot teams and an exploding ball. Also available is the customary Big Head mode, among several others. Old-school Blitz series arcade gameplay is available in Blitz Classic mode.",
