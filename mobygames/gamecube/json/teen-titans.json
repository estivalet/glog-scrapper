Players control the five team members: Robin, Cyborg, Raven, Starfire and Beast Boy and can switch between them at any time.  Each character has a unique set of powers and moves.  In addition to the standard combos, in co-op modem characters can perform team moves together for added damage.  There are power-ups to be found through the game which speed the world slow it down, increase your attack, etc.  The game is set up as a series of levels and after completing a level, each heroes' abilities are upgraded.<br><br>The Titans receive a video game in the mail, but find themselves trapped inside when they try to play it.  They must battle their way through many enemies, including bosses drawn from the show, to escape.<br><br>There is also a multiplayer mode which works something like a four-player fighting game.  This can be played against bots or with other humans.  In addition to the Titans themselves, you can play as the bosses from single-player or more than a dozen other characters from the show that are unlocked by finding hidden items in story mode.",
