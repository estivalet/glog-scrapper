Game modes include single-player &quot;Just Dance&quot; (for high score) and &quot;Dance Workout&quot; (with a calorie instead of a score counter) and two-player &quot;Dance Together&quot; (cooperative) and &quot;Dance FaceOff&quot; (competitive).<br><br>The game includes two different gameplay styles: &quot;Scroll&quot; follows the DDR model of vertically-scrolling arrows representing steps to be made on the mat (or buttons to be pressed on the controller) once they reach a line on the screen in rhythm with the music. &quot;Spin&quot; shows the arrows emerging from the center of the screen moving in the four compass directions instead.
