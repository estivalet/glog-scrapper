  "description": "The game of ten-pin bowling sees players attempt to knock down an arrangement of 10 pins in a triangular shape, by bowling a ball down a gutter-lined path. You have two shots, and score for how many you knock down on each bowl. As a reward for knocking down all ten pins, you will also get the score from your next bowl doubled if this took 2 shots (known as a 'spare'), or your next two bowls if it took 2 shots (known as a 'Strike').<br><br>In this implementation, you can play in one of 8 different settings, including a tropical island, ancient Egypt or on a pirate ship. There are 8 different AI players, each with varied appearance and reaction, and variable bowling ability. A range of playing modes including Tournament Play, Skins and practice are featured. Controls are designed to be easy to use, and ball reactions incorporate physics, ball friction and delivery style.",
