  "description": "You play a young Pokémon Trainer in the Orre Region, two years after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-colosseum\">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.  An evil organization has been kidnapping Pokémon and shutting the door to their hearts in order to turn them into Shadow Pokémon, built only to attack. <br><br>While trying to complete the research on the Purify Chamber (an invention that is supposed to restore the Shadow Pokémon to their original state), Prof. Krane was kidnapped by the evil-doers.<br><br>With Eevee by your side, you must rescue Prof. Krane while &quot;snagging&quot; any Shadow Pokémon you come across and opening the door to their hearts.<br><br><i>Pokémon XD</i>, like its predecessors, is a role-playing game with turn-based battles.  What makes it different from previous Pokémon games is that it features a more developed story with many characters to meet and interact as well as locations to explore.  <br><br>This game also includes combat-mode where you can battle against 1 or 3 other players.",
