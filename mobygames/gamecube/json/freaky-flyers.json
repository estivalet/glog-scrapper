  "description": "This cartoon style racing game replaces the usual kart formula with planes (and all sorts of flying technology, such as UFOs, flying carpets, and plenty more). <br><br>Choose from one of the many different, and wacky, characters and take to the sky over various locations, each with its own set of obstacles and shortcuts. Each character has a different level of ability (for example, one may be highly accurate in cornering but slow, while another is much faster but less responsive in turning).<br><br>Apart from the usual race modes, you can also take on a 4 player race (split-screen only).",
