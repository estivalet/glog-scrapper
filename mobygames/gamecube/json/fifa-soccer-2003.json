  "description": "FIFA 2003 continues the trend of improving each year's new release by keeping the formula that worked, while also adding new features to make the game more enjoyable.<br><br>Some of these new features including a &quot;Freestyle&quot; control, which is activated by the right thumbstick, causing you to do special moves, such as a deke, or kick the ball a fair length forwards to gain some speed.<br><br>New and improved &quot;dead ball&quot; control makes corner kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and gives you more options.  The passing game has been improved to allow better passing by kicking directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in particular, or open passing to allow anybody to take it.<br><br>FIFA 2003 includes all FIFA clubs, leagues, and players.",
