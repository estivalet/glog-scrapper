  "description": "As Conan returns from another successful adventure, he finds that a band of masked warriors has destroyed his village and murdered his uncle, bad move. Now it's time for Revenge! <br><br>&quot;Conan&quot; is a 3D hack'n'slash action title that blends RPG elements by awarding experience points for each defeated enemy. Said points can be spent on a plethora of fighting skills which are then triggered via a simple combo system for spectacular results as you battle hordes of human warriors and supernatural monsters from beyond in your quest for revenge. Should you fall to a well-placed blow, Conan offers you the chance to try and regain your honor in the domains of Crom, where a small arena fight can restore your honor and bring you back to life and continue the game or damn you to eternity should you fail. <br><br>Also available is a multiplayer Arena mode in which you can duke it out mano-a-mano with other human players as Conan or a selection of original characters. Features the original licensed soundtrack from the Conan movies by Basil Poledouris.",
