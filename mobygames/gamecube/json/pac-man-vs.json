Teamwork becomes vital as they try to hunt down <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Pac+Man\">Pac Man</a>, the ghost who eats <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Pac+Man\">Pac Man</a> then gets the Game Boy Advance and tries his luck as the hunted.<br><br>\nIf Four players are not available computers will act as any ghost not directly controlled by a player. Computer ghost can not hurt <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Pac+Man\">Pac Man</a> unless they have been touched by a human controlled ghost. Which ever human player touches them first will get control of the game boy if the computer catches <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Pac+Man\">Pac Man</a>. ",
