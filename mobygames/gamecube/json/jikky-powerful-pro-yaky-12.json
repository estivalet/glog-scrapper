  "description": "<i>Jikky? Powerful Pro Yaky? 12</i> is the 12th installment in the series of baseball games by Konami. It features a tournament mode with 12 real professional teams and 15 high school teams, exhibition mode (for one or two players), and the series trademark Success mode, where players create a player character and train him to become a professional baseball player.<br><br>New to this installment is the Cheering Songs Editor: players can create their own cheering chants. A password system allows the transfer of players and chants to other installments in the series.<br><br>The game is viewed from a behind view when pitching and hitting and a bird's eye view when the ball is hit. The characters as usual are cartoony figures composed of spherical forms.",
