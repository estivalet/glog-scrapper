  "description": "The third <i>Donkey Konga</i> game adds the usual batch of new songs, including homages to classic NES games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sky-kid\">Sky Kid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Balloon+Fight\">Balloon Fight</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Mario+Bros+3\">Super Mario Bros 3</a> (Japanese version). The game is meant to be played with the DK Bongos input device. You have to hit one drum, the other, both or clap when the cursor passes the corresponding circle on the screen to match the rhythm. As you hit the beats, the corner in the top-right corner of the screen will fill up. In the story mode, you need to reach a certain mark to pass. Filling it up completely is awarded a gold medal and victory music.<br><br>A new addition, next to the cast of Donkey Kong characters from the previous game, is Funky Kong, who hosts several game modes and appears in the mini-games. The amount of those small games has been limited, only Rhythm Banana and Trial Mode remain. With different difficulty levels, you can do solo runs, duets with the computer or another player, and even quartets. Coins can be exchanged in the shopping mall for new music.",
