  "description": "The citizens on Nanashi Island have the custom of organizing a ceremony to celebrate children's transition into adulthood. The young Pockle, however, has slept through his own ceremony. Missing the ceremony is considered a crime and he is thrown into prison. Mayer, the mayor of the island, agrees to grant Pockle freedom with some significant restrictions: his face is blurred out, he must adhere to an early curfew and is under constant surveillance by a robotic police chief. Pockle also has to find a way to raise five million &quot;mane&quot; (the game's currency) to reimburse the organizers of the event. After engaging in menial jobs, Pockle realizes that his true destination in life is to fulfill people's wishes and make them happy, otherwise he is doomed to stay a child forever.<br><br><i>Giftpia</i> is an adventure game with light role-playing elements, similar in concept and execution to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/moon-remix-rpg-adventure\">Moon</a>. Much of the gameplay consists of various tasks and colorful mini-games involving the exotic islanders. There is no combat in the game; RPG elements consist of managing the main character's life and increasing his wealth, which serves as one of the game's final goals. Pockle has a stamina meter represented by hearts; their amount can be increased by finding additional hearts in the game world. The player needs to feed the protagonist and allow him to sleep regularly.<br><br>The game's world is open-ended; though the overall objective is helping people and earning money, the player is for the most part free to decide how to achieve that, participating in many tasks and activities in no particular order, though some of them must be completed to open up new gameplay possibilities. The game also features a day and night cycle.",
