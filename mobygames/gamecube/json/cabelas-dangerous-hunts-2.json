  "description": "<i>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2</i> is a hunting game focused on linear story-based gameplay, instead of the freeform hunting of the main Cabela's line. You will hunt 20 animals, including lions, tigers, and bears, across 12 main levels, and 4 hidden levels. There are three difficulty levels, and a slow-motion ability to help line up shots. Keep your eyes open; there are secret stumps in each level, which if shot can unlock extra levels and other items. In most levels, you will be assisted by a native guide, who will both draw the attention of the local wildlife, and assist you in killing them.<br><br>The story features you, a world-famous hunter, who has just found out an old friend, Bullseye Bill, is missing. Retrace his steps around the world, helping other people along the way.",
