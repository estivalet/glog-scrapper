  "description": "EA's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fight-night\">Fight Night</a> returns in its second installment. Once again, you can create a new boxer and start a career that begins as an amateur in a shady gym somewhere in Queens, NY, and fight your way up to the top. Alternatively, you could relive the careers of some legendary boxers.<br><br>Of course, you could go for a simple match with either a computer or a live opponent.<br><br>Round 2 offers many new features, like fancy particle effects that show blood and sweat spraying into the camera in ultra slow-motion. The &quot;Total Boxer Control&quot;, which lets you throw punches by making certain movements with the analog stick, has been improved. There are also many ways to customize the appearance of your character, up to the shaping of the cranium and ears.<br><br>The soundtrack consists of a dozen contemporary (but unfortunately edited) hip-hop tracks.<br><br>All the previous features are still there too: You can play online (now on Xbox too), and you can unlock more moves, clothes, and equipment as you proceed in career mode.<br><br>Also, included in the GameCube version is a port of the SNES game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Punch-Out%21%21\">Super Punch-Out!!</a>",
