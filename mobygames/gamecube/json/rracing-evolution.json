  "description": "<i>R:Racing Evolution</i> is a racing game featuring several modes of gameplay:<br><br><b>Racing Life</b>: This is a single player story mode. You play the part of Rena Hayami who begins the story as an ambulance driver. After successfully racing the vehicle to the hospital, you're offered a chance to drive a racecar. Rena's saga to become champion and defeat her rivals will unfold in various cut scenes between races and driving challenges that you must complete. There are 14 chapters total. <br><br><b>Event Challenge</b>: There are a variety of racing events you can enter, each with an entrance few you must earn by winning previous challenges. You can also tune up your car or buy new cars.<br><br><b>Arcade Mode</b>: Here you can run a single race against computer controlled cars on the track of your choice. You can set several game options, such as the number of laps and rival cars.<br><br><b>Time Attack</b>: Choose a racetrack and car, and try to earn the best time!<br><br><b>VS. Mode</b>: This is a two player game. Choose a track, and two players race for either the best time or earn the most points.<br><br>The game features a variety of racing options you can set, including brake assist (will automatically brake for you if you enter a turn too fast), transmission types (automatic or manual), race difficulty, and adjustments to your cars performance. There are a variety of cars available, each with unique speed and steering characteristics. You can also unlock more cars by playing Racing Life and Event Challenge.  There is also a pressure meter: when driving behind another vehicle, you will begin to apply psychological pressure to the driver which is indicated by a meter above the car. When full, the driver will be very likely to make a mistake giving you an opportunity to pass easily! There is an instant replay option, and you can save your best (or worst!) races for viewing later on.",
