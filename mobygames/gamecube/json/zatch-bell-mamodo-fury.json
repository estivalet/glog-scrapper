  "description": "Every 1000 years, a tournament takes place on Earth to decide the most powerful Mamodo. This time, Zatch Bell is determined to win. The only problem? He can't fight alone. Assisting him is the human Kiyo, who, by reading spells from a book, can activate Zatch's powers.<br><br>In this 3D fighting game, you will control Kiyo, or one of 19 other characters, each with a associated Mamodo. You can either attack your opponent directly, or have your Mamodo attack with a spell. (Four attack spells, one defensive spell, and one super spell.) You can even switch control to your Mamodo directly, though this leaves you defenseless.<br><br><i>Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury</i> features a rather long story mode, stage select mode, 1 and 2 player vs. mode, arcade mode, and several types of mini-games, for 1 to 4 players.",
