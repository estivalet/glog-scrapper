  "description": "<b>NHL 2K3</b> is the first hockey game on the XBox to support XBox Live.<br><br>Using it's partnership with the ESPN sports network, Sega has created NHL 2K3 using the same presentation method as ESPN.  Natural camera transitions, cut scenes, and overlay graphics are all used in cooperation with ESPN to give the game a more realistic feel.<br><br>All the standard game modes are here, from exhibition games and playoff games, to a very in depth Franchise mode that gives you complete control over your team.  You act as the general manager, coach, scout and player.  You can negotiate contracts, make trades, and draft rookies.<br><br>On the ice, you have a lot of control over your team as well.  You can anchor lines with key players, rotate your lines to always be matched up, and make sure you have the advantage every which way.<br><br>You can also play online via XBox System Link or XBox Live.  The latter allows you to connect to a player from anywhere, and engage in a game of hockey.  Using the headset, you can taunt or compliment your opponent, without any interruption to the game.<br><br>Rosters are from the 2002-2003 season.",
