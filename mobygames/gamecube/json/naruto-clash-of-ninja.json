  "description": "<i>Shonen Jump's Naruto: Clash of Ninja</i> is a cel-shaded one-on-one fighting game based on the manga/anime of the same name which follows the adventures of Naruto as he tries to become the Hokage, the ninja  leader of Konoha, Village of the Hidden Leaf. It features characters from the franchise such as Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, plus others making for a roster of eight selectable fighters.<br><br>Each fighter has basic punches and kicks, throws, and a character specific special move in their arsenal. A special ability becomes usable after a fighter's Chakra Meter is filled all the way, which is done by either receiving or inflicting damage. Fighters can also perform a teleport type move but performing it will cost the fighter some of their energy.<br><br>The game has several modes such as a Story mode, with interspersing cutscenes between fights, a two player battle mode, a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a training mode. The game's extras include a gallery, character profiles, and a sound test. Fights take place at varying locales such as the academy's rooftop and schoolyard, the Forest of Death, and the Ichiraku Ramen Shop for a total of eight areas.",
