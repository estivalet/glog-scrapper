Armed with her sense of humor and trusty staff, harness the power of the Skittles to defeat Necroth’s minions, solve ancient mysteries and ultimately save the world.<br><br>As the witty, and often sarcastic, Skye, you’ll be running, jumping and battling your way across medieval lands depicted in three-dimensional detail.
