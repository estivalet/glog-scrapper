  "description": "Create your skier or snowboarder and get on the slopes in this version of the SSX franchise. With a different front end interface to previous versions, which looks like a mix between MTV and a doodle book, you select the challenge you want to take part in rather than boarding your way to the event as previous versions.<br><br>With improved controls making &quot;Monster Jumps&quot; (Uber Tricks) easier to perform, everyone can look like a professional without learning button combos. As before, if you perform the same trick over and over, you won't get the points to take your skier/snowboarder from a novice to what they have a labeled &quot;black-diamond-dominating rockstar&quot;.<br><br>The game promises big jumps, fast pace and lots of coloured, detailed slopes.<br><br>The GameCube version delivers Mario, Luigi and Peaches on the slopes as special characters. Each has their own moves and is accompanied by Mario-style music.",
