  "description": "<i>NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup</i> marks a change in name for the series, but continues the style of gameplay and game modes from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=NASCAR+Thunder\">NASCAR Thunder</a> titles.<br><br>Four new racing series have been added for this year; in addition to NEXTEL cup cars, players can race in the Featherlite Modified, Craftsman Truck, Nascar National (Busch), or production car series. Each type of car has its own unique feel and gives a different on-track experience. Real-life driver rivalries and confrontations are brought into the game with the enhanced grudges and alliances system. Computer drivers will remember whether you drive naughty or nice, and will payback favors in kind. The new Intimidator feature allows you to shake up an opponent by getting behind him and putting on the pressure.<br><br>In fight to the top mode, players can follow the career of their driver by starting in the Modified series and working their way up the NASCAR ranks. Performing well in races, as well as participating in autograph sessions, affects fan support, which in turn improves the driver's income.<br><br>Online support for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox allow up to four players to compete in a full 43-car field.",
