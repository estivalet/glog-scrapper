  "description": "A kart-race game with Pac-Man and other characters from previous Pac-Man games and other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Namco\">Namco</a> franchises. For instance the PlayStation Portable version features <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mr-driller\">Mr. Driller</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mappy\">Mappy</a> and the Prince from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Katamari+Damacy\">Katamari Damacy </a>.<br><br>The game is packed with not only the traditional Dots to consume and enemies to avoid, but also with power-ups and temporary advantages which players should use strategically to win the race and beat opponents. One example is a power slide to turn corners at full speed. Of course, enemies can also be bitten after eating a Power Pellet.",
