And in the twisted world of <i>Ribbit King</i>, it's not just about winning the Frolf Cup and Super Ribbinite prize, it's about saving your planet, Hippitron.<br><br><i>Ribbit King</i> stretches the twenty course Frolf tournament over five unique worlds with a wide cast of characters.  Every planet has its own unique obstacles including dangerous plants and animals poised to pounce on your frog.  Adding a random factor, your frog has a mind of his own.  Power-ups allow frogs to fly farther, swim faster, and modify your frog's behavior in the wild.<br><br><i>Ribbit King</i> has a story mode and versus mode and supports up to four players.",
