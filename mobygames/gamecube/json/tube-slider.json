  "description": "Race around fast and futuristic race tracks in some of the most high tech cars ever created. Each hover craft has the ability to get to very high speeds at a simple touch of a button, while side boosters allow you to take sharp turns at full tilt and turbo (if you really want to go even faster) gives you an added boost for a short amount of time.<br><br>The 10 tracks on offer can be completed either in Grand Prix, Time Trial or Free Ride modes. Grand Prix has you competing one race after the other for the grand prize. The higher you finish, the better the chance to progress and win the title.<br><br>4 players are also supported.",
