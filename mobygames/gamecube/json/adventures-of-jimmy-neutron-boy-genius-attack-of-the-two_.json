  "description": "<i>The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius - Attack of the Twonkies</i> is an action-adventure game based on a Nickelodeon Special of the same name.<br><br>The game starts with Jimmy demonstrating one of his new inventions in front of his classmates. Suddenly principal Willoughby comes in and announces that students from the Lindbergh school have been asked to sing at the opening of a new stadium in town. While the rest of the class is busy preparing for the auditions for the opening, Jimmy is off to his lab to make preparations for visiting a comet. After exploring the comet Jimmy returns to his ship and sees how an alien monster is trying to destroy his ship. Jimmy barely escapes and returns to earth telling the story to Carl and Sheen when Carl notices a little creature in the mineral samples Jimmy brought back from the comet. The creature quickly transforms into a monster and is multiplying. Now the monsters have to be captured before they take over the town.<br><br>In the game, you play as Jimmy, with a goal to eliminate the spread of mischievous aliens using a variety of homemade devices, elaborately created as you collect bits and pieces during the journey. Intergalactic travel, crazy labs, and weird planetscapes are the places Jimmy finds himself in his quest to bring peace and calm to mother earth. In the game, your main goal is to collect the escaping Twinkies, whilst problem-solving, clue collecting, and teaming up with the other various characters of the Jimmy Universe, not forgetting being aided by the trusty sidekick Goddard.",
