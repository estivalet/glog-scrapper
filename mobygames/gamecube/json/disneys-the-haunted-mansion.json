  "description": "In <i>Disney's The Haunted Mansion</i>, an action game based on a combination of the popular Disneyland attraction and the 2003 movie of the same name, players guide Zeke Holloway through the house of 999 happy haunts in order to solve a mystery, put the spirits to rest, and get out of the house alive. They are allowed full roam of the mansion, once they collect enough Shriveled Souls inside their Beacon of Souls, a special lantern designed to collect the various lesser ghosts throughout the rooms.<br><br>Though Zeke handles his quest alone, he is aided by Madame Leota and six friendly ghosts, who will provide hints and items throughout the journey. As Zeke solves puzzles, completes various tasks, and helps to rid the house of its evil spirits, these spiritual companions will provide Soul Gems, which amplifies the power of the Soul Beacon. Once fully charged, Zeke will have the ability to face the main spirit, Atticus Thorn, for the final showdown.",
