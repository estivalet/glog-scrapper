  "description": "Play as the three Charlie's Angels girl private investigators in this game based on the characters of the two movie versions played by Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu.  \nThe franchise started out as a popular 70's television series.  In the game, popular world landmarks are disappearing: the Statue Of Liberty, Arc de Triomphe, Lincoln Memorial, and Stonehenge.   <br><br>The girls must find out who is behind this and start out at a beach beauty pageant runway wearing bikinis and move on through other levels on ships, islands, or monasteries.  The gameplay is a 3D brawler beat'em up where the girls go to various world locations and take out bad guys with kicks, punches, jumps, and combo moves.  They can also block attacks and use blunt objects found in the environment to smash enemies.  Occasionally, there'll be a computer terminal or button to activate, or ladder to climb.  There are some slow-motion and cinematic camera angles at times.\nDefeat bosses to move onwards.  Hidden throughout the levels are items such as movie reels and memory sticks that when collected can unlock photos and trailers from the movie Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.",
