  "description": "Frogger just got back from his adventure at the Temple of the Frog and is enjoying life in the swamp. Before long, it's his birthday, and he is summoned to the Elder Council. Frogger has come of age, and it is time for him to complete his rite of passage. Each of the 8 council members will send Frogger to a different world, where he will be tested to prove his readiness to be a teenage frog.<br><br>This game follows the gameplay model seen in the Game Boy Advance Frogger games. You play the game from an overhead view and must move Frogger to the end of many maze-like, trap ridden levels.",
