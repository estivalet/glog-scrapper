  "description": "After rescuing his people from the hands of death, Abe finds himself teaming up with another creature that needs his help, a little gabbit named Munch. With Abe helping him out, Munch must stop the evil Glukkons' plan of enslaving Abe's race once again, while protecting his own race from doom.<br><br>Both Abe and Munch are playable as you use their powers to get past the guards, or use them to your own advantage. Abe's people can also lend a helping hand in fighting off creatures or solving puzzles, while you guide them away from danger. Munch can also control Fuzzles, small critters that can be deadly in packs against enemies.",
