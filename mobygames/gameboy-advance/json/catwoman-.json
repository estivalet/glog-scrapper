  "description": "The Game Boy Advance version of the Catwoman movie license is a straightforward isometric action/ platform game. The player has at his disposal all the key abilities of the cat-lady as seen in the movie, and must traverse levels full of platforms and &quot;bad guys&quot;, and climbing walls, occasionally.<br><br>The game opens with a tutorial mission and then switches to a series of images resembling comic-strips that explain how Patience Phillips became Catwoman. The player then goes through the 24 levels of the game mostly jumping, climbing and sometimes fighting.<br><br>The look of the graphics aims toward a comic-book feel instead of the more realistic looking 3D of the console and PC versions.",
