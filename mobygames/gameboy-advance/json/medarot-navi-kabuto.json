  "description": "In <i>Medarot Navi: Kabuto</i>, a boy named Kasumi Asano discovers an alien Medabot named Mistral under the auditorium of an abandoned school. When his class takes a field trip to the modular space station Cluster, it separates and goes adrift, forcing Kasumi to reunite the students and save the space station.<br><br>As Kasumi, the player must liberate each Module of the Cluster from the Space Robos. Once a Module is liberated, a classmate must be stationed there to prevent it from being retaken. In battle, up to five Medabots can be used. Winning the battle rewards Kasumi with a random part from the enemy team. Some Modules have Parts Research centers, and allies posted at these Modules will be able to develop new Medabot parts.",
