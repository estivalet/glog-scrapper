  "description": "<i>Open Season</i> for GBA is based on the film, and is quite different from the <a id=\"db9bac64aa78bc15d2fe3c0e98e4034e5\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=open+season\">console version</a>. The story in this version mostly follows the movie. A grizzly bear named Boog is very happy with his domesticated home. One day, he gets in trouble with a one-antlered mule deer named Elliot, and the town's authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately for them, the hunting season has just begun, and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker Beth, a park ranger who raised Boog since he was a little cub. <br><br>The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. The player controls Boog, who has various moves at his disposal. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals, as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters, who all work for Shaw, a hunting fanatic who wants to kill Boog and Elliot. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is the player's job to scare them off and clean up the forest.",
