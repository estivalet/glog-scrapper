  "description": "<i>Roland Garros French Open 2002</i> is the 2002 version of the annual Roland Garros tennis game. It sports an official license for the Roland Garros and US Open tournaments. The game comes with 4 official and 6 fictional players. The Game Boy Advance version of the game is mostly the same as its bigger brother on the PC and PlayStation 2. Differences are mostly of a graphical nature (2D instead of 3D). It does lack one of the game modes however and controls tailored to the handheld console.<br><br>The game features the following game modes: arcade, training, exhibition, career, and multi-player. All modes can be played in both singles and doubles. The arcade mode allows you to unlock new courts, players and gear. In the career mode you can start out small and use the cash prizes to further train your character and buy better gear.<br><br>With a link cable you can play with and against up to four friends.",
