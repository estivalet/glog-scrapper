  "description": "<i>High Heat Major League Baseball 2002</i> marks the first appearance of 3DO's baseball series on a handheld platform. It is also the first MLB-licensed baseball game released for the Game Boy Advance.<br><br>Available game modes include Exhibition, Season (16, 81 or 162 games), Playoffs, Home Run Derby and Practice. Season progress is saved to battery-backed RAM. Automatic fielding can be toggled and game length can be set from 1 to 9 innings.<br><br>Batting and pitching are done from a view behind the batter. Pitchers can either throw a fastball or select from a variety of special throws on a pitching cursor. Which pitches are available depends on the athlete's skill set. Batting works without aiming and simply requires correct timing when swinging or bunting. Fielding is done on an isometric view of the field. Advanced playing techniques like picking off players, stealing bases, hit-and-runs or beaning are not possible.\n",
