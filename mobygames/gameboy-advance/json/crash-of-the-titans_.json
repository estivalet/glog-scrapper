Crash jumps, punches, and smashes his way through six island locations in search of Wumpa Fruit, Tiki Masks, and other collectibles. Along the way, he'll encounter Cortex's titular henchmen, which he'll have to climb on top and hijack to take their combat powers. By jacking the right combination of foes, he'll eventually gain the powers he needs to take on Neo Cortex himself and save Wumpa Island yet again.<br><br><br><br>\n",
