  "description": "During a little trip, young Wade Hixton finds himself stranded as his car breaks down. Luckily, or unluckily for him, a small town is nearby. Calling in for help, he find the people of Big Piney more then happy to help ... at a price. Wade must now strap on the boxing gloves and fight his way around the town against a range of strange characters ready to punch his lights out. To make enough money to fix the car, and make it out of the town alive, he'll be put to the test in and out of the ring.<br><br>The non-linear style of the game leaves you with all the options. You will choose who to fight, who to trust to make the right business decisions, and who your hard earned money should be spent on to purchase their help at a time of crisis in the ring. Wade's life and his car rest in your gloved hands.",
