  "description": "The escaped convict Brickster has taken the opportunity of his new found freedom to do the nefarious deed of ripping out 15 pages of the Constructopedia, \nLEGO Island's building blueprint book, and scattered the pages throughout the island. Now it's up to Pepper Roni, a skateboarding pizza delivery boy to find the pages and send Brickster back to jail.<br><br>Players control Pepper Roni and go around the island trying to locate the Constructopedia pages. Pepper can give the pages he found to certain characters who in turn will build a structure that will help improve the island. Pepper will also have to partake in various mini-games throughout the game. Also, finding hidden Lego character cards is the games reward for observant exploration of the island.<br><br>Although Pepper can't be killed, he will have to deal with the Brickster-Bot enemies by either bumping into them or stunning them with a pizza throw. <br><br>",
