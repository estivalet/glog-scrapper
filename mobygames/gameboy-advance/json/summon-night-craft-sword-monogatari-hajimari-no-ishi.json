  "description": "Third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Summon+Night\">Summon Night</a> &quot;Swordcraft&quot; action-RPG spin-offs. You take the role of a young craftsknight (a combination of knight and weaponsmith) whose master has been recently murdered. His guardian creature appears to you and admits to being responsible for his death, and joins you to try to atone for its sins as you attempt to unravel the conspiracy that caused his death and also finish your training.<br><br>As the other games in the series the game is a top-down action RPG in which you explore the game world talking to NPCs for items and clues and dungeon-crawl to gather the materials needed to create your weapons. When in combat, the game switches to a side-scrolling view in which you attack and attempt to avoid your enemies attacks in real-time. Additionally you can now summon creatures and control them in all battles to take advantage of their enhanced abilities.",
