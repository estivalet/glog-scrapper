  "description": "<i>An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush</i> is a side scrolling Jump'n Run featuring Fievel, the little mouse from the movie <i>An American Tail</i>. It features six graphically different worlds with four levels each. Each world is completed by defeating a boss monster.<br><br>While the background story asks for finding six pieces of the lost map to a goldmine (hence the six worlds), the basic task is to collect gold for points and extra lives. The gold also works as an indicator to see how much of a level has actually been explored. Fievel can jump on enemies and throw his hat in a boomerang fashion.",
