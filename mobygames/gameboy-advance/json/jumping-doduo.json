  "description": "You're a fun loving Doduo out for a run, so you're not going to let those other Pokémon get in your way. In this game a single player playing as a Doduo uses either the A or B button to jump over Bellsprout, Bulbasaur, Dugtrio, Donphan, Sudowoodo and boulders. <br><br>The goal is to see how long the player can last before touching one of these creatures; some are easier to hit than others. Once the player has touched any of them, the game is over and the poor Doduo will cry in shame.<br><br>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokémon-e Aquapolis cards Doduo (73/147) and Dodrio (46/147), or in Japan Pokémon e-card expansion 3 cards Doduo (61/87) and Dodrio (62/87).",
