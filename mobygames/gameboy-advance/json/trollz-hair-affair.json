  "description": "<i>Trollz: Hair Affair!</i> is a minigame compilation based on the animated television series produced by DIC Entertainment Corporation. It features five teenage &quot;trollz&quot;, Amethyst, Ruby, Sapphire, Topaz, and Onyx, who manage their day-to-day high school lives with the help of their magic. Each character is tied to a different minigame: Topaz has &quot;Watch the Hair&quot;, in which she shrinks down and climbs through her friends' hair to untangle knots while dodging frizzies and Snarf; Sapphire has Smarty Trollz, a memory-matching game; Ruby has Trollz Dance, a rhythm game; Amethyst has Flying Spell, an aerial sidescroller that also involves shooting enemies while managing the skoot's energy; and Onyx has Spell Beadz, a Puzzle Bobble clone. Each minigame also features collectible power-ups, with each one doing something different depending on the game. The gameplay is affected by the difficulty setting chosen at the beginning of the game (easy, medium, or hard).In the story mode, these minigames are played in between short cutscenes.",
