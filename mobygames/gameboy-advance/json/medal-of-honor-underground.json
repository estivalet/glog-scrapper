  "description": "The game is a prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Medal+of+Honor\">Medal of Honor</a> and it is set in the early stages of WWII. You play as Manon Batiste, who briefed the missions for you in the original Medal of Honor. She is a new member of a small band of French rebels who fight against the tyranny of the Germans.<br><br>There are 7 missions in total, featuring 12 different historical weapons. There are NPCs helping you out by cracking safes and driving. Not all enemies are on foot; expect to face tanks and bikes amongst other things. Enemy AI is responsive and sometimes surprising.",
