  "description": "Released as the handheld companion to the 3D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/bionicle\">BIONICLE</a>, this game obviously has different gameplay, such as the lack of a save feature, using passwords instead, and a limited number of lives, after which the game resets. An improvement is that all versions of the Toa, including Toa, Toa Nuva, and Takanuva, are playable. Some basic story elements are kept the same, however.<br><br>A set number of Matoran have to be rescued in a level so that they can help the Turaga construct a key to the boss room. Players use their Elemental powers to fight enemies, but their powers are limited. Once their meter runs out, they have to find a power-up. Rescued Matoran are taken back to a shrine near the beginning of the stage. Platforming is also involved, as moving platforms, falling platforms, cliffs, and jumping are included.",
