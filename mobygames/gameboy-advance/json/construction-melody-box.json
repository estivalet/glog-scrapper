  "description": "<i>Construction: Melody Box</i> is a Pokémon-themed e-Reader application. It involves playing a variety of different musical tracks in different ways. The data for this application is found on a great variety of cards. Only one card is technically required to play this game, but the idea is to try as many as possible. There are three types of cards: sound cards, which change the sound or instrument, music cards, which provide a musical piece, and pattern cards, which provide a sort of &quot;wallpaper&quot; for the application. The player can use any combination of these, including having just one type of card. Using all three, however, provides the full experience. For example, one combination of cards features Chikorita singing Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 with a Charmender pattern, and another could be a church organ playing Team Rocket's theme from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-gold-version\">Pokémon Gold</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-silver-version\">Silver</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-crystal-version\">Crystal</a> to a Hoppip pattern. Scanning only a pattern card always results in the same tune, and scanning a sound card without a music card plays this same tune in whatever sound is selected. While listening to the music, a Clefairy is shown on screen using Metrenome. The player can move this Clefairy using the D-pad. Moving it left and right slows and speeds up the music, respectively, and moving it up and down increases and decreases the pitch, respectively. Cards for this game can be found in the Expedition Base Set, Aquapolis expansion, Skyridge expansion, McDonald's Original Minimum?Pack, and various promotional cards.",
