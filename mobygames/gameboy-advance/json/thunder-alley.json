  "description": "<i>Thunder Alley</i> is a racing game for the Game Boy Advance where the player takes control of stock-cars.<br><br>The game is played from a third person perspective and uses <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Sennari+Interactive\">Sennari Interactive's</a> ray tracing engine from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Game+Boy+Advance\">Driver 2</a>. The cast of the game are all characters from the <i>Tin Pin Alley</i> series of bowling games.<br><br>There are two game modes: Practice Race, where the player may practice laps; and Tournament Race, where the player competes against AI-controlled drivers. Throughout the game's tracks, the player will come across power ups that boosts the speed of the player car and obstacles that hinder it like for example oil which causes the car to spin around. There are four different tracks in the game, each with its own layout and appearance, although the difference between them is very small.",
