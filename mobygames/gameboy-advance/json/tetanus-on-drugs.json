  "description": "This freeware, unlicensed <i>Tetris</i> clone is a lighthearted take on what it might be like to play the famous game while under the influence of mind-altering substances. It keeps the main gameplay of <i>Tetris</i> relatively unchanged, but ramps up the difficulty with a playing field that constantly zooms in and out and sways side to side.",
