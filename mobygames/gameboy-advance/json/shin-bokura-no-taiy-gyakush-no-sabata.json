  "description": "<i>Shin Bokura no Taiy? Gyakush? no Sabata</i> is the third episode in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Boktai+series\">Boktai series</a> and the only one not released outside Japan. The story takes place directly after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/boktai-2-solar-boy-django\">Boktai 2</a>. Sealed up by the Lunar family long ago the ancient being Vanargand has been awakened and is now attempting to use Django's old acquaintance Sabata for his evil schemes. It is once again up to Django to clean up this mess, in order to achieve one of  four possible endings.<br><br>As in its two predecessors the striking feature is once again the solar sensor that is implemented in the cartridge. Its main purpose is to use sunlight as ammo for the solar gun &quot;Gun del Sol&quot;, making its comeback from the first game. Gameplay changes depending on if the game is played in the sun and how intense the sunlight is. For example, water disappears, light shines through the ceiling of dungeons or hidden passages become visible once the solar sensor detects sunlight.<br><br>Aside for the aforementioned sunlight elements, the gameplay consists mainly of classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Zelda+series\">Zelda</a>-like puzzle solving and a few stealth-action elements. For the first time in the series the game includes arcade-like driving sequences on a motorbike, which can be upgraded with various parts, improving its performance. By frequently hitting enemies the Trance gauge can be filled, allowing the player to transform into either Sol Django or Black Django, giving him special attacks. The motorbike mini-game can be played competitively with two players.",
