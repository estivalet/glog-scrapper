  "description": "In this Pokémon e-Reader game you control Wooper as it juggles other Pokémon using its Water Gun attack. You gain points by hitting Pokémon with Water gun at very close range, sending them flying. At first, you start only juggling Poliwag and Totodile, but after gaining 3000 points Psyduck jumps in. Psyduck requires two blasts to send flying, while Poliwag falls faster than Totodile. Be careful not to let anyone touch the ground, or the game will end. The cards were part of the McDonald's Original Minimum?Pack, a 30-card pack distributed in McDonald's Happy Meals in Japan from January 26 to February 24, 2002. The required cards are Chinchou, Mareep, Totodile and Marill.",
