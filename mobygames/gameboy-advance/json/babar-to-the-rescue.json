  "description": "<i>Babar To The Rescue</i> is a game based around Babar the Elephant, a character from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Jean+de+Brunhoff\">Jean de Brunhoff's</a> children's books. It consists of a series of nine levels played in a fixed order. There are three types of gameplay and these are repeated with some variations. The included levels are:<ul>\n<li>Balloon Ride: control Babar in a hot air balloon in a 2D side-scrolling environment. Collect crowns and avoid obstacles and enemies to make it to the children.</li><br>\n<li>Across the Rivers: a side-scrolling platform game where Babar needs to make it past water sections, using platforms, swinging with vines and collecting crowns.</li><br>\n<li>Jungle Rally: a top-down, vertically scrolling racing game where Babar needs to collect crows and avoid obstacles. There are also ramps that can be used. The car is steered and can be sped up or down.</li><br>\n<li>The Savannah: similar to Across the Rivers but now in a savannah that is on fire.</li><br>\n<li>Down the River: similar to Jungle Rally but now on a river controlling a speedboat.</li><br>\n<li>In the Snow: similar to Across the Rivers and The Savannah, but now in a frozen environment.</li><br>\n<li>Motorcycle Rally: similar to the previous two racing sections, but now on a motorcycle.</li><br>\n<li>Off to the Island: the platforming mini-game, but with a new setting and with the ability to swim and explore underwater. Babar needs to go back to the surface regularly to fill his oxygen meters or his points are drained.</li><br>\n<li>Going Home: a variation of the first Balloon Ride level as Babar needs to get back home.</li></ul>There are short story sequences between levels shown as static images and overall progresses through the levels is shown on a map. The game emphasizes the score a lot and keeps track of the highscore.",
