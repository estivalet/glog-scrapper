  "description": "Midway's arcade hockey series makes its only appearance on the Game Boy Advance with <i>NHL Hitz 20-03</i>. Adhering to the arcade style, matches are three-on-three (plus goalies), there are hardly any penalties and fights happen regularly.<br><br>Game modes include exhibition games, a full season (of 29, 58 or 82 games) and playoffs (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7). Season progress is stored to battery-backed RAM. A multiplayer mode via link cable for up to four players is also available. Before a match, players select their lineup from the star players of the included NHL teams.<br><br>Gameplay is seen from an elevated horizontally scrolling view. Controls allow for stick and body checks and dekes. As is standard in Midway arcade sports games, each player has a turbo meter that allows the toggling of turbo, which enhances the other moves. Additionally, players can &quot;catch on fire&quot; after a hat trick or a sequence of successful checks, which increases their abilities for a short time.<br><br>The game features voice sample commentary from long-time Midway announcer Tim Kitzrow.",
