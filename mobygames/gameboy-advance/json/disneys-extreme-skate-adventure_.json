The Game Boy Advance version moves to an isometric viewpoint, using the engine of the portable <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4__\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</a>.<br><br>Three worlds are included: Toy Story, Tarzan, and The Lion King, each with two levels and a boss fight. In the story mode, each level has 3 runs, each one unlocking more of the level. Characters are scattered around the level, and will give missions, for example making a difficult jump, or collecting items within a time limit. There are also time challenge (most points inside a time limit), trick challenge (match tricks), and turbo challenge (match kinds of tricks fast) modes for each level, along with a tutorial and versus mode. In versus mode, two players take turns (hot-seat) getting the best trick possible.",
