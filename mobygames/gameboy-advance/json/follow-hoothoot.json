  "description": "In this game a young Hoothoot, one legged owl, will learn to dance from his hoary Hoothoot dance instructor. The instructor believes the best method is for you to copy exactly what does, get it wrong to many times and he'll storm off, class over.<br><br>You'll have to mimic the moves of the professor using the directional pad and the A and B buttons to perform special moves. Dance your way to the highest score you can!<br><br>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokémon-e Skyridge cards Hoot-Hoot (65/144),  Sunflora (105/144), Venonat (112/144), Weedle (114/144).
