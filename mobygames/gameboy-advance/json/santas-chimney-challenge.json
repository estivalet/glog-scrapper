  "description": "It's Christmas Eve and Santa is delivering presents. Unfortunately, due to him eating too many free cookies, Rudolph is unable to maintain height and Santa must now shorten the chimneys by dropping presents on them. <br><br><i>Santa's Chimney Challenge!</i> is similar to the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/canyon-bomber\">Canyon Bomber</a>. Santa rides his sleigh across the screen, dropping down with each pass (except for the first level). You must drop presents down the chimneys below to flatten them before Rudolph crashes into them. More than one present can be dropped at a time. There are four levels to complete.<br><br>The GBA version was an entry into the 2005 Drunken Coders Xmas Coding Competition and ported to the ZX Spectrum Next in 2019.",
