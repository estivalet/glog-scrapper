  "description": "<i>Cabbage Patch Kids: The Patch Puppy Rescue</i> is a platform game for the Game Boy Advance. You begin the game by selecting one of several Kids to control, each with their own name and appearance. The goal is to reach the end of several sets of platforming levels &amp; talk to the friend or puppy at the end. The gameplay is simple and there is no way to die or take damage, though there are occasional enemies who will knock you back if you touch them. There are also three minigames to play through in-between stages. After beating all the stages, you can revisit each level to collect all the gems and try for a 100% file.",
