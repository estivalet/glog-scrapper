  "description": "In this portable installment of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Activision%27s\">Activision's</a> long standing <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Cabela%27s+Big+Game+Hunter\">hunting simulation series</a> players start a game by customizing a character, selecting age, hair, and snazzy hunting couture, as well as hunting skills, such as aiming, accuracy, strength, and stealth. Then they set out on an hunting adventure, with a view to pot a grizzly bear or wildest moose. Two modes are available a &quot;Quick Hunt&quot; and a &quot;Career Hunt&quot;. Fear not, the later is hardly social commentary, rather it is a goal oriented story mode, while the former will allow the player to select one of the various breath taking North American hunting and persecute the local fauna to their heart's content. The story mode revolves around allowing the player's grizzled uncle &quot;Pete&quot; live vicariously through the them by accomplishing Pete's dream of entering the Hunter's Hall of Fame. Hunters wishing to achieve such fame must slay one animal in each of the 65 hunting regions in the country. Poor Pete was three kills shy of bloodsport immortalization, then he broke his leg... The player must accomplish the entire task, for Pete's sake.<br><br>Gameplay consists of selecting a region to go hunting in and then wandering about looking for the correct animal in your bestiary to knock off. In Alaska for instance the player may be tasked with gunning down a moose. During the aimless wandering and Promethean loneliness sections of the game the player will have time to select the proper guns and ammo for their quarry as well as apply various lures and fatally seductive moose (etc.) mating cries. When the animal sought is kind enough to appear, at the end of a long trail of tracks, the player may whip out their rifle going into a first person, crosshair-grafted-directly-to-the-eye style, mode. When the player is content with a corpse it will be weighed and the level will end, until they choose to return to try and bag a heftier score. <br><br>Being sentimental the game provides the player with trophies of their kills in the form of taxidermied animal heads for which a rustic and picturesque log cabin has graciously been provided.
