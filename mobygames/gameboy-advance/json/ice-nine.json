  "description": "<i>Ice Nine</i> is a first person shooter where player assumes a role of newly-enlisted CIA operative. The game starts at Langley with a series of training missions: target practice and live exercise with marker pellets instead of real bullets, where you need to mark your fellow operatives in a real urban area. However that training ends on a sour note as you learn that one of your colleagues could possibly be a mole that tries to leak and sell a deadly computer virus called Ice Nine. Since there's no hard proof it becomes your new mission to infiltrate CIA and find it - not without help from your chief.<br><br>The game is using 3D-engine similar to <i>Doom</i> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=dark+forces\">Dark Forces</a> - it can display some simple texture mapped 3D architecture, has variable level height, ladders, elevators, but the characters are sprite-based and there's no free look. Many objects on levels could be destroyed or at least damaged. The game is majorly run'n'gun exercise where doors are opened automatically to not slow down the action and most of the goals include finding keys or objects and eliminating all of the opposition, however in several missions the CIA agent must avoid security cameras and use night vision to move in the dark.<br><br>There are 18 missions, but some of the locations are reused throughout the game. <i>Ice Nine</i> arsenal offers a standard FPS set that has everything from a handgun to rocket launcher, also there's a sniper rifle that can be used with a zoom feature.\n",
