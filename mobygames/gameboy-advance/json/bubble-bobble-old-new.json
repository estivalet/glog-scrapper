Either tough it out on your own, or get a friend's help by playing either single-cart or multi-cart multiplayer!  To defeat enemies, simply trap them in bubbles that you blow, then pop the bubbles with your dinosaur's spines!<br><br>Bubble Bobble: Old &amp; New includes both the classic arcade version, and an all-new version, with updated graphics and sound.  Also included is battery back-up to save your progress, as well as an item library, which keeps track of all the goodies you've collected in the game.",
