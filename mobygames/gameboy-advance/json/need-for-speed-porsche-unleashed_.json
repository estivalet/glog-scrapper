  "description": "Years after versions for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/need-for-speed-porsche-unleashed\">PC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/need-for-speed-porsche-unleashed\">console</a>, Electronic Arts' racing game licensed from German sports car manufacturer Porsche AG received an adaptation for the Game Boy Advance, with much simplified options and modes, and graphics and tracks adapted to the capabilities of the handheld platform.<br><br>The game's main mode is Evolution mode. As in the PC and console versions, this mode takes players through the history of Porsche cars from the 1950's 356 to the 1990's GT1, but without any of the economy or customization options. All in all, there are 25 different models available to drive. Evolution mode consists of 15 events, which have to be won in order. Earlier events are single races, later ones include multiple races in a tournament. All are races against 4 opponents, with winning necessary to go to the next event. Each new event unlocks new cars that can also be used in the game's other modes. These include a single player mode that offers quick races as well as knockout (last car after a race is removed) and quick knockout (last car after a lap is removed) races. A multiplayer mode offers races for up to four players via link cable.<br><br>The game includes five different tracks, each with forward and reverse directions and dry, rain and snow weather options. The graphics engine is the same as used in developer Pocketeers earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/need-for-speed-underground_\">NFS Underground</a>, with cars and tracks modeled in texture-mapped 3D. 1st-person cockpit and 3rd-person behind-the-car views are available. Actual racing has a heavy arcade focus, with braking to get around corners rarely necessary since bumping into the road usually only deducts a few kph from the current speed.",
