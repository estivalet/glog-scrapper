  "description": "<i>Madden NFL 2004</i> is Budcat Creations' third and last contribution to the series on the Game Boy Advance and differs very little from its immediate predecessors.<br><br>All the features from the 2003 edition are included: exhibition, season and playoff modes, 4-player multiplay via the link cable, player trades, and the create-a-player mode featuring training mini games.<br><br>The graphics engine used is also the same, but the viewing angle has been adjusted for a better overview of the field. Team and player stats are updated for the 2003 NFL season, and the game again features commentary by John Madden and Al Michaels. An entirely new feature is connectivity to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gamecube/madden-nfl-2004\">GameCube</a> version of the game, which can be used to unlock bonuses in the console title.",
