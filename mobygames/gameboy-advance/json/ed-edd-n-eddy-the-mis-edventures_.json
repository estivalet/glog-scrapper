  "description": "<i>Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures</i> is a 2-D side scrolling platformer. The game follows the Ed's quest to obtain as many jawbreakers as possible, which can either be found in the game world or purchased from candy machines for $1 accumulated from collecting pennies. The game features six distinct areas to explore and retains much of the art style and humor found in the TV show. Enemies encountered include dogs, squirrels, birds, and even water sprinklers and garden rakes. Characters from the show such as Kevin, Rolf, and the Kanker Sisters also make an appearance.",
