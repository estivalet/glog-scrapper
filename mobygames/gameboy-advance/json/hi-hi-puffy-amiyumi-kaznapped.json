  "description": "It's been a long world tour for Puffy AmiYumi, one of Japan's best rock groups. All they want to do is take a breather, but Harmony, the girls' number one fan, won't let them. When Ami and Yumi refuse to cater to Harmony's whim, the crazed blonde takes matters into her own hands - by stealing their diminutive manager Kaz and their instruments! Now Ami and Yumi must use their wits - and what's left of their music - to recover their instruments, find Harmony and rescue Kaz. Without any of them, Puffy AmiYumi may be doomed!<br><br><i>Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi: Kaznapped</i> is a single-player platformer based on the Cartoon Network series &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot;. Controlling and using Ami and Yumi's unique abilities (Ami can sing and swing, while Yumi plays guitar and lifts heavy objects), the player battles through six worlds of three areas each (with another world revealed when the game is complete). Along their way Ami and Yumi will encounter a series of puzzles which only a certain skill can solve, Kaz-bots created by Harmony, and other Puffy fans who just want a piece of the girls. Kaz-bots can be attacked, but fans can only be temporarily distracted (if they get attacked, the girls will lose points). Thankfully, Ami and Yumi can gain an advantage by petting their cats Jang Keng (to regain lost health) or Tekirai (for an extra life).<br><br>As Ami and Yumi progress in their adventure, they can also unlock mini-games, costumes, and other goodies for the player to enjoy.",
