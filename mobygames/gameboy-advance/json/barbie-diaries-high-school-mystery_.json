  "description": "<i>The Barbie Diaries: High School Mystery</i> is a game based on the 2006 movie <i>The Barbie Diaries</i>. The game is set in Barbie's high school where valuable items for the high school charity auction have gone missing. By locating these Barbie cannot only help the school, but it will also help her land the TV anchor position currently held by Raquelle, a girl she does not like.<br><br>The game is largely played as an adventure game where Barbie explores the environment, talks to characters and uses a large variety of tech tools to locate and inspect clues. All available tools are accessible through the BDA (Barbie Diary Assistant). Examples are an Infrared Viewer, an MP3 Decoder or a Picture Descrambler. There are nineteen locations in total to explore with a map that provides an overview. The clues are stored in a separate screen and there is also an overview of the current objectives. The sequences where the tech tools are used are also available as mini-games at the main menu.",
