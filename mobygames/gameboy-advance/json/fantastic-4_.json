  "description": "<i>Fantastic 4</i> is based on the 2005 film of the same name starring Marvel's classic superheroes. It adapts the film in the form of a beat'em up/brawler seen from an isometric perspective. The player controls the Fantastic Four (usually only two, but sometimes all four at the same time) and can switch between them at will, with each of the heroes having different attacks they use to fight minions and boss enemies. The Four also have distinct special abilities that are utilized for slight puzzle elements, with a color-coded prompt usually indicating which hero's power is necessary to overcome an obstacle. Besides Dr. Doom (the main villain of the film), the game includes additional storylines featuring other villains from the comics.",
