  "description": "A new theme park is about to be opened by Uncle Scrooge, until Dr. Nickel arrives on the scene, taking over the power systems and scattering magic power all over the park. In order for the park to be opened, it's up to Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy to find the magical power and return the park back to the way it was.<br><br>In order to do this, the gang must move along the game board and complete various challenges. Game length can be set between one and four days (i.e. boards to complete). Players take turns to roll the dice and move their character. Landing on blue spaces adds magical power, while red spaces remove it. Green spaces are special and might contain one-time use items (like double dice or six- or twelve-space move cards), allow one to warp to another space, roll again, force skipping a turn, turn blue into red spaces, et cetera. One particular park attraction is always the current goal. The player who reaches it first is awarded magical power, a crystal and must then complete a side-scrolling platform challenge, beating or avoiding enemies and collecting stars, all while looking for the exit before time runs out. Completing an attraction awards the player with more magical power (depending on the number of stars collected) and possibly a pet. Pets can also be bought in store spaces by trading in crystals. Pets increase magical power, and each pet has a unique power that can be used by its owner, like increasing movement rate. <br><br>A board is completed after 12 turns. The player that collected the most power is declared the day's winner. When all boards in the game are done, a boss battle follows. If more than one players play, the one with the most collected power overall fights the boss.<br><br>There are four different boards, each with their own theme. Up to four players can play the main game using one GBA, or play with four linked handhelds to challenge each other in a set of unlockable mini-games. The side-scrolling attraction levels can also be unlocked for play from the main menu.",
