  "description": "<i>All Grown Up!: Express Yourself</i> is based on the successor of the Rugrats show. In this game, players take control of Angelica, who is running the school newspaper.<br><br>Each story that she is working on is considered as a mission. Players will need to complete 8 missions in total.<br><br>The Story Chase mode's gameplay involves finding the right character to talk to and sometimes finding and giving them specific items and playing mini-games to progress through the game. The mini-games that players complete in the story chase can then be played separately. Completing a mission awards players with a copy of the Class Paper.<br><br>There are additional options in the game such as choosing which accessories Angelica will wear as well as switching the background music, image and character seen and heard in the menu, a PDA where players can make their own To Do lists, fill in personal details about them and their friends or take a quiz to find out which character from the TV series they resemble the most.",
