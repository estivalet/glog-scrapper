  "description": "In this portable version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Winning+Eleven\">Winning Eleven/Pro Evolution Soccer</a> series the player can choose among 44 national teams (plus a few unlockable ones) and 16 club teams in Master League mode.<br><br>The game plays (and given the limitations, feels) like the PSOne versions of the series. Gameplay has been tweaked to allow playing with only four buttons, making some actions such as lobbing only accessible through double taps on the passing button, yet it retains the attention to ball movement and focus on accurate passing of the &quot;big&quot; versions. Graphically, player sprites are like their polygonal models, with a lot of similar movements.<br><br>Game modes include Friendly, League mode, Cup (European Championships, Copa America, CAN, Asian Cup and custom), World Tournament and Master League.
