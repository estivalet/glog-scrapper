  "description": "<em>ZooCube</em> is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points.<br><br>The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tetris+licensees\">Tetris</a> the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.",
