  "description": "&quot;Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan&quot; is a unique commodities trading game for the GameBoy Advance. Set against the backdrop of the 1840's Opium Wars between Britain and China, the player must command a trading ship and sail dangerous seaways across the world in order to find, purchase and sell exotic goods for the best price. The prize: a trading empire dominating the globe. The addictive gameplay of &quot;Sea Trader&quot; hearkens back to classic trading games such as &quot;Taipan&quot; and &quot;Dope Wars&quot;, but has much improved graphics and is more action-oriented and engaging.
