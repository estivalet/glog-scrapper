After hundreds of years of rebuilding, that same civilisation is again under attack from the dragon, and only the Shining Fleet know of a way to destroy it and save the people. \nA combination of adventure and RPG, Shining Soul will have you building a team of warriors from different character classes and travel the world in search of the dragon, defeating the evil that awaits you on your path. Characters gain experience between battles, improving their health and power, while new weapons and armor can be collected.",
