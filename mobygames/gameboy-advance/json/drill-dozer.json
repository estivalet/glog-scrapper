Using your Drill Dozer, you must lead your fellow band of thieves, the Red Dozers, on a quest to retrieve the Red Diamond. <br><br>Gameplay consists of navigating through several areas using your Drill Dozer robot to bore through enemies, walls, and pretty much anything else that's in your way. The Drill Dozer itself is a multifaceted machine able to work underwater and to take flight. It also has the ability to shift the drill into higher gears to tear through the toughest of obstacles. Along the way, you'll upgrade your Drill Dozer robot with gears and add-ons that will help aide you in your quest.",
