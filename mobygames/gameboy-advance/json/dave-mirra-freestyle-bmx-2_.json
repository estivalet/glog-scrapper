  "description": "<i>Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2</i>, the first game in the series on the Game Boy Advance, is an extreme sports game following the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tony+Hawk%27s+Pro+Skater\">Tony Hawk</a> template.<br><br>The game features 12 professional BMX riders to choose from, each with their own statistics in speed, spin, balance, bunnyhop, air, and hangtime. Five different selectable bikes augment these stats further.<br><br>The game's main mode is called &quot;Proquest&quot;. In each level, a variety of goals and challenges must be met within a time limit, netting experience points. These points can be used to increase the rider's stats and they unlock further levels. Challenges include reaching certain high scores, collecting letters and spray cans, and performing specific tricks. Completing the first levels switches the game to Pro, and later, Hardcore mode, increasing the difficulty of the goals in each stage. <br><br>All of the six levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half and quarter pipes, ramps, bowls, rails and special objects (a truck, a fountain, a row of boxes) to perform tricks on. Tricks are activated through button combinations. Completing several tricks in a row without bailing increases the rush meter - when filled, it allows the performance of signature moves for each rider.<br><br>Two further modes are &quot;Session&quot; and &quot;Freeride&quot; - they allow practicing unlocked levels either with or without the time limit.<br><br>Two two-player modes utilizing a single GBA (the players take turns) are also available: In &quot;Full Run&quot;, the two players compete for a high score, in &quot;Star Collector&quot; they compete for a best time in finding 10 stars scattered over the levels.",
