  "description": "<i>Fruits Daisakusen!</i> is a Pokémon-themed e-Reader application. In the game, Totodile is swimming across a stretch of Tentacruel-infested waters. Its goal is to collect as many pieces of fruit as possible before crossing the finish line at the end, and also to avoid physical contact with the Tentacruel. Using the directional pad allows Totodile to move left and right, while pressing the A button causes it to swimm faster and head to the top of the screen. If Totodile touches a Tentacruel, it is stung, and temporarily becomes immobile. For a few seconds afterward, it flashes and is invincible. Each type of fruit is worth a different amount of points: banana bunches are worth 300, apples are worth 600, melons are worth 1000, and watermelon halves are worth 5000. The entire length of the water is 100 meters. There is a &quot;timer&quot; in the bottom left corner of the screen that shows how many meters are left. To play <i>Fruits Daisakusen!</i>, the player needs the following cards from the super-rare Theater Limited VS Pack, which was only distributed in Japanese movie theaters showing <i>Pokémon Heroes</i>: Misty's Politoed, Misty's Corsola and Ross's Wailmer.",
