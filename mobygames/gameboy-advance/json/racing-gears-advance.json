  "description": "This handheld racing game offers a range of 12 licensed cars (including models by Chevrolet, Dodge, GM, Lotus and Mitsubishi), several circuits, and a set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.<br><br>With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose  Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by achieving a good placement or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and, if possible, upgrade your car. Upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).<br><br>The track design uses isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.",
