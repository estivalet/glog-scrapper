  "description": "The Associated Nexus of Galaxies (TANG) has been invaded by monsters that are going after the energy crystals. The only hope of the TANG to get the situation back to normal is to call upon four superheroes known as the Tangibles.<br><br>Tang Tang is a puzzle/action game quite similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/solomons-key\">Solomon's Key</a>. You control one of the four superheroes who have the ability to create and destroy blocks as well as shoot laser beams. The goal of each level is to collect all the energy crystals scattered around while avoiding the enemies. Once all the energy crystals have been collected, a door to the next level opens. Every five levels, you will have to fight against a boss.<br><br>The game boasts 120 levels although it really is 30 levels, each with four different enemy positions.",
