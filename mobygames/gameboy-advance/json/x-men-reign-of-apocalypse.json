  "description": "Pulled into an alternate dimension, the X-Men soon discover that their larger-than-life rival, Apocalypse, rules the planet. The only way to get home is to fight their way through the many enemies under his rule to the Warp Gate.<br><br><i>X-Men: Reign of Apocalypse</i> plays mostly as a traditional side-scrolling beat-'em-up, the characters executing punches, throws, and special attacks. The player has four X-Men to work with - Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm and Rogue. More characters gradually become available to use as they are unlocked during play. The player earns special points that can be used to enhance the characters' strength, vitality, and mutant power capabilities. A constantly growing power meter allows the heroes to unleash devastating mutant attacks than can kill several enemies at once.<br><br>The game includes two-player simultaneous gameplay mode; the player can also take on three friends in the Versus modes, including Capture the Flag and Deathmatch options.
