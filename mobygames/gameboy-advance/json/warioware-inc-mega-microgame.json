  "description": "Tired of chasing after rival Mario and counting his millions again, Wario has put his spare time to good use to create his own video game, <i>WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</i>.<br><br>Simply put, <i>WarioWare</i> has you testing your skills in a huge collection of games from almost every genre you can think of. Each game lasts only a matter of seconds, but within that time you have to complete the task. This ranges from hitting a home run, stomping a handful of bad guys, winning a boxing match, solving a puzzle and winning the points.<br><br>You'll witness a wide selection of game graphics as well. Games originate from the original Nintendo Game &amp; Watch series, to the green tinted Game Boy titles and the modern day Game Boy Advance style. You'll also notice some well known names, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496630348\">Metroid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496630027\">Duck Hunt</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496630140\">Mario Bros.</a> series and much more hidden away between each mini game.",
