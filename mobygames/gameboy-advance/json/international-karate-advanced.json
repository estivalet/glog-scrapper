  "description": "<i>International Karate Advanced</i> is a remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/international-karate-2000\">International Karate 2000</a>, with the three-way free-for-all from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/chop-n-drop\">Internation Karate +</a> rather than the standard one-on-one from the other games in the series. The game features the same twelve playable characters, but now their skills are displayed on a scale of one to five stars. The same classic bonus games from the previous games have returned, as well as a practice dojo, which was previously included in <i>International Karate 2000</i>.",
