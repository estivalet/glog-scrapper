  "description": "As the peace in the kingdom of Fantasinia crumbles, invaders from the Bronquian Empire occupy the country. The only remaining survivor of the royal lineage, princess Yggdra Yuril Artwaltz, flees the Paltina Castle, carrying with her the most precious family heirloom, the sword Gran Centurio. The princess must now seek alliance with other rulers, with the eventual objective of reclaiming her homeland. Yggdra firmly believes than her holy sword represents the ultimate justice - but how far is she willing to go to attain her goals?<br><br><i>Yggdra Union: We'll Never Fight Alone</i> is a tactical role-playing game. Like most games of its kind, it is composed entirely of a string of large-scale strategic battles, interspersed by cutscenes that advance the storyline. Player-controlled and enemy units move in turn-based fashion over a battle field, the movement range represented as grids.<br><br>The game's distinguishing characteristic are its &quot;union&quot;-based battle mechanics. Unions are formations the player must construct in order to fight effectively, usually consisting of multiple units. Each unit, in its turn, comprises a leader and up to seven members. Each unit has a weapon affinity, with strengths and weaknesses distributed in a rock-paper-scissors fashion, and individual statistics. <br><br>Some of the battle conditions are influenced by the player's choice of a card, available before each battle. The cards vary in parameters and assigned skills, which influences the procedure and eventually the outcome of the upcoming battle. Special modes called Aggression and Rage can be activated during the battle; the exact effect of these depends on the skills assigned to the card chosen by the player.",
