  "description": "In this adaptation of the animated film Kong: King of Atlantis, you play as Jason, Lua, and King Kong himself in a side-scrolling adventure platformer on a quest to stop the evil Queen Reptilla from Atlantis as she tries to use Kong for her own gain. <br><br>Players must fight with their fists and special moves to take down the tar monsters and snake men found on the island of Atlantis, all three characters playing in similar levels and similar ways even though two are human and one is a giant ape. With 15 short platforming levels to explore it isn't too long of an experience, with each level having a password in case the player wishes to continue play another time.",
