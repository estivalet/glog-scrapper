  "description": "In this third game starring Nancy Drew, the famous teen detective has to solve a mystery in a Victorian mansion in San Francisco. The villa seems to be inhabited by ghosts... but this is not all. Somewhere in this strange house lies a treasure. That's why she's not the only one interested in this mansion. Could it be the antique dealer, the handy-man, the retired teacher, the owner of the estate or someone else? Everyone has something to hide and Nancy must find out who is behind the strange happenings going on.<br><br>The game is a standard point-and-click adventure game that includes two difficulty choices (Junior and Senior Detective) and a <i>Second Chance</i> is offered to players who make a fatal mistake. There are a large number of puzzles to be solved, some of which are slightly different depending upon the difficulty level chosen. Setting the time of day in Nancy's bedroom is necessary for certain events to occur or the availability of some in-game characters.<br><br>Compared to the previous <i>Nancy Drew</i> games, <i>Message In The Haunted Mansion</i> underwent big changes in design. It is 360 degree with full motion freedom.",
