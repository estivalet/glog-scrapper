  "description": "<i>Animal Snap: Rescue Them 2 by 2</i> is a tile based puzzle game borrowing some elements from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=MahJong\">MahJong</a>. Players need to clear groups of stacked titles by selecting two identical tiles, thus removing them. As matches make tiles disappear, new ones below are uncovered. This process is repeated until all tiles and removed. Tiles are selected by moving the cursor around and then a button to confirm or remove a selection. The game can be played in an Arcade Mode and as a Time Challenge. The gameplay is identical for both modes, but in Arcade the goal is to complete levels in the fastest time possible, while in Time Challenge a timer counts down. The tiles contain objects, animals and letters that spell the word BONUS.",
