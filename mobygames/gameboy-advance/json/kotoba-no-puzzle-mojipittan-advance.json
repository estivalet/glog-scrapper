  "description": "<i>Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan Advance</i> is a Japanese word puzzle game. It is similar to the board game <i>Scrabble</i>, in which players play against the computer, placing tiles featuring language characters onto a grid to form words. Unilke <i>Scrabble</i>, however, a player can only place one tile per turn. Also unlike <i>Scrabble</i>, the tile can be placed anywhere on the board, next to tiles from multiple words, even if it is placed next to a tile that, when combined with it, would make a nonexistant word. As long as the placing of the tile forms at least one word, it is allowed.<br><br>The game uses hiragana as opposed to <i>Scrabble's</i> English alphabet.",
