Sent to the island of Ovis to investigate a series of unusual events, Alphonse begins to question his loyalty and purpose as a knight of Lodis, involving himself in a battle of epic proportions.<br><br><i>Tactics Ogre</i>'s gameplay is squad-based and turn-based, just like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/final-fantasy-tactics\">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, and, despite many RPG elements, the game almost entirely consists of combat.  Aside from the main campaign, <i>Tactics Ogre</i> also offers a vs mode and Quest mode, in which the player must complete objectives they set themselves within a certain number of turns to earn rare items that can be used in the campaign mode.  Finally, there is also an option to exchange characters and items between players with a link cable.",
