  "description": "In this game, the player takes control of a modern-day male teenager and his female best friend (the player gives them names in the beginning of the game). They have received a strange letter from an anonymous sender, and are about to discuss it during their meeting in a park, when they suddenly become unconscious... When the two wake up, they find themselves in a strange world, populated by characters from various works by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,355934/\"> Go Nagai</a>. At first, they meet Akira from <i>Devilman</i> and Cutey Honey from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=cutey+honey\"> eponymous manga</a>. At that point, the player can choose to follow either of them as the main protagonist; the best friend will then leave with the other character. The two stories have the same main events, and eventually lead to a grand confrontation that will decide the fate of that world.<br><br><i>Legend of Dynamic: G?sh?den - H?kai no Rondo</i> is a Japanese-style RPG, with wandering on the world map, party management, turn-based battles, simple leveling-up, and other typical features of the genre. The characters the player meets in the game are heroes featured in Go Nagai's stories, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=mazin\"> Mazinger Z</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=susano%c5%8d+desentsu\"> Susa no Oh</a>. The game features a so-called &quot;Assort System&quot;, which allows the player to team up characters and create combinations within the party. Active party members which participate in combat directly are called &quot;Battlers&quot;; their abilities can be enhanced in various ways by assigning &quot;partners&quot; to them, which play a more passive, supportive role, and can not take part in battles.",
