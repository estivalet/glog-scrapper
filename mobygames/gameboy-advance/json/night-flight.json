  "description": "You control a Zubat as it collects food in the night. The goal is to collect as much food as possible before running into a noxious <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/flower-power\">Koffing</a>, the bane of flying Pokémon it seems. What makes things sticky is that as it's so dark you can't see them! You are a bat though and will be able to use echolocation. Using Supersonic you'll shoot sound waves forward that will let you see upcoming obstacles.<br><br>The game scrolls to the left allowing you to fly around the screen that is available. The D-pad allows you to move around the screen and the A/B button will activate your Supersonic attack.<br><br>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Zubat (117/144) and Golbat (60/144). Or in Japan the Pokémon e-Card expansion 2 cards, Zubat (1/88) and Golbat (3/88).",
