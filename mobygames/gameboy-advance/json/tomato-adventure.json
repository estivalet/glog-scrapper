Disliking tomatoes in the Ketchup Kingdom is illegal, and the punishment for such people (referred to as &quot;Droppers&quot;) is being locked up until they do like tomatoes. DeMille's girlfriend, Patharan, also hates tomatoes, and she is kidnapped by King Ab?ra, leader of the Ketchup Kingdom. DeMille must go on a journey to save Patharan.<br><br><i>Tomato Adventure</i> is an action-command RPG. The player battles enemies when they bump into him on the screen. Battles are fought using Gimmicks, toy-like weapons. Using Gimmicks, the player must play a mini-game correctly in order to hit an enemy. Types of Gimmicks include Time, which require timing, Speed, which requires the player to finish a task before time runs out, Excite, which covers miscellaneous games, and Input, which requires the player to press buttons or enter information in a certain order. If the player fails a mini-game, they have to start all over.",
