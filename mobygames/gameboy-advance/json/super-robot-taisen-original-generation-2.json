  "description": "Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 is a strategy RPG in which players lead a small force of mechs in a fight to save humanity from an alien invasion. The designs of the mechs, pilots, and attacks are heavily influenced by anime. <br><br>The combat system of this game is similar to its predecessor. The player controls multiple mechs and issues commands in a turn-based fashion. Each mech pilot has &quot;spirit commands&quot; that can be used to strengthen a mechs abilities such as its hit or dodge rate. After moving a unit, the player is usually given the option to attack an enemy with an attack from a list. After all of the player's mechs have been moved, the AI gets a turn to move its mechs. If a player mech is attacked, the player has the option of counter-attacking, attempting to evade, or defending.<br><br>Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 does include a few minor changes to the battle system. For one thing, a new attack type (known as a chain attack) allows a unit to strike multiple enemies in a single blow. Also, the AI has been vastly improved.<br><br>The graphics of Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 have been enhanced from the graphics of the original. Attacks from mechs now have a more fluid motion and are generally more interesting to look at.<br><br>The game's story picks up six months after the original Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation left off. Most people on Earth are still trying to recover from the battle with the Aerogaters, but a small remaining faction of the Divine Crusaders is still trying to further their goals. Once again, it's up to the SRX and ATX teams of the EFA to put a stop to their activities and restore order. However, they are soon interupted by two new groups of mysterious enemies: the Einsts and the Inspectors.",
