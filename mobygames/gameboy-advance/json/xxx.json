  "description": "Xander Cage (also known as &quot;xXx’&quot;), an underground dweller and an extreme sports fanatic, has been recruited by the US National Security Administration as their next super-agent. After completing two tests set up by Agent Gibbons, Xander is set on a real mission. His target is Anarchy 99, the deadliest crime syndicate since the mafia took over New York. They've got biological weapons and a terrorist agenda; the new agent has got firepower and attitude to sabotage their stockpile of terrorist missiles, bombs and biochemical weaponry. <br><br>Based on the feature film of the same name, <i>xXx</i> is a side-scrolling shooter with extensive platform elements and driving levels. During the side-scrolling stages, Xander will deal with his enemies using a variety of firearms, such as AK-47, shotgun, and others; he can also use grenades for a more devastating effect. However, there are also many traps laid on his way, such as mines, trip wires, etc. Running and jumping on platforms is also a common activity in the game. Power-ups and health kits can be found to help the secret agent survive.<br><br>The driving levels play similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Road+Rash\">Road Rash</a>; Xander rides a bike, trying to avoid obstacles, and deals with his enemies by kicking them off their bikes, pushing them towards other cars and crashing them, etc.<br><br>        \n",
