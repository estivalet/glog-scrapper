  "description": "The pocket monsters are back on the pinball table, this time with the latest batch of creatures from the Ruby &amp; Sapphire series on GBA joining the already established cast of characters.<br><br>Your job is to not only use the Poke-ball as a pinball and rack up the biggest score on the table, but to also capture the Pokemon through a selection of mini-games and challenges during the usual pinball game. Simply hit the required areas of the board with the ball and you'll capture the monster available. There's 200 to find in total.<br><br>Two different boards are on offer, each based on the two versions of Pokemon for GBA (i.e. Ruby and Sapphire). Each board represents a new challenge as well as which Pokemon you can catch during play.<br><br>Although there is no 2 player battle mode of sorts, you can trade Pokemon and high scores using the link cable.",
