  "description": "In <i>Leek Game</i> you play a Farfetch'd protecting its crop of leeks from never-ending hordes of ravenously hungry Pokémon. You do this by whacking them in the head with your own leek. At the start, your leek patch is slowly attacked by a few Teddiursa. As time goes by, their attacks become more frequent. Soon, some Swinub join in on the attack. Swinub run even faster than Teddiursa, and are more cautious of the player's moves. The attacks just get faster as time marches on, and if the player allows the other Pokémon to stay at the leeks long enough, the patch starts shrinking. When the patch disappears, Farfetch'd is devastated and the player loses. The cards needed to play the game are the Skyridge Piloswine, Farfetch'd, Nidoran? and Swinub.",
