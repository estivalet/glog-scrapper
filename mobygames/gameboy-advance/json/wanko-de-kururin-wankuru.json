  "description": "<i>Wankuru</i> is a falling-block puzzle game that plays similarly to Sega's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/baku-baku-animal\">Baku Baku Animal</a>. Players drop pairs of puzzle blocks, which can be dogs, doghouses, or a mix of the two. The goal is to place long chains of dogs of the same colour, then place a doghouse of the same colour next to them so the whole chain can go home. Like other puzzle games, creating long chain reactions produces a major point reward. Like in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Puyo+Puyo+games\">Puyo Puyo series</a>, chain reactions rain garbage blocks down on the opponent's playfield; in this game, the garbage blocks are bones, and any dog eating a bone will refuse to enter a doghouse until they finish.<br><br>Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wankuru\">earlier Windows version</a>, there are both single-player and multiplayer modes. The main single-player game is a story mode which features some short visual novel-style scenes in between matches against the CPU. In this version the player is able to customize both their protagonist and their dog. The player can pick and name a female or male protagonist, and can also choose from one of a large number of dog breeds to name and customize. There is also a score attack mode, in which the player tries to get as far as possible through a set of 100 levels while racking up points. There is also a two-player mode which uses the Game Boy Advance's link cable.",
