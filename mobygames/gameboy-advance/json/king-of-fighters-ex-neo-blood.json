  "description": "Two years have now passed since the last edition of &quot;King of Fighters&quot; Tournament, accomplished in 1997: after Orochi was sealed by the joint forces of Kyo Kusanagi, Chizuru Kagura and Iori Yagami, all the fighters returned to their normal lives. But suddenly, a mysterious host decided to reopen the tournament and have been sent serial invitations to the most powerful fighters. But there are many secrets surrounding this happy-hour fighting clash, as the apparent disappearance of Iori Yagami and a remote distrust behind this unknown sponsor: that he would be using the championship to accomplish secret operations involving (maybe) the Orochi power...<br><br>This title marks the first installment of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=King+of+Fighters+Series\">King of Fighters Series</a> on Nintendo's 32-bit handheld. It brings a lot of gameplay characteristics based in both <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/king-of-fighters-evolution\">KOF Evolution</a> (most of the graphic stuff and principally both &quot;Striker&quot; System and backgrounds, now represented by a static 2D frame instead of the original 3D ones) and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/king-of-fighters-2000\">KOF 2000</a> (the musical repertoire).<br><br>Besides the traditional game modes (Team Play, Team Battle, Single Play, Single Battle, Endless Survival and Survival Time Attack), this game marks too the debut of a new-exclusive female character named Moe Habana.<br><br>With the permanence of 3 on 3 combats (plus Striker Attacks) and the introduction of a new female fighter, the main cast is composed by:<br><br><ul>\n<li><i>Hero Team:</i> Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido, Moe Habana and Shingo Yabuki</li><li><i>Fatal Fury Team:</i> Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Mai Shiranui and Joe Higashi</li><li><i>Art of Fighting Team:</i> Ryo Sakazaki, Robert Garcia, King and Yuri Sakazaki</li><li><i>Ikari Team:</i> Leona Heidern, Ralf Jones, Clark Steel and Whip</li><li><i>Psycho Soldier Team:</i> Athena Asamiya, Sie Kensou, Bao and Chin Gentsai</li><li><i>Korea Team:</i> Kim Kaphwan, Chang Koehan, Choi Bounge and Jhun Hoon</ul></li>\n</ul>",
