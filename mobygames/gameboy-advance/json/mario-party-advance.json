  "description": "The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite a bit on the GBA.  With the focus on the single-player, there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant single-player board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and gameplay modes to indulge in.<br><br>The main single-player experience involves traveling across &quot;Shroom City,&quot; which is a major departure from the standard set-up in past Mario Party titles.  You have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you choose, you'll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large.<br><br>You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special sections of the map, complete special quests, which often involve helping residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges.  Most quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game.  By completing these quests, you'll collect stars, which eventually allow for special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with.<br><br>The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although additional turns and die rolls can be earned during the game by completing the &quot;Mushroom Challenges&quot; that occur rather often.  After completing your session, your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in Play Mode.<br><br>There are also two additional modes available, &quot;Party Land,&quot; where you can play special duel mini-games with a friend, and &quot;Challenge Land,&quot; where you play through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop.<br><br>Finally, there is also a feature called the &quot;Bonus Board.&quot;  You can play with a board that is included with the game using the GBA.  The GBA takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.",
