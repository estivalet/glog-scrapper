  "description": "This spin-off entry in the <i>Wizardry</i> series has the player's party searching for a forbidden book of ancient power for the king through various randomly-generated dungeons. New to the series is the inclusion of the Summoner class, capable of capturing and summoning the various creatures the party comes across. Otherwise, the gameplay follows the traditional template of the series, including creation of a party of adventurers in the sole town, exploration of maze-like dungeons, and turn-based combat.",
