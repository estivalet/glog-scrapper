  "description": "Bomberman again teams up with Max to take on the evil Mujoe. But before they get the chance, Mujoe turns the tables, shrinking the heroes into tiny critters. Now the two must use their bombing powers and traverse the levels, blowing up obstacles and enemies to get to the exit, to eventually destroy the device and return themselves to normal size.<br><br>As with all previous <i>Bomberman</i> titles, the aim of the game is to plant bombs, destroying anything that comes within the range of the blast. Charabomb characters can be collected during play to increase your powers, or you battle and trade them with a friend in link mode.<br><br><i>Blue Advance</i> has you playing as Bomberman, and only when linking it with <i>Red Advance</i> you can access extra missions and collect all Charabombs. A classic 4-player Bomberman mode is also included.",
