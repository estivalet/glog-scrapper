  "description": "<i>Alienators: Evolution Continues</i> is a side-scrolling action game based on the animated TV show of the same name. The player takes the role of the captain of the Alienator team, Ira, and has to free a research lab from mutated creatures.<br><br>The twelve levels are not linear but mazes which have to be explored to reach the objectives; there is also a fair share of keycard hunting. The player defends his skin by shooting the aliens with his standard weapon (which has unlimited ammo), or with more powerful special weapons. Those have their unique ammo types, which have to be found during the course of the game - this means it is wise to save some ammo in case one of the eight bosses shows up. Of course additional characters from the TV series also make an appearance, either as friend or foe.",
