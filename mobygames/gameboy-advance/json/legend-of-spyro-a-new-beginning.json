  "description": "When the Dark Master attacked the sacred temple, the Fire Guardian, Ignitus, could only manage to save one of the dragon eggs from being destroyed.  This egg found its way to a family of dragonflies, who raised the newly hatched dragon as one of their own, along with their son Sparx.  The dragon, Spyro, soon discovered his heritage, and with Sparx, began on a quest to discover himself and eventually, save the world from the Dark Master's forces.<br><br><i>The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning</i> is a side-scrolling platformer based on the console game of the same name.  As Spyro, players can attack with melee attacks and charge tackles.  In addition to this, breath attacks are unlocked as players progress through the game, allowing Spyro to control the elements of fire, ice, earth and lightning.  The R Button will let Spyro fire a stream of breath, while the L Button will hurl a ranged attack at foes.  Finally, players can press L and R together when their purple Fury Meter is full to unleash a more powerful attack.<br><br><i>A New Beginning</i> also features mini-games such as a whack-a-mole style game, flying levels which play somewhat like a shooter in the vein of games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=013388110032\">1942</a>.  You'll even come across boss battles as you attempt to free the other Guardians from the evil dragon Cynder's forces.",
