  "description": "Through a range of different play modes (both single and multiplayer), you must clear the playfield of four different coloured block types (red, blue, green and yellow).<br><br>The gameplay is similar to the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=drop-mania\">Drop Mania</a>. A line of blocks sits above the play field which you can change the order of and drop two at a time onto the blocks below. Once a Detoblock (a block that is different in appearance to the usual blocks) appears, drop it onto the corresponding colour to clear those blocks from the field.<br><br>Play modes include Clear (clean the playfield of all blocks), Puzzle (try and clear all blocks within a set number of drops), Marathon (the usual play as far as you can mode) and Rescue Mode, where you must clear the blocks from the top of a cage, in which the many monsters from the arcade hit, Rampage World Tour, are trapped in.<br><br>2 player modes include Rescue (free the monster before the opponent to win), Score (score the most points in 1 minute) and Attack, in which the blocks you clear from your field appear on the opponents screen.",
