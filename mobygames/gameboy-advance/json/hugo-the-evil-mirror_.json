  "description": "This is a 2D version of a 3D PS1 &amp; PC game of the same name - <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=hugo-the-evil-mirror\">Hugo: The Evil Mirror</a>.<br><br>The backstory and gameplay ideas are the same as the 3D versions, but because of hardware limitations on the handheld consoles it was implemented as a 2D platform game.<br><br>Scylla as always, is envious of Hugolina's beauty, and want to capture her, but knows that Hugo will interfere, so she is looking for a way to eliminate Hugo first. To this end she uses a magic mirror to first capture him, and then the mirror is broken into three pieces and dispersed around the game world. The three troll kids now have to go out on their own to find the three pieces of the broken mirror and by combining them release Hugo, who will then be able to confront Scylla and save Hugolina from her.\n(The intro story does not seem to include how Hugolina gets captured, but it is part of the box text.)<br><br>The troll kids each have a world location with a piece of the mirror, and meet various enemies like beavers and soldiers in some 30+ levels with platform jumping on a 2D scrolling screen. Using magic freeze-rays, enemies are frozen into iceblocks, then dropped from a height to shatter, giving health items or coins. At the end of each location (10-12 levels) a boss appears carrying a mirror piece.<br><br>The GBA and GBC versions use different graphics, and while the GBA has some videos very similar to the PC/PS1 versions, the GBC has to make do with slideshows of still images for the story.<br><br>",
