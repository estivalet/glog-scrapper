  "description": "This installment of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Black%2fMatrix+series\">Black/Matrix series</a> is set in the same universe, a world which is populated by angels with white bird-like wings, demons with black bat-like wings, and wingless humans. For many years, the war between angels and demons has been going on. You control an ordinary boy named Cain. You live on a secluded island as a servant of a woman named Matia, far away and seemingly safe from the battle areas. But as both demons and angels seem to be interested in Matia and she gets kidnapped eventually, Cain realizes he must do everything to save her, and becomes involved in the great struggle.<br><br>This is a strategy RPG with turn-based combat, in which you navigate your party members on the isometric battle screen and attack or use magic spells when the enemy is in range. Story sequences occur between battles which take up most of the gameplay.",
