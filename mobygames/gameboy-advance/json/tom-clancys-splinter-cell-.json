  "description": "You're casted in a role of Sam Fisher, an secret operative that gets his hands dirty when others will not. Entering like a ghost, you'll have to rely to the stealth and make a good use of your surrounding to avoid direct conflict and end up outnumbered. The missions will follow pretty much the same storyline as the original game for PC/GC/PS2/XBOX with the emphasis on being a complete platformer with here and there some first-person sniping job to do.",
