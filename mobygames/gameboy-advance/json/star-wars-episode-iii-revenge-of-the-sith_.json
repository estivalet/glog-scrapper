  "description": "Decide which Jedi between Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi you would like to be; choose between 2 levels of difficulty and live the movie's storyline in single player mode.<br><br>The singleplayer mode is a side-scroller with a depth of field, which give a new dimension to explore while not in 3D. As you progress in the levels, the player can pick Mission Points that will help him to customize his character. It is actually the GBA version of the game but you can make the specials moves of the characters by pressing them on the touch screen. There is also 3 3D levels in each path that has been added to enhance the singleplayer experience.<br><br>In multiplayer, the player can pilot one of the 17 spacefighters in one of the 8 maps (2 in Coruscant, 4 in space, Hoth, Tatooine). The game is multi-card play and let you play against 3 other bots and/or players. In order to unlock all ships, the player will have to win in deathmatch against one of the movie's characters (Grievous, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, Boba Fett, Han Solo).",
