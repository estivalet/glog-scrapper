  "description": "<i>Bobble Tris</i> this is a <i>Tetris</i> variant, utilizing graphics borrowed from Taito's Puzzle Bobble series. The basic gameplay is identical. Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears. If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.",
