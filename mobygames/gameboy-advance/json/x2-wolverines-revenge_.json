  "description": "During the 1960's, a Canadian named Logan was used in a government-conducted experiment known as Weapon X. Unbreakable adamantium was ingested into his bones, in an attempt to turn him into a &quot;super-soldier&quot;. For the rest of his life, Logan (who adopted the nickname Wolverine) will have to fight against the beast inside him. Only after meeting Professor Xavier and his X-Men team, Wolverine is able to find a purpose in his life. However, as his memories return, he realizes that the Weapon X experiment has infected him with a deadly virus, and he has only two days to find the cure.<br><br>Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gamecube/x2-wolverines-revenge\">console and computer game</a> of the same name, this version of <i>X2: Wolverine's Revenge</i> is a side-scrolling platformer. Wolverine mostly uses his most powerful weapon, the adamantium claws, to strike enemies with. With the claws unsheathed, he can enter an even more devastating &quot;Rage Mode&quot;, achieved after the player repeatedly taps a button. Other abilities include dashing, clinging on walls and ceilings, and sliding to avoid taking falling damage. By pressing down a button, the player can also have the super-hero regenerate his health if he stands still.<br><br>Beside straightforward combat against regular enemies and bosses, the game also features stealth segments, during which Wolverine will have to traverse a stage unnoticed. He has a special stealth attack at his disposal, which will silently and instantly kill an unsuspecting enemy. Some levels also require the player to find specific items (such as keys) to proceed.",
