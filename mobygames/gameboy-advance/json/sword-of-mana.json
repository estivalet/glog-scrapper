  "description": "<i>Sword of Mana</i> tells the tale of two unlikely companions, a former prisoner out for revenge and the last known girl from the Mana tribe. The two come together, despite their differences, for one very important reason: they are the only ones that can save the Mana tree.<br><br>Like in other games in the series, the player can take control of both characters (or join with another player in co-op) and participate in action-oriented battles using spells, weapons and different kinds of items.
