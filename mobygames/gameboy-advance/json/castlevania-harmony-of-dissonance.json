  "description": "<i>Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</i> is the second <i>Castlevania</i> game to appear on the Game Boy Advance. Juste Belmont and friend Maxim are drawn to the newly resurrected Dracula's Castle in order to save their mutual friend Lydie, although it remains to be seen who will be saving whom.<br><br>The game is another <i>Castlevania</i> in the action/RPG style of the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night\">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/castlevania-circle-of-the-moon\">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a>. Juste is able to dash at will similar to Alucard, and use subweapons like the axe and holy water. By combining subweapons with magic tomes located throughout the castle he can increase both their power and their properties, such as turning the holy water into a rain that damages every monster onscreen, or turning a Bible into a holy shield that circles him. Juste can equip many kinds of armor and accessories, and he can modify his Vampire Killer whip with different tips that change its elemental property or increase its power. As an optional side quest, Juste can also find furniture and furnishings left around the castle and decorate a room with them, although there is no reward for doing so beyond a nice looking room.",
