  "description": "<i>Rotris</i> is a variant of Tetris. The basic gameplay is identical. Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears. If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.",
