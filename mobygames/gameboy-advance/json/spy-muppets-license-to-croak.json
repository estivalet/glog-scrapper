  "description": "Kermit the Frog agent of M.U.P.P.E.T. must find three villains and spoil their evil plans in this children's game.<br><br>In &quot;story&quot; mode, stopping each villain requires completing a series of mini arcade levels such as spy car chases or snowball battles (at a choice of three difficulty levels).  These mini-games can also be played individually in &quot;activity&quot; mode.<br><br>Muppet fans will enjoy the spy themed twists on familiar characters such as Gonzo the Great as &quot;Dr. Nose&quot; or Fozzie Bear as &quot;Agent Triple-F&quot; although there is no voice acting for their dialogue and the cut scenes are slideshows not animations (a limitation of GBA design).",
