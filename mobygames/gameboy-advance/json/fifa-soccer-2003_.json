  "description": "Electronic Arts' long-running FIFA soccer series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with <i>FIFA Soccer 2003</i>. It offers a selection of teams and modes from the concurrent <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/fifa-soccer-2003\">console version</a>, with simpler controls and traditional two-dimensional graphics.<br><br>The game includes 14 leagues (the same as in the console version minus the Brazilian league), including English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Primera División, Italian Serie A and North American Major League Soccer. In addition, there are 16 teams from the rest of the world (down from 40 in the console version) and 40 international teams. There is a license for real player names, with leagues and rosters based on the 2002-2003 season.<br><br>The teams can be used in friendly matches, two-player games via link cable and a number of competitions. These include league play for all of the included leagues, Club Championship (a league of the top 18 European clubs), EFA Trophy (akin to the real-world UEFA Cup, but without license) and European Champions Cup (akin to real-world UEFA Champions League, but without license). Competition progress is stored to battery-backed RAM, with two slots available.<br><br>Gameplay is seen from an angled overhead view parallel to the sidelines. Controls allow for lobs, kicks and passes on the offensive, and conservative and hard tackles on defense, with a sprint toggle also available. Selectable options include various skill levels (separately for team and goalkeeper), extra time (with Golden Goal option), as well as weather and wind conditions.<br><br>",
