  "description": "<i>Power Pro-kun Pocket 4</i> is a 2002 arcade Baseball simulator developed by Diamond Head and published by Konami for the Game Boy Advance. <br><br>The game's main feature is its Success story scenario, &quot;Sunrise Highschool Edition&quot;, which follows a boy who is inflicted with a deadly curse after accidentally knocking over a memorial headstone. His friends start vanishing and his Baseball club is set ablaze. If he does not rebuild the club and win the Koshien tournament in three years, even he will be dragged into a vortex of oblivion.<br><br>The player must manage the protagonist's weekly routine to train, recruit new teammates, fix the Baseball club and date one out of a few love interests. Failing the story's objectives or losing any late-game matches results in a game over which erases the player's save file. It is possible to reset the game to prevent that, but there are restrictions and penalties for doing so.<br><br>Clearing the first scenario 3 times reveals the Inner Success, which is called &quot;RPG-Style Fantasy&quot;. It follows a warrior in a fantasy world who must face various monstrous threats while looking for powerups and mystical spheres to build a Baseball Doll for a king. From this installment on, various characters from previous games are adapted into these alternate universes.<br><br>As suggested by the title, this mode features turn-based battles and random encounters. Allies can be found around the world and recruited, but will be lost if killed in combat or from other circumstances. The same inventory system from <i>Pawapoke 3</i> is used to manage powerups for the player character and his custom Baseball Doll. And although the player is under a limit of 200 actions to clear the story with, rushing through the mission can result in various events being lost, including the final boss.<br><br>Upon clearing either Success mode, the player can use the resulting character to build a custom team for playing Baseball on the Exhibition mode. Much of the game's replayability comes from attempting to earn the best possible ballplayers with strategy and luck. Matches between two people who own the game and a link cable are supported, and players can also share their characters via long passwords.",
