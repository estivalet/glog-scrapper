  "description": "Based on the GameCube series of the same name, <i>Super Monkey Ball Jr.</i> has you in control of 3D style arenas, each with a varying degree of difficulty and objectives. Your little monkey, inside a ball, relies on your movement of the arena to get to the required objectives (collecting items, getting to the finish line in under a certain time limit, etc.).<br><br>Apart from the single player puzzle experience (which includes more then 60 arenas), up to four people can play a collection of mini-games (which you must unlock in the single player game). Play monkey bowling (aka ten pin bowling), monkey fight (knock the other three players' monkey ball out of the circle arena) or an 18 hole mini golf challenge. ",
