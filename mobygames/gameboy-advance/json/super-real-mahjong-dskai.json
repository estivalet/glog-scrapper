  "description": "<i>Super Real Mahjong D?s?kai</i> is the second handheld game in the <i>Super Real Mahjong</i> series. Due to being on a Nintendo system, the nudity has been eliminated. However, the nudity has been sacrificed in order to bring all the girls from the entire series to the game. The player picks a group of girls from a previous arcade entry (with the exception of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-real-mahjong-pii\">PII</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-real-mahjong-piii\">PIII</a>, which are grouped together like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Real+Mahjong+PII+%26+PIII\">the home port</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-real-mahjong-pi\">PI</a>, which isn't included because it only included a generic opponent and never received any ports). After the player makes a selection, the computer randomly selects an order for the girls, and the player must face them in this order. After defeating an opponent in mahjong, the player will get a picture as a reward, sometimes risque, but not nude.",
