  "description": "Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/coin-flipper-1\">Coin Flipper 1</a>, <i>Coin Flipper 2</i> is a very small e-Reader application that lets the player flip a virtual Chansey coin. Unlike the other application, however, this version doesn't play infinitely: the goal is to get as many heads as possible before getting a tails. If even one tails is flipped, the round is over, and the player must start again. However, the game still keeps track of the percentage of heads the player gets. Only one card is required to play this game: the Supporter Trainer card Bill's Maintenance from the Expedition Base Set.",
