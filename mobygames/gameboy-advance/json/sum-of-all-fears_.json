  "description": "<i>The Sum of all Fears</i> is a shooter reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-rogue-spear_\">Rogue Spear</a>. The look and feel is alike, although it's simplified in its gameplay mechanics. It is also not a huge departure in comparison to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/sum-of-all-fears\">original version</a>, but obviously converted to a top-down perspective.<br><br>The game's story is built around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 15 missions, each with a secondary and primary objective.<br><br>\nIn this version, there are various team members to choose from which vary in their statistics (e.g. stealth, aim or reflex), and equipment. You can't make your own mission plans or switch between the team members (the others follow automatically and can't be given commands), so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). After finishing the campaign, the game unlocks the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; mode which allows to replay the game with only one team member.",
