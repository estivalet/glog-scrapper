  "description": "<i>Imakuni? no Ball</i> is a Pokémon-themed e-Reader application. It is a remake of the 1980 Game &amp; Watch game <i>Ball</i>, but the original player character has been replaced by Imakuni?, a character created to promote the Pokémon franchise. Similar the original LCD game, the player controls Imakuni? as he juggles three balls. The player uses the left and right directions on the D-pad or the A and B buttons to make Imakuni? move his arms to the left and right. Every time a ball hits one of Imakuni?'s hands, a point is rewarded. He must have his hand under a ball when it reaches his hands' level, or else it will fall to the ground and break in two, resulting in a game over.<br><br>The game is presented with Game &amp; Watch style graphics. The only card required to play this game is the Japan-exclusive P Promotional card Hikaru Imakuni? (Shining Imakuni?, 018/P).",
