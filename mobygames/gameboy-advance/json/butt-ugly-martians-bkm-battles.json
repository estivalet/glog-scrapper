  "description": "<i>Butt-Ugly Martians: B.K.M. Battles</i> is a side-scrolling shoot'em up game based on the cartoon of the same name. The Martian Emperor Bog has grown tired of his inefficient Earth-invaders-turned-Earth-protectors envoys and had dispatched an army of evil aliens to finally take over the Earth. The three Butt-Ugly Martians must stop him.<br><br>The player can pick their favorite Martian out of B-Bop A-Luna, 2T Fru-T, or Do-Wah Diddy, each with a different mix of attack, defense, and speed abilities. All of them are in &quot;butt-kicking mode&quot; (B.K.M.), meaning they don their powerful assault suit. <br><br>On each level, the player is tasked with destroying aliens and unlocking doors by finding the correct keys to reach the end of the space cavern where a boss enemy will be waiting for them. Various power-ups can be picked up to increase the abilities of the playable characters: extra fire power, extra armor, temporary invincibility, turbo, etc. <br><br>Occasionally, the player will be confronted by Stoat Muldoon, an alien hunter and long-time antagonist of the Butt-Ugly Martians, who can be defeated by simply collecting a memory erasing crystal and using it against him. The game contains a total of 28 levels spread over 7 worlds. There are three difficulty levels and progress is saved using a password system. <br><br>Butt-Ugly Martians: B.K.M. Battles also features Gamecube connectivity with the game Butt Ugly Martians: Zoom or Doom in which special content can be unlocked by collecting five colored gems in the Game Boy Advance game.",
