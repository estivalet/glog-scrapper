Each player has different statistics based on running, passing, catching, kicking and block/tackle. Custom characters can be created. In Exhibition matches the player and the computer take turns selecting a player to build a team. Matches have optional pre- and post-game commentary through an animated sequence. Multiplay plays and strategies are supported.<br><br>Gameplay is shown through a side-scrolling bird's-eye view from the sideline.
