  "description": "Medal of Honor Infiltrator is a shooter from a top-down viewpoint. The top-down graphics and gameplay are reminiscent of classic games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Commando\">Commando</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/front-line\">Frontline</a>.<br><br>In its 15 total levels, Infiltrator brings together a variety of different play styles that should be familiar to anyone who's played their fair share of 8- and 16-bit games. <br><br>You can hide behind houses and other buildings to stop enemy bullets.\nIf you come across a stationary gun or a tank sitting in a level, you can put these weapons to use against the enemy.\n \nEach level has a number of mission objectives assigned to it, such as locating documents or destroying ammunition depots. To complete a level, you need to accomplish these goals. <br><br>The difficulty level is, like its forerunners, high and urges the players all the time.",
