  "description": "Ghosts are everywhere. This comes as a simple fact to the Shaman Yoh Asakura, a young boy with the ability to see and talk to the spirits that wander the world. While he would prefer to take things easy, the Shaman King Tournament is coming up, and some of the people who want to become Shaman King really shouldn't be given that kind of power. Assisted by the ghost of a great samurai, it is up to Yoh to make sure the spirit world remains untroubled by becoming the Shaman King.<br><br>Gameplay bears a close resemblance to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Pok%c3%a9mon+main+RPG+series\">Pokémon series</a>. Fight troubled spirits, or other Shamans. One spirit can attack at a time, with the ability to switch the attacking spirit out at any time. <i>Shaman King</i> does give you the ability to combine spirits, and some rare spirits can only be acquired in this way.<br><br><i>Soaring Hawk</i> differs from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/shaman-king-legacy-of-the-spirits-sprinting-wolf\">Sprinting Wolf</a> in the selection of spirits. While most of the 1000 spirits can be found in both versions, there are some unique spirits that can only be found in one version. You can trade spirits with your friends to complete your collection.",
