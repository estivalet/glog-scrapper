  "description": "Ian Rider is a spy for the British government, investigating Herod Sayle. Herod Sayle has offered to give every schoolchild in the country a free &quot;Stormbreaker&quot; computer, but the government doesn't trust him. They trust him even less after Ian is gunned down. That's when Ian's fourteen-year-old nephew Alex comes in. Trained by Ian for years, Alex is recruited by MI6 to investigate Sayle. Alex is tasked with infiltrating Sayle's mansion and finding out just what is going on. Based on the book and movie of the same name.<br><br>Gameplay is equal parts stealth and action. Some enemies are better off avoided, while others you'll want to take out. Collect keycards, use spy gadgets, and be careful. After each level, you'll gain new combat techniques or spy gadgets.",
