  "description": "<i>Gem Smashers</i> is an action puzzle game where the player has to rescue prehistoric creatures captured by a fearsome scientist from outer space. Three creatures, Bau, Bam and Bom have already escaped and the player takes control of these. The game consists of single screen levels that are full of gems in different colours. It's the player's task to destroy these with the use of the little creature that bounces around the screen. The problem is that the creature can only destroy gems of the same colour as itself and therefore it's necessary to hit specific colour changing blocks that may be hidden in a rock that first has to be broken. To make it all a bit trickier there are also death blocks marked by skulls that the player has to avoid hitting. Once all gems have been destroyed an exit opens and the player can move on to the next level. <br><br>The game has a story mode with more than 100 levels, an arcade mode with more than 60 levels and a battle mode for two players via link cable. There are also three special modes that the player can unlock. The story mode consists of a world map where for each section the player can complete the levels in any order. Each section ends with a boss fight. Depending on which of the creatures the player chooses to play as he will start at different sections. The arcade mode has a more linear level structure. ",
