The Terminator can also activate the films' red-tinted Terminator vision for a limited time, to spot hidden items or areas and cause additional damage to enemies.<br><br>Two players can fight through unique co-op challenges over a link cable, where they will fight spawning enemies and bosses in progressive rooms. Up to four players can also control their own Terminator in a capture-the-flag arena mode.",
