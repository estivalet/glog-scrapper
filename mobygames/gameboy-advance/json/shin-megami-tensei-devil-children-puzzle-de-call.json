  "description": "A puzzle game spin-off of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Devil+Children\">Devil Children</a> series. Devil children Rand and Gale (half-human, half-demon creatures able to switch forms) go across a weird-looking portal in search of their missing friends and in order to get to them they must sort out several puzzle stages.<br><br>The game is a top-down block-pushing puzzle game in which the player must use their demonic form to make their way across each stage collecting demon eggs that enhance their powers (allowing them to break certain blocks, etc.). &quot;Boss&quot; stages also feature a giant demon who continually attacks the player, whose  objective is to collect all eggs while avoiding attacks.",
