  "description": "After defeating Ogura in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=4902370506853\">Densetsu no Stafi 2</a>, Stafi has earned a break.  However, Ogura manages to escape once more, causing havoc across the kingdom as he flees.  Stafi must track him down, and this time his little sister Stapi is along for the ride as well.<br><br><i>Densetsu no Stafi 3</i> is the third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Densetsu+no+Stafi+series\">Densetsu no Stafi series</a>, and the first to introduce a new playable character.  Players control both Stafi, and his younger pink sister Stapi.  While Stafi retains his original moves, Stapi has some tricks of her own, such as a wall jump and crawling through narrow gaps, which allow her to access places that Stafi can't.<br><br>The goal of each level is to reach the bonus roulette at the end of each stage.  This is done by performing tasks for characters, as the path to the roulette is initially blocked off.  Tasks usually consist of finding an item, destroying enemies, or defeating a boss.  Along the way, Stafi and Stapi will learn additional moves which will allow them to access areas that were previously unreachable.<br><br>Players can collect orbs within the level - these both serve as the game's currency and health.  Bonus orbs can also be earned by scoring consecutive enemy hits within a time period.  Orbs can be used to purchase outfits for Stafi to wear.",
