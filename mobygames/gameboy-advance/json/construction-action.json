  "description": "<i>Construction: Action</i> is a Pokémon-themed e-Reader application. In it, multiple cards are scanned to build a mini-platform game. The goal is for the player to catch all the Pokémon on the screen before the timer runs out. That said, there are several player characters with different statistics, and the one used depends on the card scanned. Likewise, there are several different maps, each with different Pokémon, depending on what card is scanned. One map may be played at a time, but the game is experienced at its fullest when the maximum number of six map cards are scanned, creating a long, multi-screened stage. The player must choose the order of the maps wisely, however, because the layout of the maps may create walls making it impossible to traverse.<br><br>The game is played by throwing Poké Balls at Pokémon, and most Pokémon take several to catch. The Pokémon will also attack the player. The player loses if they fall into a bottomless pit, they get hit by a Pokémon's attack, they touch a Pokémon, or the timer runs out. If the player runs out of Poké Balls, they will have to look for extras on the map.<br><br>Cards for <i>Construction: Action</i> can be found in the Aquapolis and Skyridge expansions.\n",
