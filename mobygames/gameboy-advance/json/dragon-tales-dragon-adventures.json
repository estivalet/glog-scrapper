  "description": "<i>Dragon Tales: Dragon Adventures</i> is a game based on the animated series Dragon Tales. The game follows two young children, Emmy and Max, who travel into a book full of dragons and fairies. There are five &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; to choose from. The game is a simple platformer, with each story varying slightly. In the first story, &quot;Dragon-Berry Days,&quot; you must find all of the Dragon Berries that have dispersed. In the second story, &quot;Bye-Bye Flutterby,&quot; Max's flutterby collection has scattered. In the third story, &quot;Help, I'm Lost,&quot; you must help baby animals find their friends. In the fourth story, &quot;Puzzle Wood,&quot; you must help collect puzzle pieces. In the fifth and final story, &quot;Scaliwag,&quot; you must help Captain Scaliwag find his maps and his treasure. All five stories are similar, but the level designs are changed, along with the desired item.  Signs let you change characters, as some have different abilities, Max and Emmy can crawl in small places. The dragons can hover for a short time and fly when needed. Along with the desired item, you can also collect cupcakes, jewels, and music notes for points.<br><br>The Game Boy Advance version also has a training level to show you things like slides, drums to bounce on, poles, and other gimmicks found throughout the game. Also, Zak and Wheezie are added as playable characters rather than the main characters of a mission. All stories are present, but the visuals and presentation are raised to fit the next-generation system.",
