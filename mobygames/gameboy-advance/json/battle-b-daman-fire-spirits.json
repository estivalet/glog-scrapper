  "description": "<i>Battle B-Daman: Fire Spirits!</i> is an action game based on the anime TV series of the same name, which is in turn based on the B-Daman line of toys. It is a follow-up to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/battle-b-daman\">Battle B-Daman</a> game released in the same year. The game is mainly about one-to-one battles between two robots interspersed with some story elements. By winning matches new parts become available offering customization options. The battles are played from a first-person perspective where the robot can only be moved left or right, firing coloured plastic balls to damage the opponent and avoiding the incoming attacks.<br><br>The story revolves around the character Yamato Delgado who, after becoming a B-Dachampion, now enters the Winners Tournament. Most of the game he is in search of Strike Shots that will help him ensure victories. It initially follows the story of the early anime episodes, but then changes introducing a new antagonist called Death Poker Alliance. They are after the Petrified Parts Yamato is looking for.<br><br>The game contains a main Adventure mode focusing on the store as well as a Battle mode. There are also six mini-games: Battle Shoot, Gate Check, Puzzle Wall, Snipe Shoot, Target Bug and Target Hit.<br><br>There are many strategic elements during the battles based on different special and charged attacks. The Zero System concept of the original game is replaced with the Blaster Core System. It allows for the customization of special moves by equipping a specific core.",
