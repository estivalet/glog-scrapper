Ripto, naturally, is taking full advantage of this, as he starts sending his armies of rhynocs through the portal to wreak havoc. Spyro must find somehow find a way to close the portal before Ripto succeeds in taking over the Dragon Realms.<br><br>This is Spyro's third outing on the Game Boy Advance. Features include new RPG-like elements, new upgradable breath abilities, and three playable characters (Spyro, Agent 9 the Space Monkey, and Sgt. Byrd). Bonus multiplayer Sgt.Byrd levels can also be unlocked.\n",
