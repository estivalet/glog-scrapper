  "description": "Get Ready to Yeti in this 2.5D overhead arcade adventure game.  You are the Urban Yeti who is on a quest to find a mate so that you can propagate the species.  Hunted and feared by the human population, you make your way through four city stages and four arcade minigames based on classic titles from the 80's.  Urban Yeti! is notable for its bizarre humor and relative obscurity.",
