  "description": "<i>Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland</i> is a remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kirbys-adventure\">Kirby's Adventure</a>. The core gameplay has been changed little, with Kirby absorbing enemies in order to take their powers. In addition to a graphical update, some level designs have been altered, the mini-bosses have been increased in size, one of whom (the rolling turtle) has been replaced with an elephant-like creature, and two new mini-games replace the claw and egg eating mini-games from the original, both of which feature a multiplayer option. Air Grind involves Kirby grinding racing against clones of himself by grinding a warp star against a rail, while Bomb Rally involves the four Kirbys tossing a bomb between each other using frying pans.",
