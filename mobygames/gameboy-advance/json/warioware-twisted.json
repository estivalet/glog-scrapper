  "description": "Wario's thrown a temper tantrum while playing his Game Boy Advance, and gone and broken it!  He heads off to the manic Dr. Crygor's lab to get him to fix it.  But what happens instead is that hundreds of Game Boy-like systems are created, with no buttons and an addictive tilt control!  Wario's gonna be even richer than ever before when he sells this!<br><br><i>WarioWare Twisted!</i> is the sequel to the sleeper hit <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496732370\">WarioWare Inc.: Mega: Microgame$!</a>.  It includes a built-in rumble pack and gyro sensor which the games have been designed around.  Over two hundred five second games are hurled at the player as they make their way through the stage, trying to figure out what to do with a short description like &quot;Play!&quot;, &quot;Avoid!&quot; or &quot;Digest!&quot;.  Each stage has a random game thrown at you, with a short time to complete it.  Fail it, and you lose one of your four lives.  Lose all four and it's game over.  Pass enough games, and you'll get told &quot;FASTER!&quot; and the games start coming at you at a quicker speed.  Finally, you'll encounter a Boss Stage, which has no time limit and is tougher to beat.<br><br>Each character's stage is based around a different 'theme'.  Mona's games require you to make only a small spin to pass them, Jimmy T.'s games need a consistent rhythm to play, Kat and Ana's games simply need the use of the A Button, Dr. Crygor's games involve changing gravity itself, while the Nintendo nerd pair 9-Volt and 18-Volt have a set of Nintendo games which use all of the different styles of play from the other game sets.<br><br><i>Twisted!</i> also has a huge amount of novelty unlockables to collect.  Once you've played through Story Mode, you can replay the games again for a higher score and bonus toys.  Whenever you beat a Boss Game after completing Story Mode once, you'll be prompted to spin to get a bonus prize.  This prize could be as simple as a light wand that you shake to see a picture, or a small arcade-style game involving sewing or rolling a cat around the floor while shooting bugs.",
