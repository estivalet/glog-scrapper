  "description": "Based off the updated cartoon of the popular '80's toy, Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Greyskull puts players in the role of He-Man as he hacks and slashes through a 13-level quest to confront the evil Skeletor.<br><br>Taking a nod to such classic beat-em ups like Golden Axe or Gauntlet, He-Man makes his way through the various areas of Eternia fighting hordes of Skeletor's underlings while searching for keys to open doors, power-ups to enhance strength and defense, and He-Man's captured friends, such as Man-At-Arms or Cringer.  He-Man can stop the enemies from advancing upon him by destroying the warp portals that are scattered throughout the area.<br><br>Along the way, He-Man can even ride on Battle Cat through &quot;shooter&quot; style levels to get to new areas and face Skeletor's main minions, such as Beast Man and Clawful.<br><br>Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Greyskull uses a password save to mark player's progress throughout the game.",
