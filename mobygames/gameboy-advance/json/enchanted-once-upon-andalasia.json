  "description": "<i>Enchanted: Once Upon Andalasia</i> is based on the movie Enchanted and begins with Giselle telling a bedtime story to young Morgan Phillip about Andalasia. The game begins and the player takes control of Giselle, the barefoot princess of Andalasia. Giselle is soon introduced to the concept of working together with her animal friends to complete certain tasks and finish each level. Later on in the game the player also plays as Prince Edward who has to save the maidens of the land.<br><br>This game is a side-scrolling action platform game with puzzle solving elements. Giselle and Pip both have different skills, and much like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/lost-vikings\">Lost Vikings</a> series, the player can switch between the two in order to progress through the levels. The puzzle element of the game come in the use of a combination of their skills such as Giselle's ability to jump, float, pick up objects, and hang from ledges and Pip's abilities to push objects, climb walls, enter small passage ways, and distract the enemies. Working together they are able to knock their foes unconscious and, with Giselle's singing, free the woodland creatures trapped within them. Some woodland creatures are trapped in cages and once freed will aid Giselle with their various skills such as birds helping her float across small gaps and to slow her descent during a long fall.",
