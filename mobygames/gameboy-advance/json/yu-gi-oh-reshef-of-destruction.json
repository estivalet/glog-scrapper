  "description": "Reshef the Dark Being has been released by someone who fused the three Egyptian God Cards.  This has caused the cards to be turned to stone and all the Millennium pieces are now missing.  It is up to Yugi, Joey, and you to find these pieces and the cards in order to stop Reshef before he plunges the world into darkness.<br><br>There are more than 100 duelists to duel with to help you gain the cards needed for a deck powerful enough to defeat Reshef.  Build up your duelist level so you can have more powerful cards in your deck.  Buy, sell, and wager cards in order to improve your deck.  With over 800 cards and the three Egyptian God cards, you can personalize your deck however you choose.<br><br>Use the Link cable to duel friends, trade cards, and improve your skill level, or just duel the opponents in the game itself.  The choice is yours.<br><br>The game is played through with a storyline rather than just dueling.  This helps to move things along and keep the player interested.  You must defeat Reshef.  Can you do it?",
