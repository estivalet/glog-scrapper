  "description": "<i>The Sims 2: Pets</i> proposes you to take control of a Sim and his pet in the little town of Baskerville. The gameplay is the usual one when it comes to the Sims. You have to satisfy the daily needs of your character and his animal. The primary concerns are: sleeping, eating, keeping clean, using the toilet, relaxing, watching TV, interacting with people and spending time at home. The pet can be taught tricks and enter competition. In this version, for gaining money, your Sim can work in domains related to pets: pet walker, pet trainer, veterinarian, etc..",
