  "description": "<i>Tokotoko Truck</i> is a Pokémon-themed e-Reader application. In this game the player controls two Pichu (possibly the Pichu Bros.) as they travel down a railroad on a drasine, on their way to Pokémon Center Tokyo. A timer is present, which starts at 30 seconds. Along the way, the Pichu will pass several train stations. Each time a train station is passed, a random amount of time is added to the timer, allowing the Pichu more time to reach their destination. However, the tracks are riddled with boulders. Each time the drasine collides with a boulder, it slows down, eating away precious time. The game will end either when the timer runs out (resulting in a game over) or when the Pichu finally reach the Pokémon Center. Six cards are needed to play this game, all of which are promotional cards available only at the JR Train Rally in August 2002: Celebi, Entei, Pikachu, Pichu, Mewtwo and Lugia.",
