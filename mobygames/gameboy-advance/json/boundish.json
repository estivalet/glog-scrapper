  "description": "Boundish is a series of five different two player games, mostly based around the very first video game ever made, Pong.  You can choose to play these games either versus a CPU opponent, or head-to-head against another player.  Player one is always red, and player two is always blue.  The games are:<br><br><li><b>Pool Flower</b><br>\nTwo players bounce a ball left and right between each other, aiming to get it past the opposing player to score a point.  Players can move up and down the entirety of the screen, as well as forward and back about a third of the screen.  Circles of varying size float around the screen - if these are hit, they turn the same color as the last player who hit the ball away.<br><br><li><b>Box Juggling</b><br>\nThe odd game out of the bunch - this game is instead based on Nintendo's very first Game &amp; Watch game, Ball.  One player walks left and right at the bottom of the screen, keeping a box in the air.  If the box hits the ground, it's game over.  Pressing A makes the player push the box back in the air - if the player hits the box with their head, it still counts as a hit, but the player is briefly stunned.  Power ups and additional boxes appear as the game progresses to keep things different.<br><br><li><b>Power Slider</b><br>\nTwo players stand around the edge of a binocular-shaped field.  They bounce a puck between each other, and each time it bounces, it leaves a hole in the playfield.  Players can hold the A Button and let it go just as the puck approaches them to perform a power shot.  Players hug their circular side of the playfield to take shots at the puck.<br><br><li><b>Human League</b><br>\nThe screen is divided into two sides, and two human-shaped paddles are on each side.  The game plays somewhat like doubles tennis, in that if the first player misses the ball, the second player has a chance to recover it.  Using Up and Down moves both players (the second player moves more slowly), while Left and Right moves the player closer to the net only.  Pressing A while holding Up or Down will make the outer player make a dash for the corner in that direction.<br><br><li><b>Wild Go Round</b><br>\nThis game has the two players rotating around a vinyl record.  The goal is to get the opponent to drop the ball off the record.  Each time a player hits the ball, the record rotates, and the label changes color.  If the label is the same color as your player, you will score a point.  The record's rotation also affects the movement of the ball.",
