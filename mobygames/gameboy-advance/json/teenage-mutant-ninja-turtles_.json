  "description": "The heroes in a half shell are back in an all new adventure. The four turtles have been split up in order to combat the many bad guys that surround the city.<br><br>Each turtle (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael &amp; Donatello) has their own set of levels to complete, with their own distinct moves and combat options to use during battle. Along with a set of side-scrolling levels, complete with end of level boss battles, the four turtles will also get the chance to race through the sewers in the unique 3rd person race modes, shooting down the enemy or collecting items, while Donatello takes to the sky in the Shell Glider and Raphael challenges Casey Jones to a one-on-one cycle race.",
