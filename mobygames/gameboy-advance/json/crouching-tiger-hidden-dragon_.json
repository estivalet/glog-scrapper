Jen carries the sword Green Destiny and she can performs basic attacks on the ground, as well as in the air, or perform more impressive moves such as mid-air double-jumps or flying kicks. She can also climb by pushing off walls. By defeating enemies, a chi meter is filled, which allows to perform special moves. Chi can also be used to cure status ailments such as poison or daze.",
