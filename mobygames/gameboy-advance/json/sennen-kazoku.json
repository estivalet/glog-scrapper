  "description": "In <i>Sennen Kazoku</i>, the player assumes the role of Cupid, who has been assigned by God to watch over a family. Cupid's job is to protect them through the generations. Much of the game is spent watching the family members' daily lives. However, Cupid can also change the course of their lives. By using his arrows, he can change their attitudes and emotions by making them work harder, calming them down, and fall in love. The internal clock makes the game run even when it is powered off, so the family's life will never stop.",
