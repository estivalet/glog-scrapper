  "description": "<i>Lunar Legend</i> is a version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=lunar%3a+the+silver+star\">Lunar: The Silver Star</a>, which contains some of the changes introduced in its remake, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=lunar%3a+silver+star+story+complete\">Lunar: Silver Star Story</a>.<br><br>Graphical style and story-related changes are closer to the remade version than to the original. However, this version does not contain the anime movie cutscenes from the remake, replacing them with still shots. Also, random battles from the original version return, as opposed to visible enemies of the remake.<br><br>Changes unique to this version include the introduction of power special moves, which can be unleashed during battles once a special bar is replenished, and elimination of an explorable world map in favor of linear &quot;dot-to-dot&quot; movement between locations. This version also has a different English translation. ",
