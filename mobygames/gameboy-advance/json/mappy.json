Doors are your only defense against the cats. You get from floor to floor by jumping on one of the trampolines.<br><br>Points are earned by recovering stolen goods. Other ways of earning points are bouncing on a trampoline, putting cats in the microwave, striking a cat with a door, striking cats with a bell, retrieving a treasure from the Boss cat Goro or dropping cats through a hole in the floor.\n",
