  "description": "The Game Boy Advance version of <i>Starsky &amp; Hutch</i> is different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Starsky+%26+Hutch\">console versions</a>, but still a racing game in full 3D. The 3D polygonal graphics are very different and the violence has been toned down due to Nintendo's policies. Some of the voice-overs are intact, and others are absent, due to the GBA's limitations. The episodes are presented as levels, and split into groups.",
