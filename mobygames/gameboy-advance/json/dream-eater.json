  "description": "Drowzee loves to eat dreams and unfortunately the only things about are belligerent primeapes that don't take kindly to having their dreams served up as food. <br><br>As Drowzee you'll need to hypnotize your mark before you can eat it's dream. You'll do this by moving to the primeape's left or right at sending soporific mental waves into the back of it's head. Waves are cast with a and movement is done wit the d-pad. If the primeape spots you it will punch you right out of the screen so be careful to be on the side it's not looking at.<br><br>After you put the primeape to sleep you'll automatically feast on it's dream, gain a point, and then move onto the next monkey. The primeapes get swifter for each dream you've eaten. <br><br>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Drowzee (74a or b/147), Mr. Mime (43/92), Smoochum (61/147), Jynx (18/147), Hypno (16/147), Espeon (11/147). Or in Japan the Pokemon e-card expansion 2 cards Drowzee (40/92), Mr. Mime (43/92), Smoochum (47/92), Jynx (44/92), Hypno (41/92), Espeon (45/92).",
