  "description": "<i>Rocky</i> is a boxing game that was inspired by the first five Rocky movies.<br><br>The main mode is called Movie mode which follows Rocky's career from small-time boxer to champ. There are 20 opponents from the movie for Rocky to fight. Beating certain boxers will unlock cutscenes inspired by the movies and is basically the games narrative moments.<br><br>In this mode Rocky has to train before each match so his skills can improve. Training increases Rocky's strength, speed, stamina, and defense statistics. Training includes sparring with a padded trainer, hitting the heavy bag, or punching the speed bag. These activities can be done manually or automatically as the player so chooses. When in the ring Rocky can throw left and right punches, do combos, and can dodge punches.<br><br>Other modes include Exhibition mode, Knockout mode, and a 2 player Versus Mode. In exhibition mode players can fight any boxer they unlocked from the Movie mode and they also have the option to select the venue, the round length, the number of rounds, and the computer's difficulty level. Knockout mode is unlocked only after Movie mode is completed. It is basically a survival mode in which the player selects a series of fighters against whom to compete for belts in a tournament.\n",
