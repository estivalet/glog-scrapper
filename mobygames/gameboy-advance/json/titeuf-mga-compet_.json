  "description": "<i>Titeuf: Méga compet'</i> is a French collection of mini-games based on the comic book series <i>Titeuf</i>. The GBA version is in 2D and is completely different from the 3D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/titeuf-mga-compet\">Titeuf: Méga compet'</a> game for PS2 and Windows. After seeing a program about cloning on television, Titeuf and his classmates are worried they will be cloned as well. They participate in different activities to prevent this from happening.<br><br>After each activity points can be earned in three categories: <i>méga bisou</i>, <i>méga style</i> and <i>méga bêtise</i>. The environment of the school acts as the main hub. It it shown through a top-down view and a star can be moved to scroll and select an activity. There are various mini-games. In one Titeuf is positioned on a window up high and he needs to pee on his classmates without hitting any passing adults. The player has to direct the stream. Another one shows him from a top-down view running in the park. He needs to hit his friends with a water gun before time runs out, also avoiding adults. The gun regularly needs to be refilled at the fountain. In another Titeuf needs to select a cool magazine at the newsagent's and avoid bad ones. At school he needs to undress a woman in a picture as quickly as possible by picking the next item of clothing to remove out of three options before time runs out.<br><br>The game uses a calendar system for a school week and a certain amount of points need to be earned before the week is over. Through a cell phone in the top left corner text messages can be received. Titeuf can reply, choosing from different options, to send gag texts. Next to the main single-player mode there is the <i>méga compet'</i> mode where various mini-games can be accessed directly. In this mode up to two players are supported. An example is a vertical split-screen running game where the characters need to jump over obstacles.",
