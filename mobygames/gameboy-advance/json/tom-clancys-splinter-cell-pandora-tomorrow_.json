  "description": "The hand-held version features the same story as its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow\">console cousins</a>, but tells it in a completely different way using a side-scrolling view with 22 different objectives and new locations to play in. The same stealth maneuvers can be used in this one as well: using shadows to hide, sneaking around, using human shields, forcing suspects to talk and even hide behind objects.<br><br>Night and Thermal vision can be used at any time and features three different scope views: Camera Shoot, Sniper and Laser Mic.  Things like rappelling from rooftops and lock picking are still a part of the game, but is done in the form of mini-games.",
