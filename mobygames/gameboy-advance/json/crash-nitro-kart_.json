  "description": "<i>Crash Nitro Kart</i> is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Crash+Nitro+Kart\">the console game of the same name</a>. It features the same characters/teams and story as the console game, and has the same adventure mode as the console game. Tracks have the same names as their console counterparts but have been drastically redesigned to work on the portable screens. The game utilises 2D sprites as opposed to the console game's 3D models, and also lacks the FMVs featured in the console game.",
