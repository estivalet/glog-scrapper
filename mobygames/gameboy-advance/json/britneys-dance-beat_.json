  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/britneys-dance-beat\">Britney's Dance Beat</a>, the rhythm game licensed from pop star Britney Spears, received its own version for the Game Boy Advance, with similar gameplay, but a unique selection of modes, and graphics and sound tailored to the handheld platform.<br><br>The game's main mode is called Dance Mode. It features two main stages: Practice Mode and Concert Mode. Practice Mode has to be completed first before Concert Mode opens up. Each consists of the same five songs, but Concert Mode increases the difficulty. Actual gameplay consists of a radar-like object spinning clockwise on the left of the screen, highlighting the buttons to be pressed in rhythm with the music, while a rendition of Britney Spears dances along on the right of the screen. Depending on if and how well the notes are hit, a score of either &quot;great&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; is given. The simpler songs in Practice involve only a single button, but later songs include both the A and B buttons, and, in Concert Mode only, also require the D-Pad to be pressed at the same time. To complete a song and move on to the next, a scoring threshold must be met. Finishing a song also unlocks pictures of the star to be looked at in the Tour Book. Finishing every song in Concert Mode unlocks a video clip of a concert performance.<br><br>There is also a two-player mode via link cable, which is similar to the main game mode in the console version: both players have their own rhythm indicator. Good performance allows attacks on the other player, shuffling their controls for additional difficulty. An additional single-player game mode is the Puzzle Mode: a simple sliding puzzle, with four different pictures available (three of which must be unlocked in Dance Mode).<br><br>While the included Britney Spears songs are the same as in the console version, they are not simply played back digitally. Due to hardware limitations, they are only approximated with percussion samples and the occasional voice sample, but the main vocal track is played through a GBA synthesizer.",
