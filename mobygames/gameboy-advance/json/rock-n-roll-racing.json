  "description": "<i>Rock 'n Roll Racing</i> is an arcade combat racing game. Combat plays a heavy role in the game, as each car has a frontal weapon, such as a laser or missile, and a drop weapon, such as spikes or mines. As you complete races, you get more money to upgrade your car. The soundtrack features famous rock tracks such as &quot;Born to Be Wild, &quot;Bad to the Bone,&quot; &quot;The Peter Gunn Theme,&quot; &quot;Highway Star&quot; and &quot;Paranoid.&quot;<br><br>The game is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=rpm-racing\">RPM Racing</a>. The later released PC version is an official release, but based on the SNES version incorporating the ZSNES emulator and limited to three tracks.",
