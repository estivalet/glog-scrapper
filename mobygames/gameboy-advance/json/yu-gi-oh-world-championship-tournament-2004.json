  "description": "Yu-Gi-Oh! returns in the form of a Tournament edition which will be used in an official Worldwide Tournament in 2004 in Los Angeles.  The game also has a text translation utility that will allow gamers who link with one another to translate text automatically between languages.  The languages included are Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and English.  These are also the languages you can view the game in.<br><br>The game continues the tradition of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card battles.  There is little to the game other than battling your opponents.  This game is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/gameId,11907/\">Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel</a> and offers more than 1000 cards to use as well as new opponents.  The game takes out some of the non-card battling features from the Worldwide Edition and leaves you with the battling as the main feature of the game.<br><br>Build up to three decks with the cards you gain as you work to beat all your opponents.  With over 1000 cards, you will have a wide range of choices for your 40-card decks.<br><br>As with the Worldwide Edition, you can also trade your cards with friends through the Link Cable.<br><br>",
