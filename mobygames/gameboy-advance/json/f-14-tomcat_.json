  "description": "One of the Game Boy Advance's launch titles from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Majesco+Entertainment+Company\">Majesco</a> (alongside <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/boxing-fever\">Boxing Fever</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/iridion-3d\">Iridion 3D</a>), <em>F-14 Tomcat</em> is essentially a port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Absolute+Entertainment%2c+Inc%2e\">Absolute Entertainment's</a> 1994 SNES game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/turn-and-burn-no-fly-zone\">Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone</a>. The game content is exactly the same, but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of the game and the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline: the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US government to be assigned in the theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to protect America's &quot;interests&quot; in the region.<br><br>The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice mode, like <em>Turn and Burn</em>. It was later implemented in Majesco's two following GBA flight sims, 2004's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Hornet+F%2fA-18F\">Super Hornet F/A-18F</a> and 2007's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/f24-stealth-fighter\">F24 Stealth Fighter</a>, which re-used this game's engine, with the option of selecting between a landing carrier or a landing strip.",
