  "description": "The Dark Dragon was defeated by our hero in the first Shining Soul, and the people rejoiced as the Darkness faded away.  People are quick to forget, however.  As time passed, people's lives improved and they forgot about the Darkness.  But as the Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the balance between Light and Dark and soon Darkness was on the rise once again.<br><br>A prophet comes and warns the people of the impending dangers, but no one listens to him.  Although his crystal shows the upcoming dangers, the people pass by without any interest.  An agent of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures this prophet outside the city and kills him and shatters his crystal so the people remain ignorant of what is coming.<br><br>This same agent gives the &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; to Deatharte, the trusted adviser to King Marcel in Klantol Castle.  The adviser didn't trust Gillespie, but curiosity is a powerful force.<br><br>It is now up to another hero to take on the journey to once again stop this growing Darkness.  After choosing your character from 8 possible, you start out on his or her way to a tournament being held at Klantol castle.  On your way, you meet an adventurer who will explain how to battle.  Your journey then takes you to the castle to start the tournament.<br><br>This tournament is interrupted when the king finds out his daughter is missing.  The king's adviser heads out to find her, and the king asks that you go as well.  It is here that your story really begins.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type where the monsters are fought in real-time.  An interesting part of this game is that your resistances will increase when used.  Outside the castle, you can stand on a fire that will not damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to the fire, it will increase slowly.  Traps will also increase your resistance if you are hit by them, though you will also be hurt.  Only the one fire is safe.<br><br>Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new equipment.  But most of all, save the world from Darkness.",
