  "description": "<i>Mario Tennis: Power Tour</i> is the portable sibling of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gamecube/mario-power-tennis\">Mario Power Tennis</a> on the GameCube. <br><br>Aside from the standard spins, drop shots, lobs, and smashes available in a standard game of tennis, <i>Power Tour</i> adds power shots into the mix. Offensive power shots can be used to end a long-rally in your favor, while defensive power shots can help you make an impossible save.<br><br>Following in the footsteps of other portable Mario Sports titles, <i>Power Tour</i> adds a bit of RPG-like features into the mix of standard tennis action. Story mode has you guide either one of the rookie players, Max or Tina, through the ranks of competitors in the academy on their way to the Island Open Championships. Winning matches against opponents in the academy rewards you with points you can use to raise your stats. Matches can either be in one-on-one Singles matches, or you can team up with an AI-controlled partner in Doubles. <br><br>In between matches, you are also given the opportunity to explore the academy and participate in training courts and several mini-games, such as weight-lifting, to further build up your stats. Exhibition modes are also available for quick pick-up-and-play gameplay. Multiplayer modes include Singles and Doubles matches where you can choose from the stock cast of characters or you can also opt to use your powered up characters from the Story mode against each other.",
