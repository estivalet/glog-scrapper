  "description": "<i>Robot Wars 2: Extreme Destruction</i> brings together all the elements of the TV show. Players can design and build their own robots, drawing upon a database of body parts, armour, engines, wheels and weapons. Once complete, battle can commence. The game also features a quick-start pick-up-and-play function, so gamers can select from a range of pre-built robots and get straight to the realistic 3-D action in new and improved arenas including desert outpost, sub-zero station, iron foundry and acid factory. <br><br>There are 10 different game types, including robot football and sumo competitions. The RefBot oversees the destruction, while the most popular of the US robots and a range of new competitor robots join the fray. With the use of a link cable, GBA Roboteers can fight one another across the variety of 3-D landscapes; with secret component stores unlocked by successful play, Extreme Destruction includes the ability to trade rare weapons and useful robot body parts with other players, the ultimate goal being to find all the parts to the mythical Gold Robot.
