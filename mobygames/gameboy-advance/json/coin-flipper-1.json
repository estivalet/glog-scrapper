  "description": "<i>Coin Flipper 1</i> is a very small e-Reader application. Gameplay consists of flipping a coin, as the title suggests. The heads side shows a Chansey, and the tails side is blank. A calculator shows you what percentage of the coins landed on which side. The game can go on infinitely, as it keeps track of every coin until exited, but the coins displayed on screen are cleared after ten flips. The coin is already rotating before it is flipped, so the exact moment the button is pressed may affect which side it lands on. The only card required to play this game is Chansey from the Expedition Base Set.",
