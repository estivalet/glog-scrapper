  "description": "Based on the Japan-exclusive traveling exhibition <i>Jurassic Park Institute Tour</i>, this minigame collection has players taking part in five different dinosaur-themed minigames.\n<ul>\n    <li>Cross Dinosaur: A simple <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/frogger\">Frogger</a>-style game. A helicopter lands on the far side of a field, and players have to dodge rampaging dinosaurs to reach it. Each person who reaches the helicopter gives the player 10 points, and the game continues until the player is hit by dinosaurs three times.</li>\n    <li>Danger Zone: A sidescrolling game similar to Cross Dinosaur. Players control a dinosaur moving from the grass on the left side of the screen to a cave on the right while dodging falling rocks propelled from an active volcano.</li>\n    <li>Egg Guard: Players control a mother dinosaur guarding her nest from humans who are coming from all eight directions. Players can scare away egg thieves by facing them straight on, but will lose a life if they let the thief reach the eggs.</li>\n    <li>Rexercise: A &quot;Simon Says&quot;-style game. Players control a dinosaur who must remember sequences of button presses. Every time the player completes a round, players another button is added to the end. The game ends after the player makes three mistakes.</li>\n    <li>Take Meat: Players control a mother dinosaur caring for her child. The nest is on one side of the screen, while some meat is on the other side. From a sidescrolling perspective, players have to make their way to the right side and fetch food, then bring it back safely to the nest while dodging falling rocks.</li>\n</ul>",
