  "description": "Young Tyrogue is serious about his martial arts training. He has arranged a training session where punching bags will pop out of the ground or be dropped from trees for him to attack. <br><br>Move Tyrogue to the left and right while kicking and punching with A &amp; B respectively. Combos can be scored by taking down multiple punching bags with one blow. When Tyrogue is hit by one of the punching bags popping onto the scene the game ends with him clutching his head. Then you are given the option to try and beat your score.<br><br>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Tyrogue (63/147), Marowak (54/147), Hitmonchan (81/147), Hitmontop (82/147), Phanpy (100/147). Or in Japan the Pokemon e-card expansion 2 cards Tyrogue (55/92), Marowak (51/92), Hitmonchan (52/92), Hitmontop (56/92), Phanpy (100/147).",
