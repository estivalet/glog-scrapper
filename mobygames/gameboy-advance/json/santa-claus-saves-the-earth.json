  "description": "It's the night before Christmas, and Santa <i>should</i> be getting ready to deliver presents to children. Unfortunately, the evil fairy Nilam has found out how much people love Santa and she can't stand it - so she kidnaps him and traps him in her evil magical realm. Santa doesn't have long to escape and make it home in time to keep the children of the world happy!<br><br>This sidescrolling platformer has players controlling Sants through fifteen different levels on his way back to the North Pole. Santa can fight his way out using his bag of presents, which he can smack enemies with, and several different kinds of guns with different forms of ammunition. Each mazelike level has a key hidden within it, and Santa has to find it in order to unlock the exit.",
