  "description": "This is the standard &quot;Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her&quot; story. In this case, the Princess is transformed into a ball and launched from a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Super+Mario+64\">Super Mario 64</a>-style cannon, which a pair of goombas aim directly at Bowser's Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her.<br><br>There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a &quot;Time Attack&quot; mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.",
