It is your job to infiltrate the base and stop them by triggering the self-destruct sequence to terminate the moon base and the aliens. <i>BackTrack</i> is a first-person shooter with graphics and gameplay comparable to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Wolfenstein+3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a>. In contrast to the all-time classic it comes with several multiplayer modes like Deathmatch and Matrix Assault. Bots are also supported in multiplayer sessions.",
