  "description": "<i>Tetris CA</i> is a variant of <i>Tetris</i>. The basic gameplay is identical. Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears. If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over. ",
