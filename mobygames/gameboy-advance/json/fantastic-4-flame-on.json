  "description": "Four space pilots - Reed Richards, Sue and Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm - voyage into space on what should have been a routine trip.  But their ship is hit by cosmic rays, and when they return to planet Earth, they are placed in quarantine.  Johnny discovers that he now has the ability to engulf himself in flames and become the Human Torch!<br><br><i>Fantastic 4: Flame On</i> is a side-scrolling platformer for the Game Boy Advance where players exclusively control Johnny Storm - aka The Human Torch.  As The Human Torch, he has an assortment of moves, ranging from flaming dashes, fiery punches, throwing fireballs, and even special moves such as the Supernova and the Inferno.  Special moves can only be activated when the special gauge is full enough - it fills as you destroy enemies.<br><br>Players must fight through levels filled with the Fantastic 4's trademark enemies - the Skrulls.  As you travel through levels, there are crystals to collect for extra points, as well as imprisoned people which the Skrulls have captured.",
