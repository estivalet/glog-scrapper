  "description": "In the third installment of Capcom's Mega Man Zero series, you, unsurprisingly, play as Zero. Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you have to find and neutralize the recently escaped &quot;Dark Elf,&quot; before it's able to brainwash the Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo Arcadia. <br><br>In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new &quot;chip&quot; system, where Zero can gain new abilities by finding chips and installing chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of &quot;Cyber Space&quot; to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many &quot;Secret Disks&quot; (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.",
