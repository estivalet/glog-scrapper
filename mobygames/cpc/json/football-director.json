  "description": "After the success of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Football+Manager\">Football Manager</a>, this was one of the first rival attempts. You can choose any league team to manage, although they always start in the 4th division.<br><br>You will have to hire scouting, physiotherapy and coaching staff before you can do much - you can also hire a youth team for the chance of uncovering a rough diamond. Each week there are up to 2 players available to sign, who are (like your own players) rated out of 10 for form - players with more than 5 will rarely want to play in division 4. Matches are played outside your view, with a minute-by-minute update, and all the other results afterwards.<br><br>Money management is all-important; you can improve your stadium, sell players, take out a loan, and pay for your club's insurance. Injuries and suspensions, as well as cup and eventually European matches, all add to the challenge.",
