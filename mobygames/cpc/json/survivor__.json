  "description": "The setting of <i>Survivor</i> is Deadstone Abbey, a desolate manor house that has been vacant for decades. In it there is a king's random scattered about that has been untouched due to booby traps and the evil forces that live there. An adventurer desperate for money known as Angus is confident that he is skilled enough to get the fortune and escape from the manor alive. Now it's up to the player to navigate Angus through the maze like interiors of the manor and retrieve the treasure.<br><br>Survivor is an action game where the player has to make his way through the seven levels of the mansion which has 1008 rooms in total. In each room spirits wander around that the player can shoot or just sneak past. The player can move in all directions but only shoot right and left. A spirit is killed with a single bullet but more respawn constantly. In addition to the standard gun it's also possible to use a porcupine bomb that frightens all nearby enemies. Treasure such as coins and rings are scattered all around and by collecting it, as well as killing spirits, the player earns points. As the player takes damage when in contact with spirits he also needs to find bottles of life giving elixir that replenishes his strength. It's also necessary to look out for ammunition for the gun as it is limited. <br><br>The objective of each level is to clear a certain number of bombs. In some rooms there are signposts that show the direction to the nearest bomb. The number of bombs increases with each level and the enemies get harder to avoid and frighten.",
