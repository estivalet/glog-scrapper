  "description": "The evil Goblin has used his magical abilities to ensnare all the toys in the neighborhood to go into his underground lair. Thing bounces to the rescue, and resolves to retrieve them from his 4 storey underground lair. To do this he must collect 9 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle on each floor.<br><br>Needless to say, Goblin has not made things easy - a myriad of traps await our intrepid hero. There are traps all over, some crucial areas are guarded by switches, and the last of these switches locks the level-ending lift.<br><br><i>Thing on a Spring</i> is a platform game, made unusual by Thing's motion method. He can bounce to reach great heights, and be bounced off platforms strategically to reach higher platforms. You have limited oil, which is lost through contact with the many nasties you will encounter.",
