He conquered the industrial city of Atlantis, and is now preparing to take over the world. The United Nations decided to retaliate by sending two of their top class Special Forces officers, Ben and Andy, infiltrate the city and destroy the enemy base using a newly developed time bomb--Sigma.<br><br><i>Crack Down</i> is a time-limited action game.
