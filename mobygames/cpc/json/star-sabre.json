  "description": "Humans have colonized hundreds of planetary systems but have only found the ruins of other extraterrestrial civilizations. All we can do is archaeologically sift through them to learn of their past. While on a routine survey mission, you pick up a distress signal from the nearby xenoarchaeological site. Your space folding drive sends you to a scene of devastation. Extraterrestrial life has been found but they do not come in peace.<br><br><i>Star Sabre</i> is a side-scrolling space shoot-'em-up. Enemies approach you in waves, sometimes firing at you. You must shoot these enemies while avoiding getting shot. Halfway through the levels is a mid-boss ship and at the end is a boss. If you see a green pod, shoot it then grab the  weapons upgrade.<br><br>The 128k 3&quot; disk version contains enhancements like additional enemies as well as tokens for bonus points if all enemies in a wave are killed.",
