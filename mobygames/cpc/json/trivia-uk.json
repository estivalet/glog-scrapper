  "description": "<i>Trivia UK</i> is a computer quiz game based on the board game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/trivial-pursuit\">Trivial Pursuit</a> where you have to move around a board from two to four players answering questions on six subjects on various small squares. The categories are Entertainment, History, Sport &amp; Leisure, Geography, Arts &amp; Literature and Science &amp; Nature and each subject is coloured coded. The aim is to collect six pieces before your opponents, one from each subject by answering a question correctly on a large square for each category. The squares go round the edge of the board and you can move either left or right. A dice is thrown to see how many squares you can move and if you answer correctly then you move again, the next player moves if you answer incorrectly. You have to say the answer out loud and tell the computer if the answer was right or wrong.",
