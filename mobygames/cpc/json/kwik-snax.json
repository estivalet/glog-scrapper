  "description": "Dizzy must rescue four of his 'Yolkfolk' (groan) chums in this game, from Cuckoo Land, Ice Land, Cloud Land and Zak's Castle.  Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Fast+Food%27%27\">Fast Food</a> it doesn't directly resemble <moby game='Dizzy'>the main series of arcade adventures, instead being a single-screen action game, resembling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pengo%27\">Pengo</a>. The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.",
