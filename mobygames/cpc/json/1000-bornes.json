  "description": "<i>1000 Bornes</i> is a licensed computer conversion of the card game Mille Bornes that can be played by one player against an AI opponent. The game uses keyboard controls where a cursor is used to select the cards that should be played. Like the original card game the player has seven cards and can use one in each turn. There are three options in each turn: to the play a card, to discard a card or to do a coup fourré.<br><br>The objective of the game is to reach 5000 points which is earned by competing in races where each race is 700 kilometres. Driving ahead is done by playing distance cards but they can only be played if a green lights card has been played first. To prevent a player from moving it's possible to play a hazard such as flat tire or out of gas. To start moving again the player needs to play the corresponding remedy card. There are also safety cards that give immunity to hazard cards.",
