  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marble-madness\">Marble Madness</a> involved guiding a ball through precarious levels with drops, ramps, and enemies to avoid for fear of losing time or being sent back to the start of a screen. The initial home licensing was split – <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Electronic+Arts\">Electronic Arts</a> converted the arcade game itself to several systems, whilst <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Melbourne+House\">Melbourne House</a> provided their own level set, but more significantly designed an environment allowing players to create their own levels.<br><br>Angled and slanted ramps can be placed anywhere, either on a blank screen or to edit an existing level. Enemies can be placed anywhere, these will follow their own paths once you play the game. Time / points bonuses and oil slicks can also be added to the levels. A complete block of levels can be saved to create a game set of its own. Designs can be tested out before being committed to storage.",
