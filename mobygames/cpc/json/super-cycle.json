  "description": "A motorbike racing game strongly resembling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Sega\">Sega's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Hang-On\">Hang-On</a> titles. The game is viewed from behind the bike, which tilts as you turn. You are racing against the clock, although there are lots of other bikes on track to avoid and ride around. There are 3 skill levels, which affect the amount of time you have to complete the level, and the bonus offered if you manage to (the amount of time left, divided by a set number, bigger on lower levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many tokens as possible in the time limit.",
