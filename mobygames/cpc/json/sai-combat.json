  "description": "Sai Combat features real-life combat, in the Japanese style of Sai Karate AKA Kendo. The difference from standard karate is the presence of a large stick for each player, which is used to inflict much of the damage. Your challenge in a one-player game is to progress through the Belts and Dans, by winning every fight. Each hit scores you points depending on how tough a maneuver it is deemed to be- three hits must be impacted to move up a level. A player's energy level, or Chi, is depicted by a white dragon turning green or red as weakened.",
