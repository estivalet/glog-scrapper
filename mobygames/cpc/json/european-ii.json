  "description": "<i>European 2</i> is a football management game in which the player takes on the European Cup in its old form as a pure knock-out competition. There are seven skill levels, which determine the quality of the player's team - alternatively each player's abilities specifically can be typed in.  The player can also import saved squads from the same company's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/premier-2-superleague\">Premier 2</a>, as the systems used in both games are identical.<br><br>Before each match the player is shown each team's Goal Scoring Ability, which gives him some idea of how a match is likely to unfold. Full European rules on disciplinary points are included, as are away goals and penalty shoot-outs to decide ties which are level after the 2 matches.",
