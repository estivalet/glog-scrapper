  "description": "<i>3D Stunt Rider</i> is a single player game. The objective in this game is to jump a motorcycle over a number of double decker London buses in an attempt to set a world record.<br><br>The player has one minute to make their jump. In that minute they must complete the following stages of the jump:<ul>\n<li>The Approach - which involves accelerating through the gears and steer towards the middle of the ramp. This becomes more difficult at higher levels when side winds blow the bike off course</li>\n<li>In the Air - the flight is viewed from a side-on perspective and the player can alter their flight by 'leaning' forwards or backwards</li>\n<li>Landing - the final phase, success here depends upon the angle of approach</li></ul>\nPoints for a successful jump are awarded with a 1000 bonus for a successful landing.<br><br>The game is controlled via the keyboard or via the joystick",
