  "description": "A sequel to the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Grand+Prix+Simulator\">Grand Prix Simulator</a>, a popular Super Sprint style racing game.<br><br>As before, the action is viewed from overhead across a succession of tracks featuring hairpins, oil slicks and similar hazards. You must complete each race within the time limit; and time left after one race is added to your allowance on the next one. After the race you can view a replay.<br><br>The two main new features are a 3-player mode (there are always 3 cars present in total) and a damage meter which mean that repeat contract with barriers or other cars hampers your performance.
