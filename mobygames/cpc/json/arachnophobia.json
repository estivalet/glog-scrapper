  "description": "This simple action game is based on the Hollywood movie <i>Arachnophobia</i>.<br><br>South American spiders have overrun a large area in some areas of the United States. It's your task to clean the infested farms, houses or public buildings by using an very effective pesticide called &quot;Toxi-Max&quot;. One of the most useful devices your character can use is an arachno-detector indicating approaching vermin.\nThe player sprite is controlled from a side-view and basically only needs to use his toxic pesticide in time to defend himself from attacking spiders, just like a simple reaction game.",
