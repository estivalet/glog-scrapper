  "description": "With full graphics throughout, <i>Heavy on the Magick</i> aimed the standard adventure style at a wider audience. Axil the Able is stuck in Collodon's pile, and he must find a way out. At the start, the game will randomly generate his Skill, Stamina and Luck - you can regenerate these if you don't like the initial values. As you play your experience statistic will increase.<br><br>The graphics are created in memory before being copied onto the screen; this causes some pixellated areas, but there's a full examine option with some helpful hints as to the item's benefit/risk.<br><br>The lair is on many levels, and most rooms have multiple exits across the 8 compass directions. Vampires and Werewolves are among the many creatures which guard the corridors - you use magic to kill or freeze these, although some can be beaten back by possessing certain objects.",
