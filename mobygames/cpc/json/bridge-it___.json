  "description": "<i>Bridge-It</i> is a single player puzzle game which can be played by keyboard of joystick.<br><br>The game is quite simple. There are two houses connected by a walkway. On the walkway are a series of four bridges. People walk between these houses and, unless the bridges are closed they will fall, lemming like, into the water below. However the bridges do not stay closed for more than a second or two so timing and fast reflexes are crucial.<br><br>The player can start the game at any of its nine levels of difficulty, the game at each level is identical but the period between each walker is reduced. The player can also make the game more difficult by increasing the number of lives, or how many walkers can fall to their doom before the game is over, to any number between 1 and 50. <br><br>The player is entertained by music while playing the game, and this can be toggled on or off during play.<br><br>",
