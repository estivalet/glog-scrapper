  "description": "Ocean Software released three different games based on the Sylvester Stallone action vehicle <i>Cobra</i>. The CPC version unleashes macho cop Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti onto the streets to protect fashion model Ingrid from the psychotic Night Slasher and his army of goons in eight side-scrolling levels. <br><br>All eight stages actually take place on the same (very long) game map; only the starting location differs. In each level, the goal is to meet a kill quota: a certain number of enemies must be taken out to advance automatically to the next stage. Enemies come running along the street, hide in trash cans or shoot from windows, armed with throwing knives, machine guns or rocket launchers. Also present: dive-bombing ducks(!). Cobra can take a few hits before he loses a life; an extra one is awarded every 10.000 points.<br><br>At the start, Cobra is unarmed and must punch out the bad guys, but some enemies leave behind hamburgers that when picked up give one of three weapon power-ups: a machine gun, a pistol or a throwing knife, each with only limited energy, which can be refilled by collecting another hamburger.<br><br>Starting in level three, Ingrid will appear and Cobra must follow and protect her. She can't be harmed though, at least until level six, when the Night Slasher appears. Failing to protect Ingrid means the loss of a life.",
