  "description": "If you had dreams to be a bird, this game will make them true. Here you are a Birdie in some sci-fi world filled with robots, carnivorous plants, parachutes, raptors, barbarians, lasers, butterflies, magical doors, hyperspace, etc. You should survive in this world with help of your wings and flying techniques.<br><br>The game is flown in third-person view, where you may control a bird moving him/her left or right, flying up or descending down, and flapping the wings. To fly correctly, the bird has to move in the air at a certain speed. Once the latter increases, the bird is handy. If bird's speed drops below a certain threshold, the bird then follows one of the oldest laws of the universe, gravity. Flapping wings enables bird to gain altitude and flying down on the wings increases speed.<br><br>The scoreboard on the screen tells you your speed (red = stall), altitude, the remaining time before the night, your life energy (no energy = game over). Flying at altitude for too long will attract predators, give no points, and exhaust the energy unnecessarily. Eating butterflies allows you to recover energy, but remember that eating too much makes you aggressive!<br><br>The environment, where Birdie is flying, will change during the game. Starting in the forest, you will visit other dimensions through Magical Doors as well as descend the dungeons, and even meet lamas.",
