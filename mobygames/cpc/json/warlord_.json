  "description": "In the middle of the first century, the Romans were sweeping across Britain, defeating the various tribes and taking control of the island. The further North they got, the harder it became until they reached the border between England and Scotland and were halted in their tracks. No matter how hard they tried they just couldn't defeat the Scottish tribes led by a Northern warlord. As the fighting intensified, the Gods of both sides got involved until the ferocity of the armies and the Gods was so intense that the end of the world was imminent. A truce was called between the Gods and the solution was to take a champion from each side and transport them both to a Celtic Otherworld. The aim now was for each champion to attempt to get back to the real world before the other one to be declared the winner. You as the Warlord was chosen for the Celts, while a centurion for the Romans was picked to try to beat you back.<br><br><i>Warlord</i> is a graphic text adventure where the screen has a picture to show what you can see while text describes each location. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.",
