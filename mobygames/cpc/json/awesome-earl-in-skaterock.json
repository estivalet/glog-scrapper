  "description": "Skate Rock is a side-scroller similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Paperboy\">Paperboy</a>, only on a skateboard.  You must navigate the streets and sidewalks, collecting flags before the time runs out to complete each level, dodging pedestrians, cars, and obstacles along the way.  If and when you make it through all 10 levels, you will at last join the coveted ranks of the Slime Rat Skaters!<br><br>Skate Rock was one of the earliest skateboarding video games, capturing the feel of 80s street skateboarding.",
