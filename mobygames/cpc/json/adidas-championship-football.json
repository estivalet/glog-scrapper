  "description": "<i>Adidas Championship Football</i> is a soccer game with 24 national teams. The only playing mode is a championship which mimics the World Cup with randomly drawn groups. A second player can control a second team.<br><br>The playing perspective is top-down with a scrolling field. The control method is an expanded dribbling method known from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Kick+Off\">Kick Off</a> series. To make a shot, the player needs to hold down the button for a certain amount of time (this determines the power of the shot) and only then play the ball. The angle can be changed by tapping the button.",
