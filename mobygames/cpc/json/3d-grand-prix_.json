  "description": "<i>3D Grand Prix</i> is a Formula 1 racing game that uses a first person perspective from the driver's seat. The game contains eight race tracks that are based on real life circuits such as Zanduoort, Silverstone and Anderstorp. The first race is at Silverstone in the BBC version and at Zanduoort in the Amstrad version. To advance to the next race it is necessary to finish in a top four position in the BBC version and a top three position in the Amstrad version. Each race consists of three laps. The game can be played with keyboard or joystick and uses manual transmission. In the cockpit the player can see driving information including rev counter, temperature gauge and speed while the wing mirrors show opponents advancing from behind. Wing mirrors can not be seen in the BBC Micro version.",
