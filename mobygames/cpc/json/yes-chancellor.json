  "description": "<i>Yes Chancellor!</i> is a simulation game about the British economy that puts the player in charge as the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The aim of the game is to stay in power long enough to win three elections and be awarded a life peerage. The player decides how to spend on defence, law and order, education and social welfare, sets tax levels and bank rates and deals with unions, who if their wage claims are not met might start striking. The game is text based and the player enters data year by year and then gets feedback on how the policies are received before moving on to the next year.",
