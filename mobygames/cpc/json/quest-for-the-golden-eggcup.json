  "description": "<i>The Quest for the Golden Eggcup</i> is a humorous, single player, text adventure.<br><br>The game doesn't have a grand back story about wizards and magic, instead it starts with the player standing in the middle of the motorway and being hit by a pink Citroen C5 driven by a very pink, pink panther. Naturally they get run down and are killed immediately whereupon they meet God who gives the player their quest, which is to find his treasured golden egg cup or else there will be dire consequences.<br><br>The player's progress is recorded both as a score and in the number of turns taken.<br><br><br><br>",
