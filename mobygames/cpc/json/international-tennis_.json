  "description": "International Tennis lets up to four players play tennis on three different courts (grass, clay and asphalt), each with their own ball bounce. The game can be played using different match variations. You can play singles with men (five sets) or women (three sets) or play mixed with both in doubles. You can choose to take control of all players or choose a cpu-vs-cpu match. The action is seen from a third person perspective as standard is with tennis games. ",
