  "description": "<i>The Race Against Time</i> is a game based on Sport Aid '88, a global program of sport, music, and carnival, cultivating in the simultaneous 10km world-wide run that took place on September 11, 1988. Millions of people around the world joined the campaign to help children worldwide by fighting hunger, poverty, and disease.<br><br>Players take on the role of Omar Khalifa, the legendary Sudanese athlete who has decided to participate. Starting from the El Mowheli relief camp in Sudan, he has limited time to raise a flag and light a flame in each of the six continents. Khalifa's journey has him pass famous landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, the United Nations, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Mt. Rushmore, the Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum, and the Eiffel Tower. There are multiple routes on each continent.<br><br>Khalifa can pick up objects to help him reach places, but only one object can be carried at a time. He can also get an hourglass which will give him more time. The run is over when Khalifa runs out of time or when he comes into contact with dangers he must face.",
