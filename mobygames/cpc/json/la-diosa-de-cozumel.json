  "description": "The scene chosen for this adventure, the first one of the &quot;Ci-U-Than&quot; trilogy, is the Yucatan, a mysterious land in which legends say there are a lot of dangers, hidden treasures, unsolved mysteries, temples filled with traps... in short, the ingredients to which the good adventurer is used to deal with.<br><br>The adventure is developed in the island of Cozumel, where you must guide an archaeologist who had an incident. He was sailing towards it perfectly equipped, when an unfortunate shipwreck left him without anything. Do not think he only lost the map or the machete, no, he lost everything, including the trousers and the underclothes, reason why it's quite possible that an entrance in San Marcos, coastal town near the place of the shipwreck, would carry serious problems with the justice. The main mission of the adventure is to discover all the hidden secrets of the island and then be able to escape from it.<br><br>This game uses the habitual commands of the previous AD adventures, plus the inclusion of some PSI characters, it means, personages with own personality, decision capacity, different behavior according to the development of the adventure, that is, personages who must be treated as if they were real since their reactions can vary from a game to another. Some improvements like the objects treatment system have been incorporated (which include all their qualities); a better graphical detail; a score system that it indicates you which actions are positive and which negative, etc.",
