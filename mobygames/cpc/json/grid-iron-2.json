  "description": "This (American) football management game uses a menu-driven system. There are 16 teams to choose from; the Dolphins, Packers and 49ers are all in there. Players are rated out of 10 on skill, energy and form. Player trading is handled in a soccer-style transfer market, rather than with a US 'draft' format - mid-season trades for money are common. Matches have no direct tactical input, and are viewed from remote highlight shots, which do not have the distinct pitch markings of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/american-football\">the original</a> (an old <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Softstone\">Softstone</a> game released under three different names).",
