  "description": "This game was made just short of the 100th anniversary of England's most notorious serial killer, who gruesomely murdered at least five women in 1888. After accidentally killing someone, you become a suspect. You must prove that you are innocent, without the police hauling you in as they search for a scapegoat.<br><br><i>Jack the Ripper</i> is interactive fiction with occasional graphics, based closely on real events of the Ripper. The parser accepts full sentences, and instructions can be qualified with adverbs such as 'slowly' and 'quietly'. The game is played in real time and time will pass even when the player is not making a move.  The game is split into three parts, including digitised graphics (of the author's sisters) representing Ripper victims.<br><br>The game was created with the Professional Adventure Writing System by Gilsoft.",
