  "description": "A Flunky is a male servant who must do routine jobs for his masters; in this game you are a Flunky and your masters are the British Royal Family. There are five tasks to be undertaken – light all the fires, fetching a toy boat from the bath for Prince Andrew, some freckles for Fergie, a wig for Diana, and a mystery task for the Queen. To gain access to each room, you need the signatures of particular royals along the way. <br><br><i>Flunky</i> is an arcade adventure using the same game system as other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,185732/\">Don Priestley</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/trap-door\">Trapdoor</a> license – large sprites overlaid onto block objects, seemingly designed around Spectrum attribute-clash issues. Many screens operate on more than 1 horizontal plane, so you can move your character in and out of the screens as well as across them. Guards will shoot at you if you attempt to access restricted areas, so be careful.",
