  "description": "<i>Phantomas Tales #1: Marsport</i> is a game based on the 1986 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phantomas\">Phantomas</a> starring the android thief protagonist of the same name. In this game he traces an ancient civilization rumoured to own massive quantities of gold in their caves on Mars. He was supposed to retire on the planet Novgorod, but unexpectedly intercepts communication that leads him to the caves. The goal of the game is to collect 20 gold canisters and then the game ends right away.<br><br>This 2D platform game consists of several single-screen rooms linked both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic to form a single, large level with some freedom for exploration. Phantomas can only move and jump, he has no means to attack. He needs to avoid enemies and hazards such as acid wells and rocks. He has access to two types of jumps, a high one and a long one. Both are needed to complete the platforming sections. He starts with 255 health and that is drained as soon as he comes in contact with an enemy or a hazard. Every now and then battery pick-ups can be found to restore some energy.<br><br>For ZX Spectrum there are two versions. The 128K version contains AY music and sound effects, as well as a comic as an introduction to the game. The 48K version uses a different set of graphics and the regular machine sound. There is also a separate version of the game with a red sky and no further changes.",
