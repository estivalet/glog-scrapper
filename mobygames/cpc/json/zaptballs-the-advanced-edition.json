  "description": "The full version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zaptballs\">Zap't'Balls</a> continues in the same colourful vein, and with the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pang\">Pang</a>-styled gameplay. <br><br>This time, Ramses and Columbus have five new worlds to shoot their way through, beginning with the &quot;cuddly testworld&quot;. Each new world is unlockable via a password. The levels may contain ladders and elaborate platform installations to climb, but you cannot jump. On some levels, your beam is very short, which requires you to take great risks when trying to zap the balls.",
