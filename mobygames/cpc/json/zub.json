  "description": "<i>Zub</i> is a cartoon platform game, the first title developed by the brothers <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,34061/\">Ste Pickford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=John+Pickford\">John Pickford</a> as a team. In a humorous twist, every creature in the game is named Zub, including the main character. The player controls Zub, an alien warrior that received a mission from his Emperor Zub of the Zub galactic empire: to retrieve the Green Eye of Zub, a powerful artifact.<br><br>Zub must ride the intergalactic elevators to reach other planets and continue the search for the Eye. The worlds are very empty, featuring a few platforms and sparsely populated by dangerous monsters called Zubs. Zub must hop to the existing platforms, position them next to each other, and keep jumping and alternating between them to ascend to the top of the level and move to the next planet. The Zubs float around the scene following the hero, trying to touch and drain some of the health energy, and have to be killed with the laser gun.",
