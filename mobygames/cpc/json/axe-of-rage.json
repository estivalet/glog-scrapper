  "description": "In the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/death-sword\">Barbarian / Death Sword</a>, the Wizard Drax is back after your previous defeat of him. But this time, you're not alone. The princess you saved back then has taken up a sword and joined your cause! Now, it's more than a death match. You have to explore the many tunnels in his dungeon, defeat the dangerous monsters that come between you and put cold steel to Drax's throat.<br><br>The game has similar game play to the original, but with a different challenge. Various monsters will come and attack you, but you'll need to use different approaches in order to defeat each of them. For example, you can't overhead chop a monster that's shorter than your axe. There are 4 dungeon levels to explore before you reach Drax at the final stage.",
