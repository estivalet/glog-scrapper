  "description": "Captain C T Cobra has the task of travelling through planet Mergatron where the jewels of Ozymandias have been placed by their captors. The road is long and tough but he has a Battlecar at his disposal.<br><br>You play Cobra as he journeys vertically, taking out the mounted turrets and enemy cars as he goes. There are also colored turrets to shoot at - each colour represents a particular change to your car's performance (there are a few temporary negative ones alongside the upgrades). You have 16 smart bombs, which may sound generous, but just watch them go. A boss must be beaten at the end of each level.",
