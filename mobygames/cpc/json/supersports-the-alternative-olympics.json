  "description": "<i>Supersports: The Alternative Olympics</i> is a sports game with five humorous disciplines which are played one after another. At the end the player with the most points wins. The disciplines are:\n<ul><li>Crack Shot is similar to skeet shooting, just on a back alley with cans as targets. Shooting a cat gives minus points.</li>\n<li>Dare Devil Dive is reminiscent to a circus attraction: jumping from a high pole (three heights) into a water pub. Points are also rewarded for performing moves during the fall.</li>\n<li>Slate Smash involves smashing slates with the bare hands.</li>\n<li>Cross Bow is a regular target shooting discipline. The player needs to set the position of the crossbow and the shooting power while taking the wind direction into account.</li>\n<li>Under Water Assault Course is an underwater obstacle course. Collecting coins rewards extra points.</li></ul>",
