  "description": "In this intergalactic 3D action-flight-simulation your mission is to save the Rubicon, an constructed anti-matter zone that was made by the alliance of the eight planets of the Hyturian system. In 2746 after many centuries of war between the eight planets of the system, they decided to build up this anti-matter zone around the entire system as protection against each others. It worked fine for several decades - the peace remained unthreatened. But now the time has come that the Rubicon barrier has been breached, by the entry of a new planet and its hostile home race, the Space Thugs. Enter your <i>Starfox</i> fighter, save the whole system, and find out who breached the system.<br><br>The action is viewed from the cockpit of your starfighter, which is equipped with lasers and side/rear-view mirrors. It also has a status log detailing your weapons and current threats, and an advanced 3-dimensional navigation system called the Holocube. Controlled from a separate screen, the Holocube allows you to rotate a 3D image of space and plot the co-ordinates of your journey. <br><br>The player must manually navigate through wormholes for fast travel - contact with the edges drains your shield. Electrical and ion storms are a constant hazard - the easiest way to avoid these is to use the general log to note their co-ordinates. Weapons can be upgraded<br><br><i>Starfox</i> features eight missions to be completed in order. The first is to shoot down 60 Space Thugs.",
