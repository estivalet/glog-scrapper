  "description": "Take over managing a European international football team in this budget game. An initial team of 11 players and 2 substitutes is selected automatically for you from the roster of 24 squad members and another 16 'hopefuls', but you can move these at will. You can choose your team's formation, playing style and tactics, to give you a fighting chance of qualifying from the 4-team groups to reach the major championships. Team training must also be organised. <br><br>On the ZX Spectrum during the match you can see which part of the pitch the ball is in <i>(<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Premier+Manager\">Premier Manager</a></i> later used a similar system) as well as updates on key moments. On the C64 and Amstrad CPC version the match screen is just shown in text. ",
