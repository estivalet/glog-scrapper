  "description": "<i>Super Skweek</i> is a game inspired by the wide success of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/chips-challenge\">Chip's Challenge</a>, and shares some elements of that puzzler while combining other elements from games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pengo\">Pengo</a>.<br><br>In Super Skweek, you play the title character who must walk around and either paint all the tiles of the game board pink, complete a specific mission, or both.  Some tiles react in various ways when you walk on them, like exploding.  <br><br>Unlike Chip's Challenge, the game plays in realtime and you can pick up and use weapons to keep away certain monsters as you paint the tiles.  There is also a shop you can enter to purchase items.  Finally, levels have a time limit for completion.",
