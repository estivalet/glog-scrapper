  "description": "<i>Revolution</i> is an action game with puzzle elements. The player controls a jumping ball in eight isometric levels and has to solve four (randomly distributed) puzzles in each. The principle is easy: There are two red blocks which belong together: touching one causes it to glow for a few seconds and during this time the other one has to touched, too. They may be in different height positions or move and the puzzle is to work out how to reach both in time. <br><br>This is made more complicated by roaming enemies, which have to be avoided, and different grounds which may cause acceleration or breaking. The player can change how much energy the ball uses for jumping; this directly influences the height and bounce energy. Directions can't be changed mid-flight.  The player is given 5 lives and must also contend with a time limit which becomes progressively shorter as each level is conquered. ",
