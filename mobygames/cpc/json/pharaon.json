  "description": "An unusual adventure game that mixes interactive fiction, arcade, and puzzles.\nAs a professor of archaeology at Washington University, we discover that an ancient Egyptian pharaoh named Acktheon had possessed 'the formula for antimatter' buried with him in his tomb - and out task is to get to that treasure before other colleagues, starting in Cairo and traveling to Giza and to Abu Simbel through the desert.\nDespite the limited palette (CGA in PC version), the game utilizes digitized pictures. The commands are to be entered using the keyboard, although some of them, the most commonly used, are represented also by icons that could be activated with the cursor keys. There are two mini-games present as well - a small 'Space Invaders' clone and a timed maze puzzle.",
