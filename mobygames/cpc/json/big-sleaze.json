  "description": "<i>The Big Sleaze</i> is a humorous text adventure which parodies the detective genre. It is set in the late 1930s and the player controls Sam Spillade, a stereotypical and not too bright private detective. The adventure begins when he gets a new assignment: finding the missing father of his pretty, female client. <br><br>The situations Spillade has to solve shift between standard problems, e.g. getting money, and absurd situations like an auto bomb placed by the neighbour's children. And why did a dog bring a check and a photograph into his office? Commands have to be typed in with the keyboard, but the parser only understand simple verb + noun combinations. In compensation, Spillard can make conversation to other people.<br><br>The game consists of three independent programmes which have to solved in linear order - the save game of the previous part has to be imported into the next. Also included is the satirical electronic magazine <i>Sceptical 3</i>. ",
