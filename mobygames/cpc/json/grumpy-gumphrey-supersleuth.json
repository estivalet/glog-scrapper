  "description": "Gilbert Gumphrey is a veteran store detective, whose tasks range from the complex to the mundane. They include putting out fires, rescuing children, killing ducks, and getting the boss his afternoon cup of tea. Failure to do any of these successfully can lead to the sack.<br><br><i>Grumpy Gumphrey Supersleuth</i> is made up of 39 screens of puzzles. Each room is viewed in forced-perspective 3D, and the perspective of a room is not always the same as the perspective you entered it – however the initial movement into the main space of the room is automated. A task is dictated to you at the base of the screen, with instruction on where to find the objects you need. Watch out for an umbrella, keys and a skateboard among other things. You can hold multiple objects, cycling through them with the 'S' key.",
