  "description": "<i>Rally Simulator</i> is a driving game where you compete against three other drivers to complete three laps over three different circuits. Each circuit is like a maze so to guide you round the correct route you must follow the arrows on the road. If you stray too far from the correct route then it is game over as well as running out of fuel or taking too much damage which occurs if you hit the sides or the other drivers. On each circuit there is a repair or fueling station. If you complete the three laps then it is onto the next circuit.<br><br><i>Rally Simulator</i> is viewed from above with a small section of the circuit shown which scrolls when you move. As well as the main playing area you can also see number of laps completed, your rivals laps, a map of the circuit which highlights as you go and lastly fuel and damage gauges.<br><br>",
