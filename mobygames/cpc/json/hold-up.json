  "description": "You are a hold-up man driving a fast red car in a French town with narrow streets. The armoured van with bags of money is also somewhere in this town. So you must find it using your radar and collect the money. Gendarmerie (French Police) knows about you and wants to cancel your mission by killing you, so you also must avoid them, or to make a good getaway by dropping oil spots on the road. During your driving the fuel is used up, so you have to re-fill the tank at the gas station.",
