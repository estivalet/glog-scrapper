The bomb has been fitted with a short delay fuse and carefully hidden somewhere in the town of Foggly. On hearing of this the Government has despatched a Bomb Disposal Expert to find and defuse the device.<br><br>The town has already been evacuated so the officer can move around the shops and house freely with the knowledge that there is only 30 minutes left to detonation and devastation.<br><br>Due to his sudden call up he finds he is a few tools short to complete his job so even if he does find the bomb, he must have the tools to remove the detonator to render it harmless. Can he find it in time?",
