  "description": "In the distant future, the continued existence of the human race is in grave danger. Uncanny diseases, which were previously unknown, are rampant among humans and claim many victims. The plant world mutated and for unknown reasons, a deadly green carpet grows over the land. Fear and terror prevail among the already decimated humanity. It seems as if nature has conspired against man and is now striving to wipe him from the face of the earth for good. A small group of survivors saves themselves on a secluded island in the Saragossa-Sea, where life is still possible without dangers and dangers. There the refugees discover the remains of a lost culture. An ancient prophecy has been engraved on the stone tablets, which tells of a blue crystal whose mysterious power could save mankind from destruction. But the only clue to the place where this crystal is said to be is a clue to an underground temple. This chance, however small it may be, must of course not go unused. And so the strongest, bravest and most intelligent is chosen. Thus begins an adventurous odyssey above and below the lonely island, in the vastness of the mysterious  Saragossa-Sea.<br><br>",
