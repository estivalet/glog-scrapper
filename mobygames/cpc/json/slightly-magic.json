  "description": "<i>Slightly Magic</i> is a platform game not unlike Codemasters' own <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Dizzy\">Dizzy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Seymour\">Seymour</a> series, but is generally shorter and easier than most other games of that genre.<br><br>In <i>Slightly Magic</i> you are cast as Slightly - mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and magical spells running amok. One of the dragons kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save her.<br><br>In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy games, <i>Slightly Magic</i> introduces a magic system that requires multiple objects to be combined in order to achieve effects ranging from frightening the enemies to turning the player into a fish.",
