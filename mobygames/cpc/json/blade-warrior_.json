  "description": "In <i>Blade Warrior</i>, a flick-screen platform game, the titular hero must lay an undead demon to rest by finding the demon's skull and bringing it to an altar. Despite his name, the warrior cannot use his blade and can instead only evade the various enemies or lose a life upon touching them. His quest must be completed within 10 minutes. Before he can deliver the skull, a number of other items must be found and picked up in a certain order. What item to collect next is shown on the screen. The game features sampled speech upon dying or successfully collecting an item.",
