  "description": "La Mancha, Spain, April of 1605...<br><br>You are Don Alonso Quijano, a Manchegan nobleman (hidalgo, more concretely) of the XVI century, whose soft spot is the cavalry novels. Everything goes more or less fine in your house, until one day your madness reaches the culminating point: you decide to take the arms and go out to travel through La Mancha. You obtain a shield-bearer, Sancho Panza, who, although not being the best on the field, will help you in the hardest situations. From this very moment you will be participant of the most incredible adventures you have ever imagined. Winds, hills, forests and inns will be witnesses of your craziest ideas such as attacking mills or challenging fierce lions, but before that, you must equipe yourself like a brave cavalier.<br><br>Your final objective, like in the novel, will be to find your beloved and infinitely appreciated, Dulcinea del Toboso.",
