  "description": "Baron Greenback has created a clone of Danger Mouse, and needless to say his intentions are not good. Naturally, Danger Mouse springs into action, across three distinct stages of gameplay with platform and shoot 'em up elements.<br><br>The first section involves flying to the jungle in your Aerocar, shooting as many of the bad guys as possible while avoiding as many as possible. The second is set in the jungle and involves avoiding contact with wild cats and monkeys by jumping on the backs of crocodiles. The final section set in the enemy base involves destroying the power apparatus of Greenback's doppelganger in time to save Penfold. This involves copying a sequence of colour lights.",
