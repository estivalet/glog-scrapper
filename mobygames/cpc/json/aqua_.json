  "description": "<i>Aqua</i> is a 2D game somewhat similar to the concept of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bubble-ghost\">Bubble Ghost</a>. The player controls an air bubble and needs to safely guide it to the surface. Starting underwater there are 20 levels or single screen rooms that need to be completed. Once the bubble starts to move it keeps moving at a steady speed, so the player constantly needs to adjust the movement as it is not possible to hold still completely anymore until the next screen is reached. Along the way typical underwater elements need to be avoided such as rocks, walls, crabs, fishes and so on. The bubble has a health meter and every collision removes a part of it.",
