  "description": "<i>Return to Doom</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/countdown-to-doom\">Countdown to Doom</a>. The planet of Doomawangara once again plays host to a sci-fi exploration adventure - this time, a rescue mission.  As the only adventurer ever known to survive that perilous world (if you've played the first game, that is), it is only fitting that you would be the one receiving a distress signal from a ship that has just crash-landed there. <br><br>What's more, aboard the fallen ship is an important ambassador on a diplomatic mission.  Sensing the urgency of the matter, you set your controls towards that unforgiving planet; the signal has been traced to somewhere in the vicinity of a dense and forbidding jungle, and you luckily manage to locate a clearing suitable for landing.  Once again you set foot on Doom's surface, steeling yourself for the fiendish environment with its innumerable deadly puzzles.",
