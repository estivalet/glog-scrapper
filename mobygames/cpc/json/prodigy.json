Solo the Synthelman must lead Nejo the baby out of this nightmare and to safety.<br><br>There are four worlds to get through, Ice Zone, VegieZone, Tech Zone and Fire Zone. These are linked via teleports and all full of nasties to fend off and protect Nejo from. The Ice Zone contains oxygen bubbles which must be popped to keep you breathing well. Nejo needs feeding and taking to the showers regularly.<br><br>The game is viewed isometrically and smoothly scrolls, unlike other isometric games of the day.",
