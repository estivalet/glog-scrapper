  "description": "<i>Rex</i> the dinosaur is fed up of the environmental damage being done by a nearby nuclear plant. As a result, he takes to the heavily-guarded tunnels that lead to it, with the intention of ridding the world of nuclear power forever.<br><br>The game is viewed from the side in a flick-screen format. Rex jumps and shoots, staking out various walking and flying enemies. Walking on to a Beam Pad means that upon losing a life, you will resume from the screen on which you died. As enemies are dying, keep shooting at them to keep increasing your score.<br><br>There are power-ups to collect, through energy bubbles. Each weapon has 5 possible energy levels, and can only be used if you have enough. Collect a bubble when you weapon is at the top level and you will collect an improved weapon. ",
