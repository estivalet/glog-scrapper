  "description": "<i>Punch &amp; Judy</i> is a side-view flick-screen game based on the famous puppet characters where you control Punch who has to find all the parts for his tent before finding the cast members. The game is set in the English town of Bridlington in the summer of 89 and you move around the streets looking for the parts and cast members before the tide comes in shown by a small graphic. As well as walking off the sides of the screen, you can also move up and down the screen through gaps, and explore inside buildings. When you find a part of the tent you can carry it to the beach before looking for another part. Once the tent has been built then you can find the cast members by hitting them when found and leading them to the tent. Also walking around the streets are a policeman and crocodile and if you touch the policeman then he arrests you and takes you to the Police Station losing a part or cast member, which appear elsewhere. If you touch the crocodile then the tide advances further but dropping one of a limited amount of sausages gets rid of the crocodile. ",
