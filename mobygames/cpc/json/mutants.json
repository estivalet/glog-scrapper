  "description": "In the distant future, human beings have outposts all over the galaxies, but wars and aggression have not died out. Neither has opposition to potential exploitation or environmental damage; your resistance movement has discovered that Macro-Genetic Mutoids (<i>Mutants</i>) are being bred purely to be used as weapons. <br><br>Controlling the familiarly-named <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rainbow-warrior\">Rainbow Warrior</a> in this top-view shooter, you must fly to each of the 15 mutant-breeding zones, collecting their self-destruct pods, and taking all of these to the control room. You are armed with missiles, torpedos and a shield, and can use one of these at a time. The control zone is hazardous, and any contact is destructive, but reaching its target will recharge your three lives; thus, it can be worth doing this before you have completed all 15 zones.<br><br>The gameplay element of having short levels with a single specific target to account for resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hunters-moon\">Hunter's Moon</a>.",
