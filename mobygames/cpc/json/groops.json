  "description": "<i>Groops!</i> is a tile based puzzle game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=SameGame\">SameGame</a> concept. The game is played on a board with a large number of tiles with different colours and symbols. The aim is to remove as many tiles as possible by clicking on clusters of two or more tiles of the same kind. Tiles located above the removed tiles will then drop down and take their places. When a column becomes empty the tiles left of it will move and take its place. The game goes on until there are no more tiles that can be removed. <br><br>There are three different game modes: normal, fast and challenge. In the normal mode the whole playing field is covered by tiles while the fast mode only has half the amount. The challenge mode consists of a series of sixteen increasingly more difficult levels. To progress from one to another a minimum score has to be reached. ",
