  "description": "Codemasters applied the fast-pitching 3D isometric graphics of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marble-madness\">Marble Madness</a> to this recreation of skateboarding. There are 7 levels of gameplay, each featuring a skate park and then a cross-country section with a top-down view.<br><br>In the skate park you have to collect all the flags, without leaving the tarmac too much, and within a strict time limit. In the cross-country event you must skate between a series of flags. This time there are hazards such as trees and buildings to avoid hitting.",
