  "description": "<i>E.X.I.T</i> is a surreal point-and-click adventure game in French that takes you through time and space. The game environment displayed through a first-person perspective takes up about a third of the screen and it is shown in a rectangle in the top right part of the screen. On the left side there are three buttons that can be clicked (by moving a cursor shaped as a hand) to interact. Near the top left is the inventory.<br><br>The main goal is figuring out a way to repair the space ship after being stranded on a planet. There is no linear path to follow and right from the start there is freedom of exploration. Progressing involves locating pieces and solving puzzles. Eventually a second, very different part of the game is reached with action sequences, puzzles with 2D-scrolling elements as well as navigating a 3D environment with real-time movement. ",
