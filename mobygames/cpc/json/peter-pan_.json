Click the item that moves, which is the Indian village.<br><br>Here, you must navigate a watery maze, gathering floating items. Be careful that the Indian brave in his canoe doesn't catch you or you'll lose a life.<br><br>After that, it is off to the Lost Boys' village. You must run a maze, gathering flowers, while avoiding a pirate.<br><br>Then, it is off to the Mermaid Lagoon. You must click on each mermaid so Peter can jump rocks to get to Wendy. <br><br>After that, you move to a tree with a playhouse. You must click around to find the hiding children, like hide-and-seek.<br><br>Finally, it is off to Captain Hook's ship, the Jolly Roger, where you must run a maze, avoiding three pirates, to get to and rescue Wendy. This will send Hook packing and win the game.",
