  "description": "8 challenging zones of battle await you in your role as a tank driver. The game is viewed from above, with rotational control and forward/reverse power for the tank. The routes to travel along are narrow and varied, so some exploration is required – some paths are inevitably safer and faster than others. The walls are particularly useful as they are strong enough to deflect shots, so you can often attack from safe positions round a corner.<br><br>Opposition includes gun turrets firing at you, enemy tanks and landmines. You start with a standard gun, which must be held down longer to take out tougher foes, but can collect smart bombs and shields. A first-person viewpoint section follows each of these sections, with the sighting under your control, and more helicopters and jeeps to take on.",
