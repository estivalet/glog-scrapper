For public relations, you can choose Honesty or Hype. The program takes seasonal factors into account -- for example, you'll always sell less in summer. At the end of each month, you can review a monthly statement to check your progress. After each year, the board of directors will check your progress -- if you did badly, you may be fired.<br><br>The game has seven difficulty levels and offers the the possibility to save the game.",
