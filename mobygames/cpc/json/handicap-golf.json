  "description": "A very BASIC (as in written in BASIC language) golf game seen from above, <i>Handicap Golf</i> works by letting you enter the angle you want to hit your ball, using the digits of the clock, and the force of your strike on a scale between 0 and 250. An additional variable affecting the outcome is the wind, which is displayed when you input your numbers. Each hole covers one screen and features woods, bunkers and dams. Being written in BASIC, Handicap Golf uses slowly drawn text characters for graphics.",
