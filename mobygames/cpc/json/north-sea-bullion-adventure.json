  "description": "<i>North Sea Bullion Adventure</i> casts the player as the the captain of the salvage tug boat &quot;Narwal&quot;. You are on the hunt for a wrecked World War II vessel the HMS Bearheart. The ship went down in arctic waters and is rumored to have held valuable cargo. Take to the high seas on your mission to find and retrieve its cargo.<br><br>The game provides instructions on-screen and uses a text parser for keyboard input with a total of twenty unique commands to choose from. Find the shipwreck and retrieve the sunken cargo before running out of fuel, oxygen, or time. The game, while rather unclear, has no proper ending but instead allows the user to decide when to finish. This ambiguity may lead to confusion for players who did not read the instruction manual.",
