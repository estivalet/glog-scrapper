  "description": "Set during the collapse of the Soviet Union, this arcade style game puts the player in control of a Soviet tank. This tank must explore the areas of Vilnius and Baku and rescue all Russian citizens. Meanwhile, the rebel armies will attack with everything they have.<br><br>The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=SWIV\">SWIV</a>, but the need to rescue a certain number of hostages to complete the level adds a limited strategy element: the goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a task literally impossible as they re-spawn within seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being blown up.",
