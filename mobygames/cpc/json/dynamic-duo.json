  "description": "In <i>Dynamic Duo</i> the player takes the role of a bird and a dwarf who explore a haunted castle. The goal is to open the door to the calculation room, but to do so ten hidden keys have to be found first. <br><br>The screen is divided into three parts: the action screen, a map and the status screen. The player can switch between the two protagonists at will and if they explore different parts of the castle (or if a second player takes part)  the map gets replaced with a second action screen. This is necessary because the two have different abilities: the bird can fly and is generally faster while only the dwarf can open chests. On their way they meet various enemies that can be shot with a gun with a limited amount of ammo.",
