With a headache and no memory. <br><br>The object of the game is to completely regain your memory.  As you progress in the game a word or phrase will trigger memories of the past.  Like most adventure games the fun of the game is centered on discovery of you and your surroundings.<br><br>The player can use a 'Think' command to reflect on situations which can assist in recovering your identity.",
