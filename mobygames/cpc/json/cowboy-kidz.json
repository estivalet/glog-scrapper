  "description": "<i>Cowboy Kidz</i> is a top view vertical scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls constantly upwards as you control a cowboy on a horse shooting bandits to protect a mail-train. You ride alongside the train and you can go in front or behind it to ride along the other side. Bandits appear on the screen as you ride and they must be shot or avoided. Rocks and cactus also have to be avoided and if you touch a bandit or the other obstacles then you lose one of three lives. On later levels bandits shoot at you from the train and rivers appear which you have to cross by bridges.",
