  "description": "<i>Bomber</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Blitz\">Blitz</a>-style game. Like in other games of this type, you control an aircraft which is moving from the left to the right of the screen above a deserted city. Each time your aircraft reaches the right side of the screen it reappears of the left side at a slightly lower altitude. You need to drop bombs on the buildings below so that you can land on the ground safely, however you can only drop one bomb at a time. If you are successful the game restarts, increasing the speed of you aircraft or the height of the buildings. The game ends once you fail to clear out the buildings and end up crashing into them.",
