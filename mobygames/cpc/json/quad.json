  "description": "Mounting your Quad, you, Agent X27, have only idea in mind: to cross the border  and leave the desert with the plans you are carrying as quick as possible. Half of secret services are already chasing you and they will not be gentle! In addition, the representatives of Agency &quot;forgot&quot; to inform you that the track across the desert was not used for years. There was everything: rocks, boulders, cacti and even the carcasses of animals! With all this, you should not miss jerrycans placed by Agency to refuel your Quad. And also avoid the helicopter!<br><br>The game is a third-person racing arcade set in the desert full of different obstacles. The player controls the Quad to stay on the track, avoiding the obstacles, and collecting the jerrycans to refuel the Quad. If the fuel level reaches zero, helicopter appear and eliminate the Quad's life. Time is flowing and you should speed up your Quad. Points are earned as the player progresses through the game. The player begins with a limited number of lives; lives may be decreased with Quad's elimination, and increased with certain amount of points gained.<br><br>The game is available for 1-6 players performing their actions one-by-one to compare their results after the game finish.",
