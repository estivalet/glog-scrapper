  "description": "Mr. Stein is keen to build monsters, using the bones he has throughout his mansion. Each time he must collect the parts required, in the correct order, by navigating away around the platforms. He can only jump while on spring spaces; other landscape features include ice and slime to affect movement, and fireman's poles. Enemies moving around on preset paths include spiders, tanks and lobsters. <br><br>Once all parts are connected Frank must activate the switch on the monster's case. This takes you onto a screen in which you must reach the top right, avoiding the balls the monster throws down at you as they roll along the platforms.",
