  "description": "<i>Quaterne</i> is an adaptation of the board game Connect Four. It can be played by two human players or by one player against an AI opponent. The game board consists of fifteen columns that the players drop checkers into by typing in the corresponding number. To win the game a player needs to get four checkers in a line, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When playing against the AI, the game has a built-in advice system and will at any time show the best next three moves.",
