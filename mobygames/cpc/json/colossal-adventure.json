  "description": "<i>Colossal Adventure</i> takes its cue from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Adventure+versions\">the very earliest mainframe text adventures</a>. Our hero must rescue the elves and find fifteen pieces of treasure. There are many dark areas, so lights and batteries are at a premium. Be careful of vicious dwarves, who can be killed using axes. You can carry up to four objects at a time; the useful ones include a newspaper, keys and sandwiches. The vocabulary includes saying spell names, DROPping items to stay within the carrying limit (and for other specific reasons), CATCHing a bird, and standard directions plus IN and OUT.",
