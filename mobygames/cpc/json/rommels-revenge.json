  "description": "<i>Rommel's Revenge</i> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Battlezone\">Battlezone</a>. Like the original game it is a first person game with wireframe graphics where the player controls a tank that has to shoot down other tanks without getting hit by their fire. The game takes places on a plain with mountains in the distance and various geometric solids (such as pyramids and cubes) acting as obstacles. Movement is limited to moving forward and reverse and rotating left and right. The game goes on until the player has lost all lives. A radar helps the player finding the location of the enemies.<br><br>Some additional features exist in later versions of the game. The Dragon/CoCo version has some additional enemies such as saucers and anti-tank missiles. The Amstrad version (retitled Tank Busters) makes further changes and uses the graphics engine from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cpc/dark-star\">Dark Star</a>. The player here has two weapons, a regular cannon and anti tank missiles as well as a shield that can absorb some hits before the tank is destroyed. There is however only one life. The anti tank missiles can be steered manually by the player and it is possible to turn on a missile eye's perspective. ",
