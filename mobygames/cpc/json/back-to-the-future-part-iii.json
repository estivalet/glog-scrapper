  "description": "<i>Back to the Future III</i> is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie <i>Back to the Future III</i> and turns them into arcade sequences:<ul>\n<li><b>Buckboard Chase</b>: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.</li><br>\n<li><b>Shooting Gallery</b>: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.</li><br>\n<li><b>Pie Throwing</b>: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.</li><br>\n<li><b>The Train</b>: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</li></ul>",
