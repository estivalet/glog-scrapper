  "description": "Not to be confused with Atari Games' <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Rampart\">Rampart</a>, Ramparts is in fact a clone of Bally Midways' <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rampage\">Rampage</a>, but with a medieval theme, and players are giant knights instead of monsters. The game is for one or two players simultaneously, and each has the opportunity to enter in a five-character name before play begins, which will subsequently be displayed next to individual scores during play. <br><br>The game takes place on a single screen, where the player(s) can move left and right on one foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the individual buildings until each, and all collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring some to be taken down before others. Players will be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the like. <br><br>The back story concerns two knights, Sir Griswold and Sir Larkin, who have had a curse set upon them to be transformed into giants by the Evil One, and they must quest for the fiend, so that they may be restored to mere mortals. \n",
