  "description": "In <i>Gunboat</i>, the goal is to infiltrate the enemy's network of inland waterways and destroy all their naval bases. To do this the player takes command of a new hydrofoil. The boat is armed with an arsenal of deck cannons, homing missiles, forward-firing torpedoes and rear-launched depth charges. Obviously the enemy are not going to make it easy, and have deployed helicopters, submarines and gunboats. Next to missile-launching bases, the river banks are lined with fuel and ammo depots. When there is little or no opposition, it is possible to dock at the depots to resupply or conduct repairs.<br><br>The action is viewed from the side in a forced perspective 3-D. The mission ends when the own boat takes 100% damage or runs out of fuel, the engine overheats, or the four enemy bases are destroyed.",
