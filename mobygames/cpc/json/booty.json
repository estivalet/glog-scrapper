  "description": "Like any good pirate ship, the old vessel upon which <em>Booty</em> is set is overloading with treasure and so the player takes the role of Jim the Cabin Boy as he tries to collect as much of it as he can. The ship is viewed side-on in a platform-type perspective, and contains 20 holds, each of which is split across 8 screens of treasure. Once the player has cleared each one they have 45 seconds to escape the hold and prepare for the next one.<br><br>The levels all feature lots of doors, each of which has its own key to open it - these are numbered. As only one key can be held at a time (pick another up and the first one returns to its original location), and many of the enemies are located behind doors, a great deal of strategy as to which order the keys are collected is required.",
