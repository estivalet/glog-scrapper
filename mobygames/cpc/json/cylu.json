  "description": "If you are to be honored with the leadership of the Ostan race, you must explore a virtual reality world, collect the 24 objects which have been hidden within, and bring them all back to the base.<br><br>Cylu is viewed isometrically, and primarily consists of solving puzzles along the lines of many <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Ultimate+Play\">Ultimate Play the Game</a> titles. Only five objects can be carried at a time, which means the route involves a lot of back-tracking. This is slightly lessened once you find some of the teleport bays, and the key to operate them.<br><br>There are 32 numbered forcefields around the game, and these must be deactivated by finding the appropriate silicon chip. Your droid requires regular re-fueling, either from canisters located in the early sections of the game, or from the RFL unit you can pick up later.",
