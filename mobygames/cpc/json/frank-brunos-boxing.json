  "description": "Former boxing World Champion Frank Bruno, famed for his catchphrase &quot;you know what I mean, Harry?&quot; and more recently his heroic battle with depression, put his name  to this boxing game which replicates <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/super-punch-out_\">Super Punch-Out!!</a>. As Frank, you must take on 8 progressively tough boxers (3 on C16) to win the title.  <br><br>The action is viewed from right behind Frank in 3D, meaning that you can see and feel the full impact of punches. A full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.<br><br>Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down.<br><br>Most of your opponents have a special move which must be avoided, or you will be floored instantly.<br><br>Once you have beaten all of your opponents you are declared Champion of the World.",
