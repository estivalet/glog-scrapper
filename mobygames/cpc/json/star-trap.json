  "description": "Year is 2189, humanity has visited numerous galaxies due to the hyper-space engines. In search of adventure and exotics of the distant lands you have signed contract for 5 years with the Intergalactic Company to work on the Space Lines. For your first trip you were appointed as technician trainee on the freighter AMPELOS. The freighter left Achernar VI in direction of Tau Ceti II. Some hours later you were in the room of piloting when suddenly all alarms start... What is that? You have only 8 hours to discover it.<br><br>You start to explore the freighter AMPELOS. Robots became uncontrollable and attack you. They are surely behind the commander's death. Happily, the computer can help you to deactivate them. But your adventure is only beginning and already the cap of the dead commander (peace to his soul) reveal a number, which you remembers quickly.<br><br>The gameplay flows as the icon-based first-person adventure. You may move in available directions and do the actions via set of  icons, which are &quot;Take&quot;, &quot;Put&quot;, &quot;Look at&quot;, &quot;Examine&quot;, &quot;Use&quot;, and some new such as &quot;Listen&quot;, &quot;Recharge&quot; (a battery, a weapon). Another icon allows you to start a dialogue, for example, with the navigator or the doctor. You can then ask them simple questions from predefined words such as &quot;HOW TO DEACTIVATE ROBOTS?&quot; and you'll hear the words pronounced. At the right side of the screen you'll see the objects in your possessions and useful information: health, fatigue, your ammunition, your reservation of air (if you are wearing a combine suit). When you arrive in a place, you should use the icon to look at the place (the eye), sometimes several times to discover objects. Then (and before taking the object) you should use the magnifier on the object, because it can't be used on the object already put in inventory. <br><br>Amstrad CPC version of the game is port of Atari ST version and use only 4 colours.",
