  "description": "This water skiing game was known at the time for its realistic simulation.  There are only three events, but fortunately they are pleasant to play. They are slalom, free figures and, to finish, jump with ski. If at the beginning it is tricky to find a good technique, once you find it the game becomes much more tedious. The Gods Of The Sea also featured the sponsorship of a celebrity at that time: Patrice Martin.",
