  "description": "This <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>-inspired arcade adventure has three separate challenges, each of which can be loaded from the main screen. All are viewed from above, and involve shooting enemies (contact with whom drains your energy). Your health is represented by gradually-withering pineapples, which are recharged by eating food.<br><br>The first is set in Egypt - you are locked inside a treasure-packed temple, and must escape through seven locked doors, each of which has its own key. The second sees you on a doomed spaceship, needing to collect security passes and circuit board pieces. The third is in a city full of mutants - escape passages are locked and a crucial document is in 24 pieces.<br><br>The minimum target of escaping involves collecting keys - note that each barrier has only one way of being opened. To be a true hero, you must collect the sets of 24 treasure pieces/circuit board pieces/torn document pieces within the levels.",
