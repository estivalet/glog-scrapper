The player controls a duck called Red Jack who is also a pirate that now has been trapped in the dungeons of a palace. The duck moves over a grid which is meant to represent flagstones which disappear after being walked on and has to reach terraductile eggs before they hatch. If one hatch a bird will appear and kill the duck. In addition to moving around the grid it also possible to move a full row of flagstones and all objects on it left and right. There are sixteen dungeon levels with different monsters that have to be avoided. It is also important to not run into any of the cooking pots that are located around the grid.
