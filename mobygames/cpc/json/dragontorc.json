Morog seeks to recover the five crowns of Dragontorc in order to remake the Torc of power. Maroc has to find the remaining crowns and defeat Morag to save the realm.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to the predecessor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/avalon___\">Avalon</a>, where the player controls Maroc's astral projection and the projection can only act or move through the use of spells. A new feature is that other characters can now be recruited to your cause.\nEnemies will attack the projection and drain its energy which can be replenished with a spell, if depleted the projection is destroyed and the game reverts to Maroc's physical body, ready for another go.",
