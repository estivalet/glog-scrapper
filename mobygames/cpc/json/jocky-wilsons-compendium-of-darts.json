  "description": "Zeppelin's second game licensed from the successful darts player has a much wider scope than the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jocky+Wilson+Challenge\">Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge</a>. The control system involves directing a hand which guides the dart, but this is constantly moving in a random arc, reflecting realistic jitters but making accurate aiming difficult at first. The standard 501 darts rules are among the six games included.<br><br>The other games include variants loosely based on football (hit the bulls-eye to start scoring, then a double adds one goal to your score) and bowls (in which a 'jack' dart is thrown by one player, and the aim is to get your darts as close to it as possible). There are also Ten-Dart century (score exactly 100 with 10 darts), Shanghai (where only darts thrown at a particular area can score) and Scram (where one player shoots to successively knock sectors out of play, and the opponent must score as much as possible from the others).",
