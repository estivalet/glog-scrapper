  "description": "<i>Buggy II</i> is an off-road racing arcade game, where the player is driving across the desert full of different obstacles controlling his buggy. Before the buggy runs out of fuel, it needs to find a finish line using the turn signals. The obstacles include the canisters and holes with bridges. Collision with a canister means the car's explosion, and it is possible to use the bumps to jump over them. But the jumps decrease the car's fuel reserves, which may be refueled passing through white poles, and it affects the bonus at the finish. Highest scores are stored in the Top 7 table.",
