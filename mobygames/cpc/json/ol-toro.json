  "description": "<i>Olé, Toro</i> is an early game (though not the first) dedicated to the Spanish tradition of bullfighting. Here you will play the role of the bullfighter, who is situated in the middle of the screen. He will have to avoid the repeated attacks the brave animal will try to commit against him by appearing on the right. For that, you should develop an accurate technique and learn the exact moment you need to press the keys in order to activate every move. Otherwise, you will most probably pass the next days in the Plaza's hospital.",
