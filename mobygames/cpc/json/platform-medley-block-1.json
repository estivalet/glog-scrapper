  "description": "<i>Platform Medley Block #1</i> is a 2D game starring Mari Stormbringer. She works as a cashier in the L.E.S.S. supermarket which is about to go bankrupt because there are hardly any customers. Mari is terribly bored at work and due to a series of events involving n&amp;n's candy and alkaline batteries her brain gets affected by radioactivity and she ends up in an alternate 2D dimension with brick-like pixels. The player has to help bring her back to the real world.<br><br>The game has a bright and colour world. It consists of several single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic with an amount of freedom to explore. Mari has fifteen lives and she needs to complete platforming sections, dodge a wide variety of enemies and avoid hazards such as spikes. When she comes in contact with an enemy or a hazard a life is lost. She has no means to attack.",
