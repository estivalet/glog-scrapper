  "description": "The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Rambo\">Rambo</a> doppelganger, which the developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style.<br><br>Gameplay follows the usual pattern for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ikari-warriors\">Ikari Warriors</a>-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of. ",
