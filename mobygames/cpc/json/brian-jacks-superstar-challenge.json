  "description": "This is a multi-event sports game licensed by British judoka and 1972 Olympic bronze medallist <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,489640/\">Brian Jacks</a> and loosely based on the BBC sports programme Superstars.  In this game you compete against Brian in eight different events and you score points in these events based on your performance.  The events are Running, Archery, Cycling, Football, Swimming, Squat Thrusts, Canoeing and Arm Dips.  There is no qualification time/score to beat and you compete in all events regardless of performance.  The game plays in a number of levels and should you score more points than Brian you win the level and move onto the next one where the process is repeated.  Afterwards the scores from each level are combined for a total score, should Brian score more points than you at the end of any level then you will lose the challenge.<br><br>The Amstrad and ZX Spectrum versions are split into two sides of four events each.  The Running, Archery, Cycling and Football events are in side A and after you've competed in those events you are given a choice of starting again or loading side B, which contains Swimming, Squat Thrusts, Canoeing and Arm Dips.  The Commodore 64 version allows a two-player option to play against a friend.\n",
