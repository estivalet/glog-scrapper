  "description": "Tough Vietnam veteran John Rambo is called back into action after some soldiers are taken hostage in a PoW camp. His orders are to simply capture photographic evidence of the war crimes taking place, but after finding a close friend tied up, he decides to wipe them all out by himself. This being Hollywood, chances are that he will succeed.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Ocean\">Ocean</a>'s interpretation of his challenge recreates <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Commando\">Commando</a> fairly closely. You move up the screen, taking out enemies – these respawn, so there is no value in not moving upwards as quickly as possible. Find strategic positions from which to attack. Touch each hostage you find to free them.<br><br>You have knives and grenades, but using the latter alerts the enemy as to your presence, making life harder. Extra weapons such as rocket launchers and machine guns can be collected en route.",
