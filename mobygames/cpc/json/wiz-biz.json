  "description": "<i>Wiz Biz</i> is a single player text adventure with graphics. <br><br>While this adventure game does not actually start in a tavern the storyline has its roots there. The player takes the role of Ralph. Ralph is a bit of a wizard, a wizard who likes a drink or two. During a particularly good night Ralph had some drinks and then, for fun, turned some chap into a pink salamander. <br>\nThe spell wore off of course but Mike, the chap in question, was not especially pleased. It's now the morning after that fateful night and the player awakes in one of the dungeon's of Mike's castle. The aim of the game is to escape the dungeon.",
