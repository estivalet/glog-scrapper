  "description": "2160.  Beam technology, energy shields, and ground-skimming propulsion systems have revolutionized ground combat into high-speed, wide-ranging battles. World powers like the Pacific Combine and the European League spar and vie for territory with Grav tanks, striders, and Leviathans.  Take the role of a commander overseeing one of these skirmishes and match your tactical wits with the computer or another player.<br><br>Firezone translates pen-and-paper, tactical wargaming to the computer screen.  Your primary view is a hex battle map with up to seven different types of terrain, showing stacks of infantry, artillery, armor, and command bases.    There is a structured turn sequence, with players alternating movement, fire, and retaliation.  The game stretches beyond a table-top wargame by allowing hidden units and providing a map-editor with which to create your own scenarios (nine are included).",
