  "description": "In this early Superman game, the player takes control of Superman, battling against the supervillain Darkseid. Optionally another player can take the role of Darkseid, competing with Superman for the fate of the citizens of Metropolis. The game play consists of different action-oriented sections including top down city blocks, 3D flying, overhead vertical and side scrolling.<br><br>The objective for Superman is to save the inhabitants from the lure of Darkseid, who wants to corrupt them and take them to his underground lair. Primary sections of the game take part in the streets and sewers of Metropolis, where the opponents can use adjustable deflectors to guide the humans in the directions of their choice, as well as use their superpowers to manipulate the humans.The city is divided into several sectors and once a character collects a set numbers of diamonds the sector can be completed. In between sectors there is a combat zone which takes the form of various arcade-like mini games. If the character who decided to move between sectors wins the combat, play progresses to the next sector. Otherwise play returns to the previous sector.<br><br>Superman uses his heat vision and Darkseid the omega ray to battle, each hit will take energy away from the opponent. When one of the character's energy is depleted, the number of saved or corrupted citizens is tallied and the winner is the one who has the most.",
