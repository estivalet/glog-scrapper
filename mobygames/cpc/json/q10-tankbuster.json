  "description": "You are a pilot of a <i>Q10 Tankbuster</i> and you have been sent to various war zones to destroy enemy aircraft, vehicles and other objects important to their cause. You are armed with a front firing gun as well as the ability to drop bombs. As you destroy the enemy, occasionally a blue helicopter will fly towards you and when shot it will leave behind a icon which increases your firepower, gives a shield, or an extra life. Getting hit by bullets or an enemies vehicle or aircraft loses a life. When all lives are lost then it is game over. At the end of each level is a huge end of level vehicle which needs destroying to progress to the next level.<br><br><i>Q10 Tankbuster</i> is a side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls from left to right constantly and you use a joystick or keyboard to control your plane.",
