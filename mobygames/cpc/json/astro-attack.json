  "description": "Your space fighter has been teleported into the grid: an arena where the alien Rigonites destroy captured vessels for their amusement. Fortunately you are not defenceless, and possess a photon blaster capable of obliterating their vessels. But you must destroy each wave of enemies before their &quot;Matter Zapper&quot; weapon has become fully charged, or you are doomed.<br><br>Astro Attack is a top-down space shoot-em-up on a grid, similar to the earlier arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/targ\"> Targ </a>. There are a total of 40 levels of increasing difficulty, with each wave of enemies being more deadly and numerous. The starting wave has 4 passive enemies, and walls of energy that suddenly appear and annihilate your ship on contact. Later enemies also shoot back.<br><br>Bonus points are given for the time remaining at the end of the level, as well as collecting tumbling satellites that appear throughout the game.\n",
