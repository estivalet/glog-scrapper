  "description": "This action shoot ‘em up has an unusual setting, pitching you as a movie stuntman trying to complete the toughest scenes of the latest blockbuster. <br><br>The scenes include desert chases, forest rallying and Grand Canyon jumps. There are 7 levels in total, each teeming with ‘bad guys’ and scenery obstacles. You score points for each enemy you shoot down. <br><br>Unusually, you get bonuses for crashing anything up to twice (as this can be perceived to maximize the action stakes for the film), but a third crash means Game Over.\n",
