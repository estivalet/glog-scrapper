  "description": "Here's your chance to join Sergeant Seymour in his latest blockbuster <i>Robot Cop</i>. The game stars Seymour in a grim city in the future. Here he must clear 30 levels of many villains and a boss each. Every level is a maze viewed from above. Once all villains in a stage have been arrested the boss is automatically destroyed.<br><br>Weapons available to Seymour are his bionic stretching arm or his 'cuff gun. Keeping the fire button held down makes the arm extend more and the cuffs more potent. As each villain is arrested they release bonuses for extra points. Other bonuses to collect and use are a telephone to call the SWAT team, a blue light that protects Seymour for one hit and a rainbow tile that gives extra speed. Collect the letters ROBOTCOP and this moves Seymour onto a bonus stage. Be wary though of apples and cans thrown at you and steer clear of any bombs.",
