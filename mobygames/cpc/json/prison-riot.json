  "description": "Seven prisoners have incited a minor riot, and you are the one who must prevent it from becoming a major riot. You have 15 minutes to find them and then bring them down from the roof, but to arrest them you must complete a short word-unscrambling puzzle sequence to diffuse their booby-traps.<br><br>The bulk of the game is a flick-screen fighting game, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Joe+Blade\">Joe Blade series</a>. Prisoners can be attacked with your rifle, or by kicking them in the head. Any other contact drains energy, and you have only one life. Keys are required to open security doors; these plus extra bullets and energy can be collected as you go.",
