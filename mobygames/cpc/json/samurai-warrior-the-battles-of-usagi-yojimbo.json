  "description": "With the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bugs-bunny-crazy-castle_\">Roger Rabbit</a> film (and game) successful, and the Jive Bunny phenomenon shaking up charts worldwide, perhaps it was time to redress the balance away from wimpy rabbits. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Stan+Sakai\">Stan Sakai</a>'s comic character set in the 17th century did this, being capable of a range of martial arts moves. In this licensed game he'll need them to save Japan from being taken over by evil.<br><br>The game is side-scrolling and has large beat 'em up elements, but also incorporates Karma. Negative actions such as needless violence will be punished with a loss of Karma, while positives ones (such as bribing those who give Karma) are rewarded. When in combat, energy gauges display the condition of both yourself and your rival. Money collected can be spent on food for energy boosts.",
