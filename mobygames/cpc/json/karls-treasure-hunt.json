  "description": "Karl has won first prize in a quiz, which is a weekend stay at Wonga mansion. On arrival, he finds himself in a maze of 40 surreal rooms containing platforms, miscellaneous hazards and a collectable key in each room. <br><br><i>Karl's Treasure Hunt</i> is a platform game and a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/karls-kavern\">Karls Kavern </a> for the BBC Micro. It is clearly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Set+Willy\">Jet Set Willy </a> in its gameplay and the same sort of oddly named rooms with unusual and obscure occupants moving in strangely regimented patterns. Karl may be moved left or right, or may jump. Contact with many objects in the room or falling from a modest height will result in the loss of one of an initial five lives. To escape and win a treasure, Karl must visit each and room and pick up the key before eventually making his way to the exit.",
