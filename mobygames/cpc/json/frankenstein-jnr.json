  "description": "Players take control of the son of Frankenstein's monster, and are tasked with the objective to rebuild his dad. Franky Jr. needs to search the castle for his father's body parts so that they can be rejoined back together. This will allow Franky Jr. to reanimate his father's body by jolting it back to life with 10,000 volts of electricity. Franky Jr. can also collect keys to open certain doors. Ghosts and skeletons will try to stop him by draining his energy which will eventually lead to a cardiac arrest if his energy gets too low.<br><br>The game is a flick-screen maze game. One room is seen at a time. The joystick moves Franky Jr. while the fire button allows him to pick up objects. The screen also shows his energy, his heartbeat, and any objects he has picked up.",
