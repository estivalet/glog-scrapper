  "description": "<i>Yabba Dabba Doo</i> was the first video game released based on The Flintstones television series. <br><br>In <i>Yabba Dabba Doo</i> the player has to help Fred win Wilma's heart. To do this he must build a house by collecting rocks and putting them in the right place. There are obstacles to this, small rocks get in the way, turtles bite your ankles and pterodactyls drop rocks on you too. Also while you're away neighbours will pinch bits.\nOnce the house is built, you have to get Fred a car so that he can get to the quarry to work, thus earning enough money to hire a dino crane to put the roof on. Progress is measured by points, these are gained as you build the house, get to work and finally find Wilma.",
