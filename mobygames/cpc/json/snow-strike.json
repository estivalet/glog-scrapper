You've land missions like free flight, destroy drug labs, bomb drug refineries, destroy drug stores and destroy drug convoy. You've aircraft carrier missions like free flight, destroy enemy aircraft carriers, destroy drug ships and destroy enemy oil supplies. \nIn the air you can fight the MiG-27, Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 armed with heat or radar guided missiles!<br><br>You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. \nYou can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous).\nThe weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed.\nYou'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. \nYou can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!",
