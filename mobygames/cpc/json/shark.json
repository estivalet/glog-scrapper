Your craft is armed with a small phased plasma armour piercing laser weapon. Upgrade your craft with objects you can collect dropped from exploding enemy crafts. Collect mines, missiles, bouncing bombs, wire-guided missiles, shields, extra energy, plasma blasters, or a high power generator to speedup your craft. Avoid contact with enemy craft which drain your energy. A panel displayed at the top of the screen will give you essential information like energy level, weapon system in use, Score, Lives left, Remaining ammunition of Weapon. ",
