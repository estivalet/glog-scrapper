  "description": "You are Steve Jordan, pilot of the spacejet Eagle. Cyborgs conquered the universe, but this event did not make you happy. And you decided to restore the freedom of the lifeforms discovering and destroying the mother planet of the Cyborgs. Riding the Eagle, you cruise the entire space full of asteroids, energy cells, and enemy Cyborgs' spaceships. On each stage you have to avoid the asteroids, collect energy cells, shoot the spaceships attacking you, and contact space stations (Alcor, Torius, Casiope, etc.). Finishing the stages you interrogate with space station's inhabitants to take an additional information (true or false) to find finally the coordinates of the Cyborgs' mother planet.",
