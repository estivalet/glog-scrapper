  "description": "Sliding block puzzle games were one of the many non-electronic forms of entertainment re-made with new twists for the digital age. The basic premise involves being presented with 1 of 10 pictures (representing famous figures such as Ronald Reagan, Maggie Thatcher, Lady Diana and even Sir Clive Sinclair), with the complete picture presented at the side of the screen. You must move your cursor onto the, pick up a piece, and place it onto the main playing area, ensuring that you can move the others into place. Unlike with the plastic versions there are 16 pieces to fit into 20 spaces, allowing more leeway in terms of continual sliding. The complications in this version include gaps in the playing area which swallow pieces and return them to the bank, a time limit, bombs which have to be moved off the screen to avoid losing a life, and bonus objects to be moved in specific ways for bonus points.",
