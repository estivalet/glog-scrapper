  "description": "In most funfairs or theme parks you would find a stall which lets you participate in a horse race against other people. Customers throw a ball trying to get it into a hole. If the ball enters the hole the their horse will move. The further away the hole, the further the horse will move. The winner receives a prize.<br><br>Welcome to the computer version of this game. You first enter how many players (1 or 2), the name of your horses and choose between easy or hard. Then the actual game begins. There are nine classic races to participate in including Ascot and The Kentucky Derby. Flat and jump races are included. Left and right on the joystick moves the hand. A cursor at the top moves left and right. Holding down the fire button stops the cursor and starts the power bar, let it go and the power bar stops. Keep doing this till your horse either finishes 1st or 2nd. If you finish last then you lose a credit.<br><br>The game is displayed in a 3D view of the board at the bottom. There are two boards viewed. The playing character is represented by a floating hand. In the middle of the boards is a commentator keeping track of the race. At the top of the screen is a side view the race.",
