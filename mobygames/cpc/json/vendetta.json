  "description": "You, a former army hero, have to save your brother (a military scientist who developed the ultimate weapon) and his little daughter who are kidnapped by blood-thirsty terrorists. The same terrorists you have fought  some years ago. The cops think you are somehow involved in the kidnapping, and so your job is obvious: rescue your family members and wash your name clear by collecting evidence over various stages.<br><br>The gameplay could be compared with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Last+Ninja\">Last Ninja</a> series. It has an isometric view and is flick screen. You can pick up useful items like weapons (knives, and guns), which blink when you enter a screen containing such an item, as well as the evidence needed to complete each stage. Any collected evidence is shown on a camera film reel. <br><br>Once all the evidence is collected on a stage then the game changes to a driving game where you have to get to the next stage. The car is viewed from behind and you must avoid the other vehicles as well as helicopters dropping bombs but your car is armed with a cannon and missiles. Police cars have to be avoided or they will ask to see any evidence you have. ",
