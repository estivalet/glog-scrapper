  "description": "The evil lord of the castle is throwing heavy blocks at you. If you stand on the opposite end of the see-saw when a block falls on it, you will be hoisted up in the air. Watch out for green monsters defending the castle's wall that grab either you or the block flying up. If five blocks are on the see-saw at once, it will become immobilized. Lives are lost when you are grabbed by a green monster or when a block crushes you. The object of the game is to fly to the top of the castle and defeat the evil lord.\n",
