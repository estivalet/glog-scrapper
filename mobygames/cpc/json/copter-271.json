The player has been summoned by the army general and is given the task to fight the enemy in the latest helicopter, Copter 271. <br><br><i>Copter 271</i> is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1942arcade\">1942</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xevious\">Xevious</a> that can be played by one or two players (in co-op). The game also scrolls horizontally when the player moves towards the borders. The gameplay simple involves shooting down all the enemies that the player comes across. Enemies include different kinds of aircraft, carriers and land based turrets. Each enemy usually takes a few shots to take down. There are twelve levels in total and most of them consist of a naval setting where the player flies over ocean and islands. The default weapon is a machine gun and by picking up power ups bonus weapons are made available such as missiles and bombs. ",
