  "description": "Kairos has kidnapped children and trapped them in mirrors inside his castle. The player takes the role of Mac in his quest so save them.<br><br>The main portion of the game is spend with walking through the castle and fighting Kairo's henchmen - either with bare hands or with weapons which can be collected on the way. However, the way is not completely linear: there are different routes to take. A boss room waits at the end of each level (overall five). There are also a multitude of extras to collect which have effects like destroying all enemies on the screen or warping. Freeing enough children by punching out mirrors gives a short time of invulnerability.",
