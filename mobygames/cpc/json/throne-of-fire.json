  "description": "This was <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Consult+Computer+Systems\">Consult Computer Systems</a> first major collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,17924/\">Mike Singleton</a>. It is a slash 'em up 1 or 2 player game in which you play one of 3 princes, each out to defeat his brothers and gain control of the castle. You can see the 2 players simultaneously side by side. <br><br>You navigate to the different rooms by selecting the windows on the scrolling castle display on the bottom of the screen. These windows are colour coded to whichever prince controls that particular room. The rooms are displayed as a view from the window showing exits left, right and forward (which can move you up or down). There is a neat animation when a player dies showing blood dribbling down the screen.",
