  "description": "As with most <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Melbourne+House\">Melbourne House</a> adventures, <i>Terrormolinos</i> has a real-world setting. You play a family man taking his wife and kids on a holiday they will never forget, for all the wrong reasons. Avoid the bulls and sharks, take care to avoid heatstroke, and make sure your family doesn't run off.<br><br>Getting there and simply surviving all the hazards the brochure 'forgot' to mention is a challenge in itself, but you must also take 10 holiday snaps to prove what you got up to.  Your film only allows 12 shots to be taken, so only 2 mistakes are allowed when choosing to take a photo you consider significant.<br><br>The game is structured similarly to a real holiday. There are day trips to go on, which provide extra photo opportunities. A few Spanish phrases such as 'QUE QUIRE USTED' ('what do you want?') and 'UNA\nHABITACION' ('a room') are included; the manual details these. The parser is primarily VERB NOUN. ",
