The fights take place in a full 3D arena, with a range of hooks, jabs and cross-punches available, aimed to the head or body.<br><br>Before you start you must create your character, including his appearance and initial abilities, and choose one of five play styles. You can start off as a New Pro or a Contender - the latter option means tougher fights form the word go, but you start halfway up the rankings. A full training options is included, allowing you to work on your boxer's abilities to best prepare for the next fight.",
