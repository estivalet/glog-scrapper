  "description": "In <i>Olympiad '86</i> players take on Weightlifting, canoeing, sprinting (200m on Spectrum, 100m on Amstrad), Skeet Shooting and Discus in order, with a qualifying target. Control instructions are offered before each event. Timing is key to most events, with a rotating power circle needing to be stopped in order to get the best performance. Canoeing concentrates on steering between marker posts without hitting them<br><br>You have three lives and lose one each time you fall short of the target - you may also be taunted by a banner from a flying helicopter if you're especially bad. Complete all five and they repeat in the same order, requiring you to go faster or further than before.",
