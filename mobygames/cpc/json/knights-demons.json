  "description": "<i>Knights &amp; Demons</i> is a variant of the puzzle game <a id=\"d1518702676c4b2fb13ec90569d22bdc3\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lights+Out\">Lights Out</a>. It's played on a board full of tiles that can be either knights or demons. By clicking on a tile, all adjacent tiles change from demon to knight or vice versa. The objective of the game is to change all the tiles so that they are all of the same type. In addition to this the player can use a limited number of pikes which allow him to change only one tile at a time. Each game has to be completed within a time limit but there are no penalties for making too many moves. Above the board is a slide with a snake head pointer. After completing a board the pointer will move either left or right depending on which tiles cover the board. By reaching one of the ends, the player will finish the game as either good or evil. Before starting a game the player can choose between easy, medium and hard difficulties.",
