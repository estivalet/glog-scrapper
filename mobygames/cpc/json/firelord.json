  "description": "The land of Torot has been oppressed by the Evil Queen; fortunately you (as Sir Galaheart) are on hand to put things right. Initially you have no weaponry as you progress through the 500 screens of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Atic+Atac\">Atic Atac</a>-influenced streets and towns, but fireballs can be collected and used against the Queen's forces.<br><br>Trading is a large part of the game, a unique aspect for a game of this type at the time. While many objects are lying around, many more must be obtained by entering the homes of people, and negotiating with them to arrange a swap. You can also attempt to steal from them, but you risk being caught and sentenced to death (losing a life in the process).",
