  "description": "Life in the chip factory is tough, Ted Blewitt needs a holiday vacation in Spain.<br><br>In this pixel-perfect platform <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/jet-set-willy\">Jet Set Willy</a> lookalike, the objective is to find Ted's camera with a 36 picture exposure film. Then take it to Spain and use it to take some snapshots before developing the film at the chemist. Ted can hold up to 8 objects at a time, some objects will help, whilst others may hinder. Some characters you meet along the way will assist, while some are hostile.\nThe game starts in July 1985 and the leave from the chip factory ends on August 10th, the correct photos have to be developed by that time.<br>\nLosing a life will reduce an energy bar, once it's depleted it's game over.",
