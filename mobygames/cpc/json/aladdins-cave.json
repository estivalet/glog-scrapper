  "description": "<i>Aladdin's Cave</i> is a platform game with similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Set+Willy\">Jet Set Willy</a>. You play as Aladdin, who has been trapped in a cave by an evil wizard. Each room in the cave contains sets of magical items that are guarded by dangerous animals and deadly traps. Collecting complete sets of objects gives Aladdin the power to transmogrify himself into different animals, such as a monkey, bird, dolphin or genie, while other objects provide him with weapons. Using these tools, Aladdin's aim is to escape from the cave and cross the desert to the fortress hide-away of the wizard, and there defeat him.<br><br>On each of the screens, there are usually two to four items to collect. While you can leave the screen at any time, unless you have collected them all, the items will reset and you will have to collect them again. The items will also reset if you lose a life, either by touching one of the on-screen hazards or by falling a sufficient distance. The game ends when you have either killed the wizard and returned to the magic cave, or you have run out of your initial five lives.",
