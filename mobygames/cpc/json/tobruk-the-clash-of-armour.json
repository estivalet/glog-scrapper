  "description": "The battle for Tobruk in May-July 1942 was one of the key battles of the North African front in World War 2. Rommel lead the Axis forces to a victory, taking out Allied forces which were gathered to densely mine a strategic defensive area of Libya. In this tactical wargame, players can do the same. Taking the six Allied supply points is crucial to your mission's success.<br><br>You must guide the movement and attacks of your units. You can also call in aircraft and engineer support. The game is turn-based; once you have given your orders, the Allies do the same. Unit damage is progressively calculated. Unlike the Allies, you use mobile suppliers, which you also command. They should be kept in range of your units (with no Allied forces in between).<br><br>The game includes optional action sequences, which can be practised outside the main game. You control navigation, driving and gunning (with turrets and machine guns) for individual units, from a first-person view.<br><br>The Amstrad version has an additional mode - by linking 2 CPCs via a special lead, a simultaneous two-player strategy-only game is set up, in which one player represents the Allies.",
