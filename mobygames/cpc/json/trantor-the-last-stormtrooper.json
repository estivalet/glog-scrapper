  "description": "In this game you play the role of a man who has been stranded on an alien planet after his space ship\nexplodes and you must find pieces of it to rebuild it. The gameplay involves you jumping across platforms and shooting at droids and aliens but also ducking to avoid high flying robots. The game is played from a side scrolling perspective. The baddies come thick and fast and the only way to cope is to keep moving.",
