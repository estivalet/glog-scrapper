  "description": "<i>Tubaruba</i> is the name of the school's problem child. He has been able to avoid big trouble so far, but now the headmaster has caught him breaking a window and amends must be made.<br>\nTo make up for his misgivings <i>Tubaruba</i> has to find fifty quid to pay for the window and the headmaster is so confident he will not be able to, he has bet his red Ferrari that the money will not be collected in time. In addition the amount collected will aslo reflect on the final grade, on the scale from A to F. <i>Tubaruba</i> passes through a series of rooms, coins and banknotes are scattered around the surroundings to be picked up, but they are jealously guarded by a host of assorted critters that zap your energy, but the protagonist can retaliate by shooting back and earning a penny for each enemy dealt with. Energy can be replenished in various ways, such as by picking up cans of soda pops or taking a ride in an electric Sinclair C5 car.",
