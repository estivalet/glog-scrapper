  "description": "<i>Pulsoids</i> is a side-view single-screen game inspired by the arcade games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a> where you control a Energy Mirror at the bottom of the screen bouncing a Laserpulse over various levels. The aim for all planets in the Galaxy including Earth is to evolve from Grade One to as high as possible. As the planets evolved it is found that activities that were essential for hunting and survival like throwing spears have now become recreations like darts and archery. As the years progressed, and activities became more competitive, a lot of planets have become Grade Thirty and the ultimate competitive game over the galaxy is called Pulsoid.<br><br>Pulsoid is a game for one or two players and the aim is to remove all the Mirrorblocks above the Energy Mirror on each screen with the Energy Mirror and Laserpulse to move to the next level. As the Laserpulse bounces around the screen,  it removes the blocks when hit but some blocks need multiple hits to remove it. Some blocks when hit release a Bonus Battery with a letter on it and when collected by the Energy Mirror gives the player a power-up like increase length, multiple pulses and activates a Plasma Barrier. If a pulse goes past the Energy Mirror to the bottom of the screen then the player loses one of three lives and if playing a two player game, the other player then plays.",
