  "description": "A shoot ‘em up set on a patchwork-quilt coloured road, Eliminator puts you in control of a ship with a basic weapon, flying along at breakneck speed. There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid - their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you’ve currently got.",
