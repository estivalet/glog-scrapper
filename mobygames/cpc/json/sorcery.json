  "description": "You are one of the last four remaining great sorcerers. When Necromancer kidnaps the other three, it is your task to rescue them within a time limit in this action adventure hybrid. <br><br>The player must fly through 17 screens including wastelands, a river and the woods, collecting items and keys to access other screens. Avoid evil ghosts and sorcerers, as they will drain your limited (but replenishable) energy. The final destination is Stonehenge, where the player must kill Necromancer using one of the three potential objects discovered during your journey.",
