  "description": "The Amstrad version of <i>D-Day</i> takes the same approach as Futura's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/d-day__\">other versions of D-Day</a>\nby being a multi-genre game comprising of four different missions. While the idea of the missions are similar how they are done is different.<br><br>1. The plane missions have been replaced with missions from the Naval simulation game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cpc/advanced-destroyer-simulator\">Advanced Destroyer Simulator</a>. <br><br>2. Paratrooper  - players select paratroopers one at a time and issue them orders as they contend with the wind. Orders include inclined flight to the left or right and accelerated or normal descent.<br><br>3. Infantry  - In this part of the game, players take on the command of an allied infantry unit as they complete 20 missions in order to gain a strong position in enemy territory. The allied unit the player issues orders to consists of anywhere between 3 to 10 soldiers that are based on a French infantry units. The soldiers can use rifles, grenades, and can also use mortar fire to attack enemy fortifications, but they have to keep a careful eye on not wasting ammo as it can run out.<br><br>4. Tank - The missions are from  <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cpc/sherman-m4\">Sherman M4</a>.",
