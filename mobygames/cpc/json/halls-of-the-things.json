  "description": "Using the gaming engine and graphical style that would be seen again in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/warlock-of-firetop-mountain\">The Warlock Of Firetop Mountain</a>, <i>Halls Of The Things</i> places our adventurous hero in a randomly generated tower. A long hallway with seven doorways in it at the start offers the player the opportunity to enter dungeon areas of varying difficulty (easiest and more open at the top, hardest at the bottom). In these areas of the tower, the player can explore, finding treasure and elixir bottles (which can be used to replenish the player's magic). Of course, things aren't that simple. The Things roam the various corridors and will chase and attack the player on sight, even going so far as to disguise themselves as ordinary objects until the player comes in range. Fortunately, the player has sword and bow, as well as magical spells, to defend and heal himself. Will this be enough for you to raise a fortune in loot or will The Things see you to your doom?",
