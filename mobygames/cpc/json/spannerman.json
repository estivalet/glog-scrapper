  "description": "There has been an earthquake at the local nuclear reactor, and the coolant lines have sprung leaks. Only one man can fix the leaks and prevent disaster. A man with a spanner... Spannerman!<br><br><i>Spannerman</i> is a single screen arcade platform game, where you must dash around the screen repairing leaks in coolant pipes. These pipes do not stay fixed, and may need to be revisited if they are not tightened sufficiently. While conducting your handy-man activities, you must avoid hazards including falling debris knocked loose by the earthquake, and rising water levels. On the above water decks, there may also be mutant anti-matter mice which can be kicked away if you get your timing right. A failed kick will give the rats an opportunity to deliver a fatal bite. <br><br>Under water decks may be visited for a short period of time, but you only have just over a minute's worth of oxygen which can be replenished above the water. Once the water has reached the top of the screen, there is no way to avoid death. Each time spannerman dies, the level starts again from the beginning.",
