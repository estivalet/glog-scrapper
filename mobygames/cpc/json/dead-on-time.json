  "description": "<i>Dead on Time</i> is an &quot;if it moves, shoot it&quot; game. Enemy ships will come from any direction, often in formations of up to four. You must shoot as many as you can but they don't shoot back, although they will ram. There are two game options:<ul><li>In Arcade, you shoot as many enemies as you can before time runs out. When you kill all the enemies in a formation, they leave capsules. Collect these to grant extra time. Collect three of the same color to get the bullet field. This allows you to absorb enemy impact, for a time.</li><li>In Score Challenge, there is no time limit but too many impacts will end the game. Score as many points as you can. You can still collect capsules to get the bullet field.</li></ul>",
