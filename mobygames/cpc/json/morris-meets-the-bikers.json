  "description": "Morris needs to get out of the car park and the player has to guide him out while avoiding kamikaze bikers. Morris can use elevators on each side of the screen to move between the floors of the car park level.Ten golden coins have to be collected to pay for they way out through the ground floor exit and to the next level of the car park. There are nine levels altogether. The player starts with four lives and lives are lost when Morris is hit by a biker. The only defence against the bikers apart from avoiding them is using Morris' horn to decimate them, but Morris is safe while inside one of the elevators. A counter counts from zero to nine while Morris is immobile and a life is lost if it goes above nine. Driving over spikes will slow Morris to a crawl and the clamps will stop him dead in his tracks. Driving over a parking ticket will result in the loss of a precious coin. \nMorris has a set amount of fuel  that is spent while driving, if Morris is out of fuel a life is lost. Fuel can be replenished by picking cans of petrol.\nTrying to exit a level before all the required coins have been picked up will also result in a loss of life.",
