  "description": "Most football management games written for 64K/48K computers concentrated their memory space on providing as many features as possible for a lone player. As the title implies, this game is an exception - 2 players each take control of a club, taking it in turns to make their managerial decisions and play their matches. For an extra competitive edge, they can include their own name among the players (which are otherwise made up of the real players of the day).<br><br>The game uses a fictional 20-team superleague, with English and Scottish clubs, as well as a knock-out cup. You can buy or sell players, who have ability ratings out of 15, and swap your squad of 19 around to choose 11 starters plus 2 substitutes. Match scores are listed along with goalscorers, although the scorers update more quickly than the scores. You are kept up to date with financial changes after each match.",
