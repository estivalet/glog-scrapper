Options include three skill levels, variable match lengths and a choice of sound or music (or both on some versions).<br><br>The match is viewed from the side, although it switches to a 3D view when the ball is close to the goal. The ball roughly sticks to the player's foot. Set pieces are controlled by moving an aiming cross-hair.",
