Very soon, however, the hero notices that something strange has been happening to the master. He frequently talks to himself and seems to be under some sort of a malevolent influence - until one day, he is mysteriously kidnapped. Looks like the brave Enchanter must venture on a perilous journey once again, and bring back the leader of the Circle.<br><br><i>Sorcerer</i> is a sequel to <i>Enchanter</i>, and is part of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Zork\">Zork universe</a>. Like its predecessors, it is a text adventure, in which the player interacts with the game world by typing combinations of verbs and objects. The spell system from the previous game is back; a new feature is the protagonist's ability to drink magical potions, which must be done sometimes in order to solve the game's puzzles.",
