  "description": "<i>Jet Bike Simulator</i> allows one or two players to race a jet ski against computer riders over a number of laps on various courses. There are three areas to race in: docks, lakes and coastline. There are a number of courses in each area and you have to complete a number of laps within a time limit to move onto the next course. There are numbered buoys on the courses that you have to ride between: if you miss a set then you don't complete a lap. The game is viewed from above and the whole course is shown on the screen. There are two difficulty levels, which set different time limits.",
