  "description": "<i>Burnin' Rubber</i>, a GX4000/CPC plus launch/bundle title (and one of the few exclusives for the range), is an arcade-style racing game, much inspired by the developers' earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Amstrad+CPC\">WEC Le Mans</a>. <br><br>The game depicts a Le Mans-inspired endurance race over four laps consisting of four checkpoints each. The game begins with a qualification lap before the race itself starts. Racing is arcade-style, with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/outrun\">Outrun</a>-style 3rd person perspective view graphics and a timer that indicates how much time is left before the next checkpoint has to be reached. Opponents fill the track and billboards fill its sidelines - crashing too fast into either displays a spectacular crash animation and takes valuable time off the clock. The game offers a choice of automatic or manual gear switching. The time of day passes during racing, thus offering driving in sunsets and sunrises and during the night.",
