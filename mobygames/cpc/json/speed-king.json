  "description": "<i>Speed King</i> is a motorbike racing game that allows you to race or practise on one of ten famous tracks like Silverstone, Monza and Daytona. Before you race you can choose the amount of laps (two, four or six) and your skill level (Novice, Champion or Pro). The race has a 3rd person perspective as you watch from behind your rider and try to beat 19 other riders. The joystick is used to control your bike. Besides controlling your speed you also have six gears which need to be changed manually. Once you have finished a race the lap-times are saved and it's time to choose another track.<br><br>The C16 version is restricted to four tracks, a set five laps, no skill level and you don't control the speed, just adjust the gears.",
