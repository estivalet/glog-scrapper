  "description": "<i>World Cup Challenge</i> is a football managerial game where you have the chance to manage either England, Scotland or Ireland in Italia 90. After selecting your team you can decide your skill level from easy, medium or hard, before the basic main menu appears. As well as looking at fixtures, tables and stats, you are also presented with a squad of players where you can pick your team and place them in various positions. When happy with your choice of team you watch match highlights which is shown from the side at an elevated angle, and you see either the left or right third of the pitch. At half-time you can replace players and change their positions. When the match is finished you can see other results before having the choice of practising your ball skills.",
