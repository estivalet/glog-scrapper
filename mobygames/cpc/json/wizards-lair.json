  "description": "Building on the basic gameplay and visual ideas of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Ultimate\">Ultimate's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/atic-atac\">Atic Atac</a>, <i>Wizard's Lair</i> stars an explorer named Pothole Pete, who is stuck in the Lair unless he can find all four pieces of the Golden Lion. The game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than the fuller jungle graphics.<br><br>The pace of the game is quite fast, and the challenge of the action elements is increased by not having infinite weaponry. The route through the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and secret rooms commonplace. Although the screens always contain a particular area, rather than the sections of different areas viewed in <i>Atic Atac</i> (meaning that the player would often have to work out how to reach some sections via other screens), a river is a central aspect of the layout, delimiting some sections of the screens.",
