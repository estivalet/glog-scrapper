  "description": "<i>Defend or Die</i> is a clone of the Williams arcade classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/defender\">Defender</a>.<br><br>The player's spacefighter is flying over the jagged planetary landscape on a mission to protect the humanoids from evil alien landers. The player patrols the two-way scrolling landscape in his ship, disposing of six different types of aliens preventing them from abducting the humans. If the aliens manage to get a human to outer space (top of the screen), it mutates and takes after you. You can rescue the humanoid by shooting the alien capturing it, but if it falls too far it will meet its end. In that case you need to swoop in to pick it up and return it safely to the surface. At the end of level, each surviving human gives you a bonus score.<br>\nYour ship is equipped with lasers and a limited number of smart bombs and the the top of the screen is dedicated to a long range scanner that shows the location of all enemies and humanoids on the level.<br><br>You start out with three lives. Each time you get hit by an enemy or an projectile you lose a live, once all lives are spent the game is over.",
