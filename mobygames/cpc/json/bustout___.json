  "description": "<i>Bustout!</i> is a breakout clone for the Amstrad CPC. As with Breakout, your task is to destroy blocks at the top of the screen by using you bat at the bottom to hit them with a ball. Each of the coloured blocks have a different score value, white blocks are worth 5 points, yellow blocks are worth 10 points, and red blocks are worth 20 points. You are giving five lives at the beginning of the game, once you've used all those lives up the game ends.",
