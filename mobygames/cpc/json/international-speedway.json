  "description": "It's time to put on leathers, helmet and goggles. It's time to become the world champion in the fast paced, 'go in an oval' sport of motorcycle speedway. After entering name, country and continent, the player starts in the local championship league. Win the league and it's on to the next higher league against harder riders. The ultimate goal is to work one's way up the leagues to become world champion.<br><br>The game is viewed behind one's rider as he navigates the oval track. Also on the screen is a bird's eye view of the track displaying the positions of all the riders. Also visible: lap time, number of laps, speedometer and a picture of the rider's hand and helmet. Controls are simple: the fire button accelerates, left and right steers. There is no brake, but once per race a special boost can be activated by pushing the joystick forward.",
