In one-player mode there are 10 opponents to take on in sequence.<br><br>The moves on offer include almost everything you'd find in real wrestling (and I don't mean WWE) - piledrivers, arm twists, body slams and turnbuckle flies, all of which are fully animated. The whole experience includes detailed multi-colour graphics and a full rock soundtrack.",
