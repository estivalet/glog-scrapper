  "description": "You are alone in Castle Frankenstein...well, you're the only person here, anyway. Scattered about the castle and its grounds are lungs, hearts, kidneys, and brains your beau Franky needs. You must use the joystick to move around the castle and find the parts that are needed. You must also locate keys to unlock doors. But beware, for while you may be the only person here, there are other dwellers within, such ghosts and skeletons. If they touch you too much, you will have a heart attack and die.",
