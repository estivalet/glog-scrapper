  "description": "<i>Run For Gold</i> is a single player athletics game in which the player trains two athletes for middle distance running, one for the 400m discipline and another for the 800m &amp; 1500m disciplines.<br><br>The player must guide their runners to success in a series of local races before being allowed to race in four major championship finals, Crystal Palace, the European championship, the world championship and finally the Olympics. The game has forty runners who use individual, realistic race tactics against whom the player must compete. The player can save the runners they train and load them back into the game the next time they play.<br><br>There are two levels of game play and a demonstration mode. <br>Playing at level 1 all the player has to do is control their runners pace, the game will automatically keep the runner in their racing lane.<br> Playing at level 2 the player must both manage the runners pace and steer them throughout the race.<br><br>This is not a button mashing game where keys have to be pressed in rapid sequence to make the runners move. The runners will run once the FIRE key has been pressed. The player has to manage the runners energy level by controlling the pace at which they run. Run too fast and they'll have no energy left for a sprint finish at the end of the race, run to slow and they will be too far behind to catch up.\n",
