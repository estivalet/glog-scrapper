  "description": "<em>Monsters of Murdac</em> is a commercial port of an earlier game titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/avon-monsters-of-murdac\">Murdac</a>, first implemented in the early 1980s on the University of Cambridge's Phoenix computer (an IBM System/370 mainframe).  This text adventure takes the you into the isolated forest of Murdac: wild and impenetrable, always there just beyond the edge of your village yet never divulging its secrets.<br><br>One day, a meeting with the village Wise Woman takes a turn for the strange as the reputed witch consults her fortunes and proclaims that the time is right for you to set out on a quest deep into Murdac.  Following her instructions you perform the necessary rite to open up a path among the trees, and follow it deep into the forest, not knowing quite what to expect - save for the old woman's mutterings about ogres, cannibals, manticores and other none-too-reassuring terms.<br><br>This game was later re-released in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/avon-monsters-of-murdac\">a double-pack with the game Avon</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Topologika+Software+Ltd%2e\">Topologika</a>.",
