  "description": "<i>Zap't'Balls</i> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pang\">Pang</a>. One or two players have 80 screens of balls to clear, by firing a rope vertically so that a ball will hit it. Upon doing this it splits into two balls of half the size, unless it is at the smallest size, at which point it will disappear. Each screen must be cleared within a time limit. Contact with a ball costs the player a life.<br><br>",
