  "description": "The aim in <i>Loco-Motion</i> is to get your train from London to Madrid in a cross-continent race through ten countries. You must guide your train against hazards placed by the locals, such as trees, roads and blockades, and potentially parts of the track having been torn up. A temporary pause mode allows you to plan a route, while coal and water can be collected to boost your score. Up to four players can take it in turns. ",
