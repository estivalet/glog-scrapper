  "description": "<i>Sonic Invader</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=arcade\">Space Invaders</a> variant with the same basic gameplay as the arcade original. The game contains sixteen game variations but these are essentially just different configurations of the same game. It is possible to play the game alone or with two or four players. With two player it can be played in co-op with a single score or in a competition where each player has its own score. With four players, two teams with two players in each compete. Another option is to turn on invisible invaders which feature aliens that occasionally disappear. There are two difficulty levels, normal or high skill, with the latter containing more bullets and faster attackers.",
