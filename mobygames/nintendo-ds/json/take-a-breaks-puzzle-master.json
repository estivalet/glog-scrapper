  "description": "'Take A Break's Puzzle Master' is a collection of puzzles based on the British puzzling magazine series. In the game players must solve a variety of puzzles in order to beat the Puzzle Master (a little crown character who somehow resembles a king) and achieve the Puzzle Master crown.<br><br>The puzzles consist of Crosswords, Arrowwords, Sudoku, Codebreakers, Conundrums (anagram puzzles) and Picture Posers (only playable after winning a trophy in Puzzle Master Mode and later playable in Freestyle Mode). When starting each profile from scratch (or any time after), players can choose their preferred puzzle preferences by sliding the stylus left or right for each puzzle category shown on screen (Drag the icon right to the puzzles you like to play best).<br><br>The game includes two modes: Puzzle Master Mode (where you must solve puzzles within the allotted time in a sequence to earn a trophy until you reach the Puzzle Master rank) and Freestyle (select any one of 6 puzzle categories to play at any time, as well as getting a fair idea of what to expect in Puzzle Master Mode).<br><br>Gameplay mainly utilises the Nintendo DS stylus where players can either drag letters and numbers or just to tap them into the game's keyboard layout. Players can also choose to skip a puzzle if it is too difficult, as well as using hints to help them if they get stuck (which also includes a time penalty). The Puzzle Master himself guides players on what they need to do throughout the puzzles.<br><br>",
