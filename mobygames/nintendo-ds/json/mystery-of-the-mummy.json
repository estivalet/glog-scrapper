  "description": "<i>The Mystery of the Mummy</i> was inspired by <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,117718/\">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>. The player is Sherlock Holmes in this point-and-click first-person adventure game.<br><br>Lord Montcalfe, a well-known Egyptologist, is missing and is believed by the police to have committed suicide. His daughter, Elisabeth, insists that he is still alive and calls upon her fiancé's cousin, Sherlock Holmes, to prove her theories.  Arriving at the manor, Holmes finds that Lord Montcalfe was suffering from a deep paranoia. It seems he had made a terrible mistake and triggered what he believed to be a mummy's curse. Trying to shield himself and others from that curse, he had booby trapped his own home with elaborate locks, some of which were designed to kill anyone who tried to tamper with them.<br><br>Holmes investigates mostly in solitary fashion without the aid of his normal sidekick, Watson. Other people in the game appear only in the cut-scenes. Puzzles become more difficult as the story progresses. Find illusive inventory objects and read many documents for clues as you search the secret passages and elaborately decorated rooms of the Montcalfe Manor.",
