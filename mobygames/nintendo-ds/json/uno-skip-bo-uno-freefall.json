  "description": "This cartridge contains three games, a compilation of two GBA ports: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/uno-skip-bo\">Uno / Skip-Bo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Uno+Freefall\">Uno Freefall</a>. The Uno and Skip-Bo card games come with different styles of play:<ul>\n<li>Endless: no win conditions. After each round the amount of points and number of rounds won is shown.</li>\n<li>Points: play until a specific amount of points has been met.</li>\n<li>Rounds: win a specific number of rounds.</li>\n<li>Survival: all players start with a set number of points. At the end of each round points are deducted from the losing players. When all points are gone, the player is eliminated.</li></ul>There are also three special modes:<ul>\n<li>Challenge Mode: play five levels with different win conditions.</li>\n<li>Endurance Mode: maximize the score by winning as many times as possible.</li>\n<li>Timed Mode: keep scoring until time runs out.</li></ul>The third game, <i>Uno Freefall</i> is a falling-block puzzle game with the Uno cards, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tetris\">Tetris</a>. Players need to make matches based on colors or numbers. Three like cards, three skips or a combination of two like cards and two skips must be matched to make them disappear (horizontally, vertically of L-shaped). More extensive matches lead to combos. The action cards have new functions. They freeze the row timer for a second, add one second back, uncover two random facedown cards, or change a card to any of the four colors.<br><br>\nBefore each game players can choose a background and music track. Next to the classic mode, two groups of other playing styles are available. The special modes are:<ul>\n<li>Flippy Mode: when a match is made, all adjacent cards are flipped.</li>\n<li>Perfect Match Mode: each card needs to be placed in the corresponding spot to match them all.</li>\n<li>Timed Mode: reach a target score with a time limit.</li></ul>The Vs. AI modes are:<ul>\n<li>Classic Mode: stay in the game longer than the opponents.</li>\n<li>High Score Mode: be the first to reach a set amount of points.</li>\n<li>Timed Mode: have the highest score when time runs out.</li></ul>Both hot seat and wireless multiplayer games for up to four players are supported.",
