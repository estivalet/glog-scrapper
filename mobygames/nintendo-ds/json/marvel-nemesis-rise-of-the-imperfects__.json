  "description": "<i>Marvel Nemesis</i>, the fighting game that pits Marvel Comics' most famous characters against the Imperfects created by Electronic Arts, received its own version for the Nintendo DS, with unique arenas, modes and features.<br><br>The game's main mode is Arcade mode. It allows players to control each available character through three campaigns (short, medium and long) that have to be taken on in order. The game contains eighteen characters (ten Marvel characters and eight Imperfects, same as in the console version) but only three characters can be selected from the start: Wolverine, the Human Torch and Spider-Man. Beating a campaign allows the unlocking of further characters. The Play Now mode allows quick bouts utilizing unlocked characters and arenas. A multiplayer mode is also available.<br><br>During a fight, characters are controlled through both buttons and the touch screen. Attacks, throws, blocks and jumps are controlled through the four face buttons. The right shoulder button engages a power modifier for attacks. Since the arenas are three-dimensional, a lock can be toggled that always keeps the player's character looking toward the enemy. The touch screen is used for invoking superpowers (flight/teleportation/web swinging and others), the specifics being different for each character. It is also used for performing finishing moves: areas on the screen flash and have to be hit in time for the move to be performed.<br><br>The ten available arenas are usually several levels high and feature many objects that can be picked up and thrown. The environments are destructible, and levels near streets feature traffic that needs to be avoided (or that the enemy can be thrown into).<br><br>After a fight is won, battle points are awarded for time and health left as well as performed finishing moves. Sometimes it is also possible to wager points before a battle. The points function as a currency for the Comic Store. The store allows the purchase of characters and arenas as well as alternate costumes and concept art, but only if the necessary campaigns in Arcade mode have been completed.",
