  "description": "One dark and stormy night, a lightning storm struck a house.  This freak storm brought to life all sorts of strange creatures who began scurrying around the house causing trouble.  It also brought to life a household fridge magnet, called Mag Kid!  As Mag Kid, it's your job to stop these strange creatures and help the people living in the house.<br><br><i>Slide Adventure: Mag Kid</i> is an action game for the Nintendo DS that comes bundled with a special peripheral.  The peripheral plugs into the bottom of the player's DS and acts like a stand, but it also contains a sensor similar to that of an optical mouse.  Players control Mag Kid by sliding their DS around along any flat surface.<br><br>Mag Kid can't actually move very far on his own - he's limited to sliding around flat surfaces such as tables.  Players need to guide him into other objects - such as books and pencil cases - to get him transported to other areas of the house.  Mag Kid can ram into enemies - when he does this, they connect onto him and he absorbs their powers such as spears and bubbles (which can be fired using the A Button).  Mag Kid can even connect up multiple enemies to himself - but as he does, the magnetic link gets weaker and it's more likely to break apart.",
