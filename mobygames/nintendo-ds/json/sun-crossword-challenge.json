  "description": "'The Sun Crossword Challenge' is a collection of 510 crossword puzzles for players to solve based on one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious tabloid newspapers.<br><br>The game offers players to solve the puzzles either with 'Coffee-Time' (straightforward clues) or 'Cryptic' (a crossword clue that may be found within itself and will need a lot of brains). Options on the main menu and in-game include choosing the preferred background music, check for errors either after a puzzle's completion or automatically, and to choose the player's preferred handwriting orientation (left or right-handed).<br><br>When solving a crossword puzzle, players must use the stylus to enter letters onto the grid using one of two preferred methods: Handwriting (where players need to trace each letter into the character entry box one at a time) and Keyboard (where players must tap letters on the Touch Screen arranged into a computer keyboard one at a time onto the grid).<br><br>During gameplay the Undo and Redo buttons can be used at anytime, as well as the eraser to delete any incorrect letters. All letters in each crossword puzzle must be entered using the Pen icon, although the Pencil icon can also be used to write potential letters. Hints can also be used at anytime but these cost players a minute towards the completion of puzzles. Any mistakes after the completion of each puzzle also add to the time penalty.<br><br>At the Pause Menu, players can resume the puzzle, change the game options, restart the puzzle, save the current puzzle progress and return to the main menu.",
