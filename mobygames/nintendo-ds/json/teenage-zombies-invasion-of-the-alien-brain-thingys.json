  "description": "<i>Teenage Zombies: Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingys</i> is a puzzle/platformer in which the player controls three zombie teenagers.<br><br>Alien Brains have invaded the Earth and are forcing humans to do their will by the use of mind-control. The only ones not affected by the mind control are the brainless zombies, who have risen from the grave, disturbed by the invasion.<br><br>The three zombie teenagers, Lori &quot;Lefty&quot; Lopez, Finnigan &quot;Fins&quot; Magee and Zack &quot;Half-Pipe&quot; Boyd, set out once they find out that the alien brains are much better than human ones and are eager to find the mastermind behind the whole invasion, the Big Brain. <br><br>Each zombie teenager has different powers that the player will have to use to bypass the different puzzles in the game. Lefty, a former basketball player has a long reach with which high ledges can be reached. Half-Pipe is missing his lower body, but uses his skateboard for movement and he can crawl through tight spaces. Fins, as a former swimmer, has mutated as a zombie and has grown tentacles with which he can climb walls.",
