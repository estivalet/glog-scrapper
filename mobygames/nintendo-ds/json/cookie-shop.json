  "description": "In <i>Cookie Shop</i>, you are the owner of a bakery and try to work your way to the top. You start off at the least popular floor in a shopping mall and compete each month to become the best bakery there. You learn new recipes through minigames and that way make them available for sale in your shop. You have to keep an eye out on your amount of ingredients and the sales prices. The game also offers a very simple simulation-part in which you can interact with other shop owners, exchange gifts and build relationships. Cookie Shop is a game without an ending and it's up to the player how he/she expands the shop. ",
