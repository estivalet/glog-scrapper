  "description": "Different from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-3-mutant-nightmare\">console cousins</a>, this one is reminiscent of the old side-scrolling days of the arcade and NES versions, but with the same story.  There are 50 stages to play and not only includes fighting, but also utilizing the stylus and dual screen of the DS to use multiple turtles and their unique, individual skills to solve puzzles and avoid traps and obstacles as well.  Four players can also play at one time utilizing Wi-Fi.",
