  "description": "<i>Worms: Open Warfare</i> isn't a follow-up to the <i>Worms</i> series, but rather a new version made specifically for contemporary handheld consoles. Instead of keeping on with the 3D style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/worms-3d\">Worms 3D</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/worms-4-mayhem\">Worms 4: Mayhem</a>, the game goes back to its roots, featuring the classical 2D gameplay and smaller weapon set from the first Worms games.<br><br>Each player has a team of worms that has to battle it out against opponent teams in a destructible terrain, with several wacky weapons at their disposal, similar to artillery games. The player can either opt for the single-player mode, competing in custom matches or setting challenges against computer teams; or play against human opponents in hotswap or multiplayer modes. The DS version features single cartridge multiplayer and the PSP version features wireless Ad-Hoc functionality.",
