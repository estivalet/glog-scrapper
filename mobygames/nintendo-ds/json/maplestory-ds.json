  "description": "This single-player spinoff of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/maplestory\">MapleStory</a> provides a story-based look at the world of MapleStory. The player can choose one of four different classes; the player starts the game with one of two unlocked, depending on a quiz they start the game with, and can unlock the other three over the course of the game. Like its MMORPG cousin, <i>MapleStory DS</i> is an action platform game with RPG elements; each character starts with a basic attack, and can be customized with extra spells that can be mapped onto the DS's buttons.<br><br>While this game and <i>MapleStory</i> are separate, <i>MapleStory DS</i> does have unlockable codes that let the player obtain items in the MMORPG.",
