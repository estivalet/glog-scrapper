  "description": "<i>Battleship</i> is a turn-based strategy game based on the movie of the same name. While on a training mission, a fleet of US soldiers is trapped by a bubble and attacked by space ships. In order to survive, they have to fight against the aliens during 26 campaign missions. The goal is usually to eradicate all enemies, but sometimes there are other goals like retreating or defending a certain ship.<br><br>During each turn, the player moves ships and uses them to attack the enemy. Variables which need to be taken into consideration are for example the ship's range, its size (for navigation), the point of attack (attacking from  behind is more effective), the water depth (some vessels are more effective in low or deep water) and the unit's health (a unit becomes less effective in offense and defense when it loses health). The commander, who changes from mission to mission, grants a changing passive boost to its unit and has a special move (basically a stronger version of the boost) which can be activated when a special bar is filled up by defeating enemies - however, the alien commander has one of those abilities, too.<br><br>While most ships only differ in size and range, there are also some special units: supply vessels are important to keep a steady flow of missiles and fuel (required for every move), repair vessels are useful to keep other units alive and rubber rafts can capture ports. When two bigger ships meet, the player can optionally enter duel mode and directly aim and shoot missiles. Outside the campaign, the player can play skirmishes (replaying finished campaign missions with a commander of choice).",
