  "description": "<h3>www.nintendo.com - Nintendo DS (from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/goldeneye-rogue-agent_/adblurbs\">Ad Blurbs</a>)</h3><h3>He's golden. And we mean that in a bad way.</h3><p></p><b>Wireless multiplayer deathmatches. Woo hoo!</b><p></p>GoldenEye: Rogue Agent shows off the Nintendo DS as a great platform for first-person shooters. The action is fast and intense in this explosive tale of power and betrayal.<p></p><b>Features</b><ul><li>Epic, six-mission solo campaign</li><li>Sharpen your lethal edge against infamous Bond villains in DS-exclusive Virtual Training mode</li><li>Wireless multiplayer mayhem for up to eight players with only one Game Card.</ul></li><p></p>Kicked out of MI6 for excess brutality, your character's, ahem, unique skill set gets him recruited by Auric Goldfinger. A nasty encounter with Dr. No costs him an eye, but Goldfinger’s technicians replace it with a gold-hued, synthetic and upgradeable eye, earning him the name &quot;GoldenEye.&quot; Now it’s payback time, Dr. No.<p></p>On your quest for revenge, you'll encounter such legendary Bond baddies as Oddjob, Scaramanga and Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye: Rogue Agent lets you slip into the dark side as a ruthless and unpredictable bad guy with lots of big weapons and cool devices. The GoldenEye gadget, an infinitely cool device worthy of Q himself, and the heads-up-display (HUD) let you see enemies through cover, hack electronics and weapons, deflect damage, monitor ammo levels, decode locks and more.<p></p>You can wield two weapons at once or go one-on-one with a muscular melee fighting system lets you throw and cold-cock enemies, seize hostages and more. Left and right-handed gameplay controls, plus stylus and thumb-pad play, take full advantage of the DS's unique touch-screen capabilities.<p></p>One of the keys to GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is its array of control schemes. The touch screen isn't going to be for everyone, and some will want inverted controls or auto aiming and leveling. There's no greater disappointment than playing a first-person shooter and being unable to control your player's movement, leaving you a sitting duck. Once you find the control scheme that works for you, you'll be scampering through each level with guns blazing.<p></p>When you come across a weapon on the ground, you will need to tap the touch screen to pick it up. The bottom left and bottom right each represent a hand. Tap the bottom left to pick up the gun with your left hand, and the right corner for your right hand. The L and R Buttons are your triggers for this rapid-fire adventure.<p></p>The story mode follows the same story as the GCN game. It's a solid, unpretentious FPS. But what sets GoldenEye DS apart are the righteously great multiplayer modes.<p></p>If you have one Game Card, up to eight players can wirelessly frag each other. Just host a game and have your friends choose Download Play from the DS's menu. If you and your friends have multiple Game Cards, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent offers four game modes and a wider variety of characters and maps.<p></p><b>Bottom Line</b><p></p>The muliplayer arenas make GoldenEye: Rogue Agent a great title for the Nintendo DS.",
