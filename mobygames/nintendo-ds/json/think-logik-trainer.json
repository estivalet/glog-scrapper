  "description": "<i>Think: Logik Trainer</i> is a Nintendo DS port of a popular German board game. It is a kind of mental training game which trains different abilities like language, math, spatial awareness, memory, imaginative and reasoning power. There is also a multiplayer option. The game design is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Nintendo+Brain+Game+series\">Nintendo Brain Game</a> series.<br><br>For example one exercise is mental math. You have to write down the results with your touch pen correctly and as fast as possible to gain a higher IQ score, which Logik Trainer calls &quot;Think Ratio&quot; here, which can be saved on the cartridge for later to improve your training results. Another exercise is to learn terms, pictures or numbers by heart, look at them for two minutes and then write down as many of the numbers or words as you have memorized. All in all there are over 18 different disciplines to train. <br><br>The multiplayer mode works on the same DS; every participant plays after one another. there are two events, marathon (every exercise is trained) or sprint (random exercises are trained), to be solved as fast as possible.",
