Just as Sissel is about to give up a voice tells you that you're the only one who can help the girl because as a ghost Sissel has gained a few powers. <br><br>The gameplay in Ghost Trick consists of possessing whatever is nearby and manipulating inanimate objects, in other words as a ghost Sissel has the power to perform tricks. Sissel also has the ability to go back 4 minutes before a person was killed to try and change their fate. Moving between objects and using tricks at the right time is the key to progressing through the game and preventing a death from happening. <br><br>The story of the game will take the player through various scenarios where Sissel can help prevent the death of a living being while finding out more about his own death. However Sissel is told he only has until dawn to find out why he died or his soul will disappear from the world of the living.",
