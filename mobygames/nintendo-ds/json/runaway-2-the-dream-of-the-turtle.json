  "description": "At the end of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/runaway-a-road-adventure\">Runaway: A Road Adventure</a>, Brian and Gina finally had the time to be together on a tropical island called Mala, but the good times don't last long. One day they decide to go on a trip and fly over the island in a plane. Everything goes well until the engines suddenly catch fire and the plane makes his way down. Since there is only one parachute, Brian gives it to Gina and throws her out the plane. Brian survives the crash but he now has to find Gina once again. <br><br>His search in this 2D adventure takes him around the globe even to the icy regions of Alaska. Along the way the player will have to solve many riddles for which they will need to talk to people or find items scattered around in the environments. The player will also meet old friends from <i>Runaway: A Road Adventure</i> such as the hacker Sushi Douglas and many new characters are introduced as well.",
