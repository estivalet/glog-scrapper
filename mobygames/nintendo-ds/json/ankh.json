  "description": "<i>Ankh</i> is a remake of the 1998 RISC OS point-and-click adventure <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ankh-the-tales-of-mystery\">Ankh: The Tales of Mystery</a>. Assil, a young Egyptian architect's son, steals the key of the great pyramid in Cairo to throw a party, but once inside he accidentally knocks over some ancient urns. Struck by a death curse of a disturbed mummy, he has very little time left. At the same time, however, he receives the magical ankh, and he may be about to meet the woman of his dreams. The pharaoh is the only one who can help you, but you are just a pleb, so you need to travel through the Egyptian locale and find a way to attract his attention.<br><br>The game uses a 3D engine with a fixed camera and everything is controlled by the mouse. Upon hovering over items, the appropriate action appears: walking, running, looking, picking up, talking or using. Items are gathered in the inventory at the top of the screen. You can examine them, use them in the environment, or combine to create a new item. At certain moments, you control multiple characters and need to exchange items to solve the puzzles. The tab button brings up a list of all open quests.<br><br>Although there is no time dependency, the curse's effects become visible when the magic takes over control of Assil's body, and mystical tattoos appear progressively. The graphics and humour are reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=LucasArts\">LucasArts</a> adventures, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Telltale+Games\">Telltale Games</a>, with many ex-LucasArts employees aboard, took on an advisory role for the project.",
