  "description": "In <i>Hotel Giant DS</i> the player is responsible for managing a hotel. In principle the game is played similar to <moby game=\"Hotel Giant 2\">Hotel Giant 2<moby> but adjusted to the capabilities of the platform. The first big difference is that there is no classic free playing mode but only 15 missions where the player needs to reach certain goals. Mostly the player takes over a half-finished hotel and needs to finish furnishing the rooms. The available items were reduced to the most necessary.<br><br>When the hotel opens its doors the most time is spent with attending to the cusomer's complaints. After beating a mission it can be played again with self-determined goals. The game is played in real-time but can be paused at any time. A save option is available after every day. There is also a mini game when the player doesn't want to hire cleaners: troubles are indicated with a flash on the mini map. When clicking on it the player needs to make a fast move with the stylus.",
