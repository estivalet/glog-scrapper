  "description": "<i>Eco-Creatures: Save the Forest</i> is a real-time strategy game where the player controls creatures called Ecolis (squirrels), Ecoby (flying squirrels) and Ecomon (beavers).  The story is about a fantasy world where a beautiful forest called the Mana Woods is overrun by monsters and pollution.  The player must help these creatures reclaim their land, but not only do they control them, they can take care of them, developing new abilities and skills.<br><br>Each units have unique abilities: the <i>ecolis</i> grow healing trees that distributes health throughout the other units, the <i>ecomon</i> transports special items and news to Dorian (a elder creature of the woods that helps the player along during the game) and <i>ecoby</i> build bridges and dams which helps units cross bodies of water.<br><br>Players must also watch their units &quot;Mana&quot; which can determine how they will fight during a battle.  The lower the &quot;Mana&quot; the better the chance they will flee while the highest will have the creature fight till the bitter end.  These are determined of how players react to situational cutscenes throughout the game.<br><br>The gameplay mostly consists of using the stylus pen, selecting various options through interface menus to do multiple things, such as selecting creatures or cast spells against enemies.  There are 40 missions to play in as well as multiplayer abilities either through Wi-Fi or game sharing using one cartridge.  Players can compete against each other head-to-head or share info and stats as well use custom made maps.",
