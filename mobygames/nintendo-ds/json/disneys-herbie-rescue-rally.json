  "description": "Herbie the Love Bug rides again!  In this racing title for the Nintendo DS, Herbie's new owner Louise Noble is trying to find a way to save her family's animal sanctuary from being turned into a garbage dump by the sinister E. Vile corporation. In order to save the sanctuary, Louise and Herbie must win a cross state race against Edward Vile himself, for a $1 million dollar reward.<br><br>The game itself allows players to drive across four courses, each with different paths with unique triggered events in each race, such as avalanches, tornadoes or other natural disasters. <br><br>Players can compete in four different race modes:<ul>\n<li>Car circuit races (one or two player - both players need a copy of the game to play) - A race against a human opponent to cross the finish line before the rest of the cars.</li><br>\n<li>Head to head races (one or two player - both players need a copy of the game to play) - A race against a human opponent to cross the finish line first.</li><br>\n<li>Time trials (one player) - A race to see how long players can race before time runs out.  Collecting clock tokens adds more time.</li><br>\n<li>Speed trials (one player) - A race to see how far a player can get in a certain time.  Speed boosts add more acceleration to Herbie.</li></ul>",
