  "description": "<i>Code Lyoko</i> is a game based on the French animated television series. Five boarding school students - Ulrich, Odd, Jeremy and Yumi - fight against a digital entity named X.A.N.A. They travel to the virtual world of Lyoko and help their virtual friend Aelita fend off X.A.N.A.s forces.<br><br>The game follows both aspects of the kids' lives, and the player can enjoy 3D Action Role Playing within the world of Lyoko and 2D Adventuring in the real world.<br><br>The game is made of 15 chapters, and each chapter is split into two portions. One portion is a PC-style 2D point-and-click adventure, where you take control of one of the characters to visit different locations, talk to people, gather items, and generally watch the story unfold. The other portion is a 3D action level where you swap among characters and use their abilities to fight monsters, hop between platforms, or climb up hillsides in search of the tower that'll put and end to whatever problem is currently pestering the real world. Occasionally, the player has to solve touch-screen puzzles and pass vehicle-based levels.<br><br>\n",
