  "description": "<i>Akuma no Satsujin K?kai</i> is a mystery adventure game based on <i>Kindaichi Sh?nen no Jikenbo</i> manga series featuring Hajime Kindaichi, a high-school student and a grandson of a renowned detective Kousuke Kindaichi, who has a knack for solving crimes with his brilliant deduction despite being a rather mediocre student, as the protagonist. As always, he is accompanied with his childhood friend, Miyuki Nanase, an attractive looking lass with good grades.<br><br>The game puts you in a role of Hajime Kindaichi who finds himself on a luxury liner named Luna entangled in a murder mystery. The story is split into chapters, and each chapter contains files. At the beginning of each chapter, as the story advanced, Hajime gets involved in a new case to be solved. After getting on a case at hand, the player will start investigation and gathering information. By talking to other characters and investigating areas of interest you will gather evidence and testimony that will help you in your reasoning. By doing the inference your gathered information will level up which will indicate the validity of your reasoning. Before doing the reasoning you will be able to organize and verify gathered information and clues, some of which may be carried onto the next chapter. At the end of each chapter there is an epilogue and a ranking for your process of solving the crime.<br><br>During conversation with other characters, dialogue and both characters will be visible on the upper screen while dialogue options are present for selection on the lower screen. Aside from game displaying the player character, the dialogue presentation is very similar to that of a visual novel with more selections and less clicking to just advance through sea of endless descriptions and choiceless conversations. In between the dialogues you'll be able to use map of the ship to visit different floors and rooms in search for evidence. Hajime will also keep info on characters he met in his notebook, as well as basic case info and any relevant evidence you wish to go through again.<br><br>As a bonus to the main story, from the main menu the player can also access Reasoning Quiz 100 which questions are obtained during the actual gameplay through the main story. Also, Hajime can play a game of Shougi with police inspector he meets on the luxury liner in the game story.",
