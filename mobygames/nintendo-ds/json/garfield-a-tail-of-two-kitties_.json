  "description": "Garfield receives a message from Prince The Twelfth that he is invited to a royal dinner at Carlyle castle. Not one to pass up a chance of eating some lasagna, Garfield voyages outside his hotel room on a journey to the castle to get some grub.<br><br><i>Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties</i> is a side-scrolling platformer. Garfield makes his way through eighteen 3D environments that are on fixed 2D paths. Sometimes these paths occasionally branch off into different directions. Garfield travels through various locales such as building rooftops, up a huge tree, and even a hedge maze. Garfield starts each level with 9 lives and loses a life for each hit he takes from the various obstacles strewn throughout each level, Garfield has the ability to jump and he can climb up certain walls, Also, if the player blows into the microphone, it will make Garfield meow which is sometimes used to interact with a stage such as waking up sleeping bats. Each platforming level contains several food item icons to collect, although collecting them isn't required to finish a level. After a platforming level is completed, it gets unlocked in a Timed Missions mode which lets the player attempt to beat a level as fast as they can.<br><br>In between some of the platforming levels, Garfield will see an area through his eyes via a first person perspective. Players are to use the stylus to look around and find a hot spot in order to complete these parts",
