  "description": "The DS title <i>SpongeBob SquarePants: Plankton's Robotic Revenge</i> is different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wii/spongebob-squarepants-planktons-robotic-revenge\">main console game of the same name</a>. It is a 3D shooter shown from an almost top-down perspective with only the story being identical to the other version. Plankton finds a bunch of batteries dropped in the ocean by a cargo ship and sees an opportunity to use these batteries to steel the Krabby Patty secret recipe. Soon after this, he shows up at the Krusty Krab in his giant robot and takes the safe with the formula. The characters need to stop him, defeat his robot army and retrieve the formula.<br><br>For each level the player can choose to play as Mr. Krabs, Patrick, Sandy, SpongeBob or Squidward, each with identical abilities. The characters need to navigate various environments, including hazards such as disappearing and moving platforms. There are also mines and gas that need to be avoided, and whirlpools that can kill the character instantly. Along the way robots that are encountered need to be defeated. Sometimes there is a boss at the end, who can be defeated using a close melee attack or by shooting from a distance. There are different weapons available, for instance the pickle blaster, reef blower and portable tartar sauce. Sprockets are the main currency in the game to upgrade the weapons. They are left behind by defeated enemies or can be found by smashing objects. The game is played on the bottom screen and the top screen shows the current level, health status and the number of collected sprockets. ",
