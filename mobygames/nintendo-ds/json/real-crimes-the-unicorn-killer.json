  "description": "In 1979, the decomposing body of Holly Maddux was found inside a trunk, hidden in the closet of the apartments of Ira Einhorn, an icon of counterculture and activism of the sixties. Ira was nicknamed &quot;Unicorn&quot;, a translation of his German surname. Jennifer Lourdes and Alan Michaels, two FBI investigators, set out to hunt the &quot;Unicorn Killer&quot;, searching for clues in locations related to the case.<br><br><i>Real Crimes: The Unicorn Killer</i> is a hidden object game based on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Einhorn\">real case from the seventies</a>. The objective is to find and click on all the items from a list at the left side of the screen, on locations filled with scattered objects. At the start, there's an option to play with or without a timer. One of the list entries is written in green, to indicate the need of an extra step to get it or, in some cases, that it's a riddle instead of the object name. To acquire this special item, the player must use the object stored in the inventory, by dragging and dropping it on another one in the scenery (for example, a pencil on a notepad).<br><br>Boards of the traditional Japanese game of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/go-professional-ii\">Go</a> can be found in some scenes. They are puzzles, where the player has only one move to surround the black pieces with white ones and win an extra hint. The hint button shows the exact location of one of the required objects. More hints can also be earned on the occasional crime lab visits, where various mini-games with forensic themes have to be completed, like matching fingerprints, a concentration game with blood samples, jigsaw puzzles and other similar challenges.",
