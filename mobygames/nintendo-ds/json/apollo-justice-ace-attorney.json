  "description": "It's seven years after the events seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=013388320103\">Trials and Tribulations</a>, and Phoenix Wright has shouted his last &quot;Objection!&quot;.  Taking his place in the court is a new <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ace+Attorney\">Ace Attorney</a>, the young rookie, Apollo Justice.  Does he have what it takes to clear his clients of their guilt?<br><br><i>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</i> is the fourth game in the <i>Ace Attorney</i> series, and the first to be designed from the ground up for the Nintendo DS.  In addition to the now-familiar courtroom action and investigation, Apollo also gets to take part in forensic investigation, such as taking plaster casts and dusting for prints.  Players can also examine their inventory in three dimensions, as clues can sometimes be hidden out of normal sight.<br><br>Apollo also has a special talent - the ability to perceive people's nervous habits.  If a witness' testimony appears to be rock solid, Apollo can still crack it by taking note of their nervous habit that they perform whenever they're lying, and catch them in the act by shouting out &quot;GOTCHA!&quot;.",
