  "description": "Nina Kalenkow, a beautiful woman living in Berlin, Germany, reaches her father's workplace at the Museum one night just to find out he has disappeared without a trace. After finding out the carelessness of the police department about the case, she then decides to search for him herself.<br><br>From that moment on, and with the help of one of her father's colleagues, the young Max Gruber, Nina is introduced to a conspiracy between governments and secret organizations, related to the vast and unexplained explosion that took place in 1908 in the Tunguska Region in Russia, which her father was investigating. The journey will take them all around the globe in the search for clues that will eventually reveal lots of secrets as they get closer to Nina's father. Nina is the protagonist, but Max can also be controlled during certain parts.<br><br><i>Secret Files: Tunguska</i> is a classic third-person point-and-click adventure game clearly inspired by the old classics, presented against pre-rendered backgrounds with 3D models of the characters, and CGI animations for certain events. While playing, important clues are stored in a journal. The inventory is shown at the bottom of the screen, selecting an item and hovering it over other items or various locations will show if there is a use for the item or not. Additionally, if in-game &quot;Help&quot; is enabled, pressing a button in the bottom right corner reveals the location of all on-screen items Nina can investigate.",
