Several cell phones in Japan are also capable of receiving the broadcasts. The bottom screen of the Nintendo DS is used to switch channels, and the top screen is for viewing the TV broadcast. <br><br>Apart from the user interface and sleek menus, there is also a classic game programmed into the application software titled Game &amp; Watch: Fire. In Game &amp; Watch: Fire, the player controls two firemen who carry a trampoline with the task of safely catching a number of people falling from a burning building. The game play is quite simple only requiring players to move left and right to bounce the victims to safety. Each level starts with 3 lives, if 3 jumpers hit the ground then the game is over. <br><br>\n",
