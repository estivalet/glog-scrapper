  "description": "The Nintendo DS version of <i>Flushed Away</i> (based on the 2006 Aardman Animations film of the same name) allows you to control Roddy St. James, Rita and the Jammy Dodger (Rita's preferred mode of transport) across a variety of levels to stop the evil Toad and his diabolical scheme to take over Ratropolis! The DS version also includes unique characters not seen from the animated film.<br><br>The main gameplay involves guiding Roddy and Rita through several platform-based levels, using an arsenal of weapons such as a cocktail sword to defeat enemies along the way. These levels also include a number of items (including Quid, which can be used to upgrade the Jammy Dodger's performance) to enhance the current character's abilities. In certain levels, players also need to control the Jammy Dodger to avoid The Toad and his amphibian allies in 3D environments.<br><br>This version also includes 3 exclusive minigames (which all utilise the Nintendo DS stylus) to play at any time (only unlocked as you progress throughout the adventure).",
