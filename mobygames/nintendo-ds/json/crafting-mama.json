  "description": "<i>Crafting Mama</i> is a spinoff to the DS hit <i>Cooking Mama</i>, with very similar gameplay. First, you must choose a craft to make from the menu provided, but you need to unlock most of them by making the other crafts. Like <i>Cooking Mama</i>, the game has short mini-games for each step in the process. Sometimes, when you are done making the object, you can customize the object from a list of colors, patterns, and fabrics. The mini-games rely heavily on the DS touch screen and stylus, and some use the DS microphone. Some of the crafts can be given to Mama to wear, as she is on the top screen for most of the game.<br><br>There are also a few modes besides the main mode. Mystery Craft allows you to make a craft without knowing what the craft is. All of these crafts can be played in the main mode also. Craft Collection lets you play mini-games and change the appearance of your crafts. Some crafts need to be modified to be checked off as done, which is required to complete the game. All of these mini-games are also in Multiplayer Mode, which can be played with a single cartridge. You can also share the apron craft with friends who do not own the game.",
