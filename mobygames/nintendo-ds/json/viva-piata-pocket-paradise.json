  "description": "Grab your shovel and tend a virtual garden with <i>\nViva Piñata: Pocket Paradise</i>!  Dig, plant, water and landscape in an effort to attract many different species of Piñata in the hope of becoming a master gardener.\n<br><br>\n<i>Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise</i> is essentially a handheld version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=882224277273\">Viva Piñata</a> with some tweaks and improvements.  The game features a more streamlined tutorial mode, as well as more tie-ins to the TV show.  Video clips from the show are given as rewards for completing certain parts of the game.  There are also 'Episodes' - mini missions where the player must complete a certain task to succeed.\n<br><br>\nOf course, there is also the standard mode of play - casually attract Piñata as you see fit, by using different plants and other Piñata as incentives.  Earn awards for growing plants well, attracting Piñata, and encouraging them to romance with others.  You can even trade Piñata with friends by using the Wireless connection.",
