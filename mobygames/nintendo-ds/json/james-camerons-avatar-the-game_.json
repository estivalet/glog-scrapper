  "description": "Although <i>James Cameron's Avatar: The Game</i> is named after the movie, the story itself doesn't follow the plot of the film. \nInstead the player takes on the role of a young Na'vi warrior Nok. The game begins when the balance of nature that stood for thousands of years is threatened by the &quot;sky people&quot;. Nok's home is attacked by the men of Dr. Ossman, a genius scientist working for the RDA Corporation and Nok is chosen for a sacred quest. Nok will discover the secrets of his planet, meet the &quot;sky people&quot; and will become the hero who will save his tribe.<br><br><i>Avatar</i> is an action adventure game that lets the player explore the world of Pandora in a top-down perspective. The game contains unlockable information about the Avatar universe accessible through a Pandorapedia. Gameplay primarily consists of puzzles and real time combat involving Nok's different attacks. The game is addressed to a young public.\n",
