  "description": "Batman's arch-nemesis, the Joker, has planned yet another insane scheme!  He's pulled off a daring heist and rounded up the worst of the worst of Batman's foes to cause more trouble for Gotham.  Catwoman, Black Manta, Clock King, Gentleman Ghost, Gorilla Grodd and even more troublesome supervillains are each planning their own nefarious schemes.  Luckily, Batman's got some backup of his own - Plastic Man, Blue Beetle, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Red Tornado and Green Arrow are all willing to lend a hand with their own special powers.  Help Batman take down the villains!<br><br><i>Batman: The Brave and The Bold The Videogame</i> is a platformer/beat-'em-up based on the cartoon series of the same name.  The game is single player only, and has you swapping between Batman and another superhero (which differs, depending on the level) to solve puzzles, and take down waves of enemies.  Defeated enemies drop Batman symbols which can be used to purchase various gadgets and upgrades for Batman, such as armour upgrades which increase health, or Batman's light sword.  At the middle and end of the stages are supervillains, which you must defeat to continue and complete the stage.<br><br>After story stages are completed, their corresponding challenges are unlocked.  There are three different types of challenges: Character Challenges, where you must finish a level with a specific character, Boss Rush, where you must defeat both that stage's bosses in one go, and Battle Challenges, where you must defeat waves of enemies to complete them.",
