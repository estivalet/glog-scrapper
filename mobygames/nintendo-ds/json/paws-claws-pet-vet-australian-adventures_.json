  "description": "You can manage your own vet practice with many different types of animal in the Australian outback which are relying on your help. However, with the right treatment they will be restored to health and released back into their own environment. The ranger will be at your side right from the start with help and advice until you can run the practice on your own. He will give you all the information you need, so if you don’t know what to do next, you can turn to him for help. Once you have earned enough money and gained enough experience, you can upgrade your practice and you must also build the animal enclosures, otherwise you will not be able to take them back to the practice for in-patient treatment.<br><br>The treatment and healing of the animals happens on the touch screen. The player can diagnose the illness by touching the different body parts with the stylus. Meanwhile a text appears in the upper screen with the diagnose and the indication which medicine you have to use. In order to lead the practice you can use the personal computer. There you can order all things like medicine and food for the animals or furniture for the house.",
