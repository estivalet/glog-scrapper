  "description": "Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=NTR-AWTJ-JPN\">Game & Watch Collection</a>, <i>Game &amp; Watch Collection 2</i> is a collection of Game &amp; Watch games onto a Nintendo DS cart.  As with the previous collection, it was not available for purchase and could only be obtained through the Japanese points program, Club Nintendo.  The games included are:<br><br><b>Parachute:</b> Parachuters are jumping from the helicopter into the ocean!  Catch them before they fall in and get gobbled up by the shark!<br><br><b>Octopus:</b> Dive underwater and dodge the octopus' tentacles.  Grab the treasure, but don't get too greedy!<br><br><b>Parachute X Octopus:</b> Parachute and Octopus combined into one game!  Catch the parachuters, then dive underwater when prompted to grab the treasure.  Be sure to come back up again before more parachuters start falling!<br><br>Again, each Game &amp; Watch has both the clock and alarm function, like the original Game &amp; Watch toys.",
