  "description": "<i>Otoshi Keiji</i> (meant to be read as <i>Otoshi Deka</i>) is a detective adventure game spanning four cases. You are Jun Kawashima, a rookie detective nicknamed Aloha. Solving the cases is a tri-step process. First part is the investigation of the case origin. What kind of crime was committed, where it happened, and who was the victim. Second part is processing the crime scene where you have to collect evidence, re-create the crime, and look for suspects with motives. The last step is interrogation. Once you have the suspect and necessary clues, you need to get a confession. During interrogation you have five different character modes you can use to get your confession. Mean, angry, positive, indifferent or sympathetic.",
