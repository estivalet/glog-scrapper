  "description": "Don't let the &quot;2010 Edition&quot; fool you - this is based off of the original version of the popular 80's game show <i>Press Your Luck</i>. The garish 1980s set and the flow of the show have both been faithfully replicated in digital form. The game features a single player mode, where the contestant plays through 20 shows of different opponents and increasing difficulty. Alternatively, up to three players can play an episode as contestants in the game's &quot;Party Mode.&quot;<br><br>Gameplay mirrors the game show it is based on. There are two rounds, each with a question phase and a board phase. Players are asked four multiple-choice questions in the question phase. Ringing in first and giving the correct answer nets you 3 spins. The other two players then get a chance to pick their answer to earn 1 spin. Incorrect answers gain no spins.<br><br>In the board phase, players use their accumulated spins to rack up cash. The board &quot;spins&quot; at random until the player hits a button to stop the cycle, earning whatever cash on the space the board stopped on. If the board stops on a cartoon &quot;Whammy,&quot; that contestant's score is set to zero. Four Whammies removes that contestant from the game. The idea is to &quot;press your luck&quot; as long as you can, and then dump remaining spins off on another player in hopes of forcing them into a Whammy.<br><br>As players win games, they unlock new costumes and hairstyles for their avatar.",
