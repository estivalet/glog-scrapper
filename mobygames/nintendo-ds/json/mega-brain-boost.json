The \n      brain produces five wavelengths: alpha, beta, delta, gamma and theta \n      waves. Brain Boost Gamma Wave and Brain Boost Beta Wave are individual \n      games designed to develop the right brain by increasing your recognition \n      of images/shapes/spatial patterns, illustrations and intuition. In Mega \n      Brain Boost, you’ll get both of these previously released titles, plus a \n      third entirely new game! All three games utilize Makoto Shichida’s \n      “right brain development theory” to train your brain.\n    </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n      \n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Get three full brain games on 1 game cartridge!<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Brain Boost Beta Wave includes five different types of progressively \n        difficult brain training games where speed and accuracy count: Find \n        the Match, Shape Recognition, Addition, Remember Sequence and Moving \n        Dots.<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Brain Boost Gamma Wave includes: Remember Colors, Remember Numbers, \n        Remember Circumstances, Remember Faces and Remember Images.<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Plus a third never-before-released third game on the same cartridge \n        that includes: Match the Kanji Characters, Dots, Colors, Find the Goal \n        and Total Amount of Money.<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Two game modes within each: Brain Training and Multiplayer.<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Each game type contains 4 difficulty levels with 20 multiple choice \n        problems in each.<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Receive your overall score for right brain development after \n        completing a brain training series.<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Play a friend in any of the 15 game types to see who’s the bigger \n        brainiac.<br><br>        <p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n          \n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Increase your level of difficulty by answering correctly.
