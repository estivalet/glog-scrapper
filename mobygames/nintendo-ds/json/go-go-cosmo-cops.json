  "description": "When an alien in distress crash-lands on Earth, they have only one choice: deputize two human children into the Cosmo Cops so they can save the day! This 2D platformer is controlled exclusively using the DS's touch screen. The player character swings from platforms using grappling hooks; swiping across the screen allows the player to leap from platform to platform, and to fling themselves through the air towards enemies in order to take them out. The DS is held rotated, giving players a vertically-oriented game field.",
