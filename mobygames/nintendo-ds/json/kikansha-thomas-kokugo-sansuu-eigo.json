  "description": "'Kikansha Thomas: Kokugo Sansuu Eigo' is a Japanese-only edutainment release that allows players to learn with one of the UK's most famous locomotives: Thomas The Tank Engine!<br><br>In this game the player can learn Japanese, arithmetic and English, as well as solving puzzles in the fictional Island of Sodor (the main location setting of the 'Thomas The Tank Engine &amp; Friends' franchise). The subjects are split into 5 separate books found in the 'Story' menu: '???' (Kokugo, teaches players the Japanese language), '????' ?(Sansû, teaches players mathematics), '???' (Eigo, teaches players the English language), '????' (Kakikata, teaches players how to draw) and '???' (Pazuru, includes a variety of puzzles to solve).<br><br>Gameplay mainly involves the Nintendo DS stylus to tap the correct answers to numerous questions, dragging, drawing numbers and so on. The Nintendo DS microphone is also ultilised only for the 'Kokugo' and 'Eigo' categories, where players must say the name of a word shown on the Touch Screen to open several doors in unique mini-games within these categories. <br><br>Each story consists of Thomas carrying out several tasks on the Island of Sodor given by the Fat Controller (known in Japan as ??????????). Before each story, Percy and Gordon are also playable.<br><br>The ??? (zukan, or reference book) is found on the main menu and includes a short summary of all the engines in the 'Thomas The Tank Engine &amp; Friends' series. To add more characters, the player must tap the horn icon on the bottom-right of the Touch Screen while passing by several engines before each activity.<br><br>Also on the main menu is the ??? (omake, or bonus) menu which features a study (allows players to play any minigame they've unlocked during the stories) and even a colouring book that includes 8 character pictures.",
