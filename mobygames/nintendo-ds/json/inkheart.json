  "description": "<i>Inkheart</i> is based on the movie by director Iain Softley and the original fantasy book by German author Cornelia Funke. The game is a classic point-and-click adventure game. You take control of the main characters Mo, his daughter Meggie and Dustfinger, a fire-eater. Mo has been searching for the mysterious book Inkheart for a long time. When he finally discovers it in an old book store, he soon must find out that he is not the only one looking for it. The book puts him and his daughter in danger - and Meggie does not even know her fathers dark secret, that he has a unique magic ability...<br><br>Since books are the central point of the story, it is only fitting that you need to hold the DS in a book-like fashion.",
