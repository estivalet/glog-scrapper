  "description": "<i>Asterix at the Olympic Games</i>  is licensed from the comic and live action film of the same name. In this sports game the player controls Asterix, Obelix or Dogmatix (Idéfix in most countries) from the French comic series <i>Astérix le Gaulois</i>.<br><br>Unlike the version for Windows, Wii, Playstation 2 and Xbox 360, which is a full fledged 3D action adventure game combined with minigames, the Nintendo DS version focuses completely on the minigames. The plot, combat sequences and puzzle solving have been removed from the game.<br><br>The game does comes with 120 different Olympic challenges. The challenges are divided in 4 categories: Roman, Greek, Gallic and Egyptian. Each challenged is played by rubbing the stylus over the touchpad in a certain way or in a few cases blowing into the microphone. Challenges range from actual Olympic sports like disc throwing to children's games like hula hoops. Players need to obtain at least a bronze medal to continue to the next challenge.",
