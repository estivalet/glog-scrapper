  "description": "<i>Puzzle Quest 2</i> is the third in the <i>Puzzle Quest</i> franchise, and the &quot;2&quot; in the title shows a return to the more fantasy-themed roots of the original game, rather than the science-fiction epic of <i>Galactrix</i>.  <br><br>Story-wise, <i>Puzzle Quest 2</i> is much like the original title in that players take control of a character, and traverse the game world to stop an evil force.  Unlike the original title, which used a large overworld, <i>Puzzle Quest 2</i> &quot;zooms&quot; in the action to a closer view and has the player meandering through smaller areas.  The majority of the game then takes place in caves and underground rooms beneath a troubled town.  Players choose from four character classes--Barbarian, Sorcerer, Assassin, Templar--and whether they want their character to be male or female.  <br><br>\n<b>Gameplay</b><br><br>As with the previous titles, the game is controlled by playing a <i>Bejeweled</i>-style puzzle game in order to progress through the various challenges in the game.  The icons represent four styles of magic, defense, or attacks during battle sequences.  Players solve elements of the puzzle by lining up the icons to build Mana to use magic attacks, to build defense, or to ready physical attacks.  <br><br>Mini-games include puzzle elements to search rooms for hidden items, dig up loot in treasure chests, or unlock doors.  <br><br>The game also features a 2-player head-to-head mode.",
