  "description": "<i>Miami Law</i> is a graphical text adventure where player gets to control brains and brawls through the two leading protagonists. Miami PD officer, Martin Law, a regular hotshot and a loose cannon, is on a vindictive mission to avenge his partner's death. On the other side, FBI agent Sara Sterling is composed by-the-book special agent with a knack for forensics. Put together in this unlikely partnership, they will hunt dangerous criminals, solve cases, and try to reduce the crime by any means necessary.<br><br>While game offers choices that change its course, there is only one right choice, and all others lead to game over. The game focuses on dialogues and investigation (which is done through textual selection rather than using stylus for pixel-hunting) and various mini-games that come in-between. Mini-games vary depending on character you choose. For Martin Law, those will mostly focus on shootouts and car chases, while Sara Sterling will focus on puzzle-solving tasks.",
