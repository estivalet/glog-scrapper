  "description": "<i>Agatha Christie: The ABC Murders</i> is based on the famous same-titled book. The player assumes the role of Captain Hastings and assists Hercule Poirot in his search for a serial killer. The killer finds his victims following an alphabetical pattern, the first victim is a woman named Ascher from Andover, the second victim comes from Bexhill and so on. The 'Classic Story' mode follows the original story from the novel, whereas the 'Free Story' mode has the same victims, suspects and witnesses but their testimonies and motives are different - as well as the identity of the killer.<br><br>To stop the murderer in his tracks, players travel from location to location to inspect crime scenes, interrogate suspects and question witnesses. Before travelling and while talking to people, math and logic problems must be solved. Some of these are directly related to the story, for instance calculating which train is the fastest or which suspect could have been in the vicinity when the murder took place. Answers are given by writing them down on the Touchscreen. Scattered across the locations, small icons are hidden that when touched will give you some trivia about Agatha Christie and her work, as well as clues to the final puzzle, &quot;Poirot's Lost Puzzle&quot;.",
