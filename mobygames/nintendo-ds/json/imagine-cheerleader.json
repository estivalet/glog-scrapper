  "description": "With the school's sports teams losing game after game, and no crowd support, the player, along with her best friend Sam, must do something about it!  Together, the two start a cheerleading squad to help motivate crowds and cheer the teams to victory!  In this rhythm-based memory/mimic game, the player goes head to head against rival cheerleading squads and test reaction times in increasingly difficult routines.  As the team improves and gains fame, the player gets to grow the team and increase its membership to perform increasingly complex maneuvers required to match up with the cheerleading opponents!  Throughout the adventure, the player can customize characters, outfits, hairstyles, and cheer styles, unlocking more options for each category through progress and currencies earned at the end of each cheerleading match.  It is also possible to challenge other cheerleading squads to practice skills and prepare for the next big game!",
