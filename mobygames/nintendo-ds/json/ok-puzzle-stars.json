  "description": "Inspired by the British celebrity magazine franchise 'OK!', 'OK! Puzzle Stars' puts the player as the role of an Editor in Chief, who must solve a variety of puzzles in order to send 12 OK! magazines to the shops.<br><br>The game mainly utilises the Nintendo DS stylus for gameplay and includes puzzles like Wordsearches, Crosswords, Sudoku, Fitword and so on. The player is required to hold the Nintendo DS console sideways in order to play the game. The Start button is also used to pause a puzzle at any time and brings up the Pause Menu (which includes options to continue the puzzle, teach handwriting recognition to suit the player's handwriting mode, or to quit the puzzle).<br><br>Every issue in the game includes 16 puzzles to solve and for every 4 solved, the player must then solve a special puzzle called a 'Puzzle Star' (which rewards the player a cover item for the current issue). When all 4 cover item elements are achieved for one issue, the player moves onto the next until all 12 are complete.<br><br>For every puzzle complete, the player is awarded an OK! Scratch Card. Here players must use the Nintendo DS stylus to rub one out of 3 stars shown to win a certain number of Stars (which allow players to purchase hints in a difficult situation).<br><br>The game includes a variety of famous celebrity photographs throughout Bonus Puzzles (as well as the issue covers) and displays fascinating celebrity facts during the saving processes.<br><br><br><br>",
