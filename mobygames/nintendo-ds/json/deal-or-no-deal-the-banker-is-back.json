  "description": "<i>Deal or No Deal: The Banker is Back</i> is the second Nintendo DS game based on the UK version of the game show Deal or No Deal. The main difference from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/deal-or-no-deal-the-official-nintendo-ds-game\">the first game</a> is that it replaces the original 2D sprites with 3D models. Like in the TV show, the player has to choose one of 22 boxes, each which contains a cash value between 1p and £250,000. The player then starts opening boxes to reveal the content of each. Between rounds, the player is given an offer from a banker and can choose either to keep playing or to take the money from the banker.<br><br>The game contains three single-player modes. There is the classic mode which plays like the TV show, the banker mode where the player gives offers to an AI-controlled contestant and the banker's bonus mode which is like the classic mode but where the player can challenge the banker. This is done by playing a game of Mastermind after rejecting the banker's offer. Another challenge involves rating the banker's offer by choosing from a list of words (ridiculous, greedy, fair, generous or terrific). If the player completes a challenge his respect level increases and as a result will get better offers from the banker.",
