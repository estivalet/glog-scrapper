  "description": "<i> Ni no Kuni: Shikkoku no Mad?shi</i> presents an alternate version of the PlayStation 3 RPG <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch\">Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</a>. It follows a similar story, set in an open world. The turn-based battles allow the player to control the primary character, Oliver; one of his human allies; or his familiars, known as imajinn. The unique magic system is based around a 376-page magic book bundled with the game; in addition to teaching the player about the game's story and items, it contains a compendium of magic spells which can be cast by drawing shapes on the DS's touchscreen.",
