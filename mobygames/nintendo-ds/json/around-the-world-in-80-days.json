  "description": "<i>Around the World in 80 Days</i> is a tile-matching game based upon the novel by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,61309/\">Jules Verne</a> of the same name. The player has to travel around the world in 81 stages and in most of the stages the player has to collect the pieces of a broken artifact. The pieces are collected by removing all tiles below them so that the pieces can &quot;fall&quot; out of the screen. Bonus points and additional time are collected in the same way. At the end of each country, the player has to clear all tiles of the stamp, to prove that this country was visited. The story is told in dialogues between the stages.",
