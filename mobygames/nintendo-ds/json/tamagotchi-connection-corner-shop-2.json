  "description": "  Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop 2's story begins with an option for a name which always ends with the suffix &quot;-tchi.&quot; Then, you get to choose from three different Tamagotchi pets, Memetchi, Mametchi, and Kuchipatchi. Then, it is revealed that you won 10,000 dollars from the lottery, and are going to make a shopping complex with the money, which is called gotchi. There are twelve shops to open, but only four are available at the start. Each game uses the touch screen and the microphone, no buttons required. You must try to make all your shops royal. This means that you have to help a certain amount of people in each shop until Princess Tamako pays a visit. Each customer has a membership card, and gives a review on each visit, which is stamped on the card. Princess Tamako will make your shops bigger and more royal each time she visits.<br><br> \n The four shops that are available at the start are Cake Shop, Burger Shop, Flower Shop and Gas Station. As you boost those shops ,six more will become available,  Flight, Concert Hall, Clinic, Boutique, Bowling, and Sushi Bar. There are two more shops to unlock, Sushi-Bowl and Music Clinic. To unlock the Sushi-Bowl, you must fully upgrade the Sushi Bar and the Bowling. To unlock the Music Clinic, you must fully upgrade the Clinic and Concert Hall. You can also feed your Tamagotchi, give them items for their home, and dress them in Care Mode. There are 104 Tamagotchis that you can serve in the game. You can also trade presents and give demos to other people.",
