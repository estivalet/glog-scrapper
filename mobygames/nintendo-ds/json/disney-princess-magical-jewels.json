  "description": "<i>Disney Princess: Magical Jewels</i> allows players to follow Spryte, the brave and loyal guardian of the Golden Castle in the Enchanted Kingdom of Kindness. Her goal is to gather the magical jewel fragments from the worlds of Cinderella, Belle, Snow White, and Aurora and restore the magical power of the kingdom before the evil ice queen can steal them for herself. <br><br>This side-scrolling adventure game allows the player to control Spryte to fly to any part of the level looking for jewel shards.  When she touches them, she knocks them to the ground where the princess can reach them.  In order to collect them, Spryte must return to the princess and guide her to where the fallen shards are. Mixed within the shards, are the fragments of the Magical Jewels that Spryte is looking for; when she collects two halves, a gem is complete - however the evil Ice Queen will come to try and steal them away. Spryte must engage in a vertical-scrolling dodge-and-collect game, dodging spells from the Ice queen that will momentarily stun Spryte, while collecting shards.  The more shards Spryte collects, the weaker the queen becomes until the player wins.<br><br>In order for Spryte to be able to navigate the princess to where she needs to go, the player must draw bridges and stairs for the princess to walk on; tap elevators to bring her up and down, walk through doors, and fly on sparkle rides to fly from one platform to another.  Other items in the game include rockets that - when activated by sprite (by tapping) - fly into the air and leave a trail of shards behind that can be collected. There are also world-specific items that can be collected by the user for bonus material such as dresses. Minions of varying sizes will scare the princess; Spryte must turn into harmless items such as flowers, butterflies, etc. in order to allow the princess to proceed.<br><br>As the game progresses, and Spryte gathers more jewels from the various worlds, the Golden Castle slowly becomes reconstructed, until the user collects all of the jewels.<br><br>Mini-games also exist to allow the player to play as Ariel in a bubble-stacking race with Sebastian, or help Jasmine fly through the Cave of Wonders to collect magic lamps.  Spryte's battle game against the Ice Queen is also available for play as a minigame.<br><br>In Ariel's mini-game, the player plays against Sebastian releasing bubbles from clams from the bottom screen, to the top screen, where they stack from the top down. During the game, various fish will swim across the screen and pop any bubbles they come in contact with, slowing player progress.  When one player's bubbles reach past the finish line, that player wins. <br><br>In Jasmine's mini game, its a race against the clock  to collect all the magic lamps in the Cave of Wonders.  A player controls Jasmine and flies around a large open area, searching for the lanterns.  When all the lanterns are collected, the game is over and displays the time.<br><br>Multiplayer modes of Ariel's and Jasmine's mini-games exist for play over adhoc wifi. In Ariel's version of the game, the players are playing head-to-head instead of against a CPU opponent; in Jasmine's game, its a race to see who can collect the most lanterns.",
