  "description": "<i>Women's Murder Club: Games of Passion</i> is based on the best-selling novel series by James Patterson. It features hidden object gameplay combined with adventure game elements and mini-games. The Nintendo DS is held like a book during most of the game, while during a mahjong mini-game it is held the normal way.<br><br>A string of seemingly unrelated deaths takes place in San Francisco. Some look like suicide or robbery, but something doesn't add up. Players become part of the Women's Murder Club as they play Lindsay, Cindy or Claire using their respective skills for the task needed. Lindsay, the police officer, investigates the murder scene, first removing any 'clutter' and then looking for clues as listed, for instance objects that may have belonged to the victim or possible murder weapons. Claire, the coroner, finds out the cause of death and anything else that can be deduced from the body. There are no penalties for choosing the wrong object and there is no time limit.<br><br>If played on the DSi, an extra option is available from the main menu: Photo Mysteries. This allows you to play some additional mystery stories with the photo's you have made of family members, household items or pets. ",
