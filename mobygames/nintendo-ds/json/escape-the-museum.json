  "description": "<i>Escape The Museum</i> is a hidden object game with some elements of the adventure genre. Besides the usual gameplay mechanic of finding objects from a list by clicking on them, the game has adventure portions where the player must collect and use objects to escape from a room. These sections follow the simplified puzzle patterns of the recent <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/azada\">Azada</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dream-chronicles\">Dream Chronicles</a> games.<br><br>After each chapter, the player has to search the previous adventure levels for 10 instances of a certain object. 12 precious artifacts have to be collected throughout the game. The game keeps a score based on accuracy, time, object value and the use of hints.<br><br>There are some mini-games: paintings work like jigsaw puzzles that have to be reassembled, and scales have to be stabilized by shifting weights until they reach equilibrium.",
