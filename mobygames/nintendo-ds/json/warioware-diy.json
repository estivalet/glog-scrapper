  "description": "Dr. Crygor, the mad scientist, has done it again!  This time he's created the all-purpose machine, the MakerMatic 21.  Games, music, comics - the MakerMatic 21 can do it all!  Wario soon finds out about the latest invention, and immediately thinks that it'll lead him to big, big bucks!<br><br><i>WarioWare D.I.Y.</i> is a game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496732370\">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</a>.  As with that game, players play through sets of short microgames where they must work out what to do before the time limit is up.  However, unlike the original <i>WarioWare</i>, in this game, you're able to construct your own microgames from start to finish.  By adding graphics, music and scripting, you'll have your own game ready to ship!<br><br>The game features comprehensive tutorials on how to script, create graphics and compose music using the game's user-friendly interface.  However, if you're not good at drawing or composing (or just don't want to), you're able to import graphics and music from any of the 70+ preloaded games.  You can also examine them to see how the scripting works for use in your own games.<br><br>A major feature of <i>WarioWare D.I.Y.</i> is the social aspect of sending and receiving games.  The game encourages game sharing, both locally and through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with the use of friend codes.  Up to two games, records and comics can be stored in each user's Warehouse for download by other users.",
