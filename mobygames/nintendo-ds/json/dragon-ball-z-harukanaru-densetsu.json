  "description": "Popular characters from the DBZ world find themselves in combat again but this time with cards as the weapon of choice. <i>Dragon Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu</i> follows the same action and storyline of the series but battle is handled through card-based combat that adds a new level of strategy never before seen in a DBZ game. Using eight different types of cards, players can fight their way through a story mode which focuses on either Gohan, Piccolo, Goku and an secret forth character. Harukanaru Densetsu also has a multiplayer mode that can be played by up to four participants (each with a copy of the game) or by two with a single cart. ",
