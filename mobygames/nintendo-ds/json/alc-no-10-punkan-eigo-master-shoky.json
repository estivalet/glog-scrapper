Each level of difficulty is released as a standalone game (all of which were release simultaneously) for Nintendo DS that teaches you English grammar, new words, pronunciation, and writing using your stylus. The game itself is based on a PowerWords English teaching software. Mini-games included that try to teach you English consist of English-Japanese and Japanese-English translation quiz, building up grammatically correct sentences and writing the missing characters to complete the right word in the sentence. The tests are done in real-time, giving you limited amount of time to solve them.",
