  "description": "<i>Rooms: The Main Building</i> is the commercial version of an earlier 2006 Korean freeware title. It is a sliding-tiles puzzle game with adventure elements, where the objective is to help an animated character escape by connecting the rooms and creating a pathway to the exit gate.<br><br>The player can only move a room/tile when the character is inside it. This character can move from room to room, if there's no barrier between them. Like in most games, the levels get more complex as the player progresses through it. The first levels have only a few rooms, but as the game progresses, new elements are introduced: locked doors, walls that need to be destroyed with explosives, ladders, teleporters, flooded rooms that kill the character and spinning rooms. The sliding-tile levels take place in four mansions, presented as jigsaw maps.<br><br>The mansions have chests that contain inventory items. Those objects are used in the separate adventure portion, where inventory puzzles have to be solved to win the four gold puzzle pieces necessary to finish the game.<br><br>The latest version of the game has the option of turning off the time limit.",
