  "description": "One day, your sister plunges into a deep sleep and will not wake up.  A monster in the forest tells you that the only thing that will be able to cure her ailment is a scale of the legendary River King, a gigantic fish that has rarely been seen.  Can you find the River King and save your sister?<br><br><i>River King: Mystic Valley</i> is a game based around the sport of fishing.  Players search various rivers and ponds for fish, bait their rods with either bait or a lure, and then patiently wait for fish to bite.  By using the stylus, players cast their line, hook their fish, and even reel it in by using the touch screen to wind the reel and pull the rod.  There are a large variety of baits, rods and lures which can be purchased, and each one is best for catching a particular type of fish.<br><br>As you explore in your adventure, you'll meet monsters which can become your pets.  These monsters, after they are fed fish, transform and earn special powers, such as the ability to heal your stamina, or the ability to smash rocks and let you progress to new paths.  Each of the monsters you find can be levelled up three times, and help you find new areas, fishing spots, and fish.<br><br>The game also features local and online versus multiplayer, allowing players to compete in fishing tournaments against each other.",
