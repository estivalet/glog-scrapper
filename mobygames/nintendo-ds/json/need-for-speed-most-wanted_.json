  "description": "<i>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</i> is a racing game belonging to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Need+for+Speed+series\">Need for Speed series</a>. In the Career mode, you have to beat the 15 blacklisters in order to become the Most Wanted. For unlocking the bosses' circuits, you have to win points by winning races, avoiding police or beating time.<br><br>Unlike the console versions, you can't search events in the city and contrary to the PSP version, you can choose the events you want to play first. If you're slowed down by the police, a mini-game with the stylus takes place, in which you can avoid losing time.<br><br>You can also use the earned money for buying new cars, new improvements in order to be competitive or new tuning stuff.",
