  "description": "Take on the role of a doctor on this unique title for the Nintendo DS.  You play as Dr. Derek Stiles, a young doctor who has just started at Hope Hospital.  Things start off rather normally for the doctor, but he soon discovers that he has a special talent called the 'healing touch'.  This talent allows him to slow down time to perform surgical procedures much faster than normal.  However, a new epidemic begins to appear, and Dr. Stiles will need to be lightning-fast as well as accurate to save his patients' lives!<br><br>Trauma Center is almost entirely played with the stylus.  All of Dr. Stiles' tools are used with the stylus, whether it be the suture, the scalpel, the drain, or the syringe.  Quick and accurate response to the medical procedures will keep your patients healthy, but you'll also need to be prepared for unexpected events that can turn an almost finished operation on its head.  The game is surprisingly difficult, and seems to hail back to challenge of the Super NES era.",
