  "description": "'Puzzler World 2011' is the sequel to 'Puzzler World' released the year before for the Nintendo DS and PC consoles. Based on the critically-acclaimed puzzling magazines by Puzzler Media, the game includes over 1,200 puzzles for every player to solve.<br><br>New games such as 'Hide &amp; Seek' (where players must find a certain shape within a picture), 'Backwords' (where players must black out certain letters within a grid) and 'Pieceword' (where players must drag pieces around the Touch Screen to make a crossword, like a jigsaw) are introduced in this game, as well as the Master Mode filled with 9 categories of puzzles only for the master Puzzler players! These Master Mode puzzles are only unlocked as the player progress through the main Challenge mode.<br><br>New gameplay elements include the Prize Wheel (which awards players with Hint Tokens and Puzzler letters, replacing the three presents from the previous game), the ability to drag words in 'Fitword' to their correct places and several new bonus games including 'Perfect Pairs', 'Colour-In', 'Splitwords' and much more.<br><br>The game also introduces a separate Trophies section, in which players can win trophies by filling certain conditions (e.g. completing all Crossword puzzles, collecting your first Hint Token and even finding a certain number of wordsearch words).<br><br>Just like 'Puzzler World', the game includes 3 save files, the Handwriting Teach mode (which allows players to adjust certain letters to suit their handwriting) and now even the ability to save your puzzle's progress for you to play at a later stage.",
