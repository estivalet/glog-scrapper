  "description": "<i>Supersonic Warriors 2</i> is the DS sequel to the GBA fighting game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dragon-ball-z-supersonic-warriors\">Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors</a>, based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,62994/\">Akira Toriyama's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Dragon+Ball\">Dragon Ball</a> series.<br><br>The game features one-on-one battles between over 30 characters with their own movement and combos. There is a main path in the story mode that coincides with Toriyama's story for every character and some other paths played out as &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios, adding replayability to the game. Next to the story mode, there is the Z battle, the VS battle, Maximum, Free battle and Practice mode. The game has three difficulty levels. In team battles the player can tap the touchscreen to select another fighter. Touch can also be used to perform a powerful combined attack when it is available.<br><br>The sequel moves away from the level system of the first game, where reaching a new character level led to upgraded statistics, or new sprites and attacks. This is replaced by individual characters that become available when a sufficient amount of Dragon Points is available.",
