  "description": "<i>Flower Sun and Rain: Murder and Mystery in Paradise</i> is an adventure game from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Goichi+Suda\">Goichi Suda</a> (or Suda51), who is best known as the lead designer of cult video games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=013388200139\">Killer 7</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=008888173984\">No More Heroes</a>.<br><br>In the game you play as Sumio Mondo, a &quot;searcher&quot; whose job is to search for people's missing items. After failing to defuse a bomb set on an aeroplane, Sumio begins to relive the same day over and over again, and the same disaster continuously takes place.<br><br>The game is played by exploring 3D environments and searching for places, people and objects to examine.  Once Sumio discovers a place he can examine, he uses his partner, &quot;Catherine&quot; — a briefcase that can jack into anything and discover secrets.  After finding the correct jack to hook up to the object with, Sumio must input a code to unlock the secret and solve the puzzle.  Sometimes this is guesswork, sometimes hints are given from other parts of the game.",
