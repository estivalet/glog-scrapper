  "description": "<i>Bomberman Land Touch!</i> is the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo DS (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/bomberman_\">Bomberman</a> being the first game) and it changes the usual gameplay of Bomberman for a mix of adventure and mini-games.<br><br>In the story mode, all the bombermen travel to Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, invited by Giant Gold (yellow bomberman), whose father is rich and has rented the park for a day. The goal of Giant Gold is to conquer the island with the help of the rest of the bombermen, all of which are named after their colors: Cheerful White (the player), Giant Gold, Cool Black, Kid Blue, Pretty Pink (the only girl) and Bookworm Green. <br><br>Once the game starts, we control Cheerful White and we can explore the whole island, which consists in 5 different areas: Spades (the starting point), Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs area, where pieces of the same name can be collected, and the castle. This pieces are collected mostly by winning at mini-games, which are usually based on bombs and serve as the attractions of the park, and are used to open new areas of the map. There is also plenty of characters that give you useful information or send you to solve some quest. The rest of the bombermen will also give you info and quests, and sometimes they will wait you at some of the attractions that you finished and challenge you to it.<br><br>In addition to this game mode, there is the Attraction mode and Battle mode, both multiplayer. In the first one, all the attractions already won can be replayed. In the Battle mode, which is played only with buttons (unlike in the other two modes), the multiplayer mode of the previous Bomberman is recovered. The only difference between both battle modes (as modes, levels, option etc. are exactly the same) is that each of the contenders have to have their own cartridge of the game in the Land Touch version.",
