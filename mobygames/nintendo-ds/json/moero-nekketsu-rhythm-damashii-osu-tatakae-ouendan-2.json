  "description": "Ouendan returns with nineteen more J-Pop/Rock songs, along with nineteen more situations where only a cheer squad can save the day. The original Ouendan and joined by a new team, the Morning City Ouendan, who wear blue in contrast to the black of the Evening City Ouendan.<br><br>Gameplay is largely identical to the original, tapping, sliding and spinning to match the beat of the song playing, in order to progress through different stages of a song. The closer the player gets to matching the song, the more points will be earned and the better the rank achieved. The whole game is played using the stylus. <br><br>Improvements made in 2006's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/elite-beat-agents\">Elite Beat Agents</a> (the non Japanese &quot;remake&quot; of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/osu-tatakae-ouendan\">Ouendan</a>) have been carried over, such as the ability to completely skip introductions and unlockable songs. One replay can be saved on each song, improving the system from Elite Beat Agents.",
