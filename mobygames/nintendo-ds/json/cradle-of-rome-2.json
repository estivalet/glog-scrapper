  "description": "<i>Cradle of Rome 2</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cradle-of-rome\">Cradle of Rome</a>. Just like its predecessor it is a puzzle game played on a board filled with different items. The objective is to remove all items on blue tiles on the board. This is done by creating a match of three tiles or more with an identical item, horizontally or vertically. Matches with default tiles fill up the board immediately again as everything drops down. To get rid of the blue ones, they must be put into a match. The level is won when all blue tiles are removed before the time runs out.<br><br>The main Adventure mode consists of 100 levels through 5 epochs with increasing difficulty and new tiles appearing further in game. During the game the player earns resources that can be used in-between levels to turn a small village into an empire. Blueprints for new buildings are earned through a matching pairs mini-game. The game's visuals consist of hand painted graphics. There are also two unlockable modes (Blitz and Tourney) and 15 extra levels after the main mode has been finished with all rewards.<br><br>For the free browser version the Blitz and Tourney modes are not available.",
