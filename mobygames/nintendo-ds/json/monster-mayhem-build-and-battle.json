  "description": "<i>Monster Mayhem: Build and Battle</i> is a trainer game where the player creates and customises a monster using a variety of components and colors. Once built the player navigates their monster through a city from a bird's-eye view seeking ingredients to create tonics and consuming the Gruffins; small rabbit-like creatures that boost the character's statistics when eaten. <br><br>The main exploration area has several battle arenas placed around the edge of the map where enemy monsters will spawn intermittently. Entering these battle arenas while a monster is present changes the perspective to a one-on-one fighting game shown from a side view. Battles are resolved via a rock, paper, scissors combat system with the addition of tonics to perform special attacks. The Wii version of the game supports motion controls to increase the power of the attacks.",
