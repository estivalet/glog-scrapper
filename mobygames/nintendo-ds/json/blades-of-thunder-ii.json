  "description": "In the near future, an unknown military force has appeared in South America. This force starts getting ready for a large scale military opinion. A pre-emptive attack on the terrorist threat goes terribly wrong; your wingman gets shot down and you find out that the World Anti-Terrorist Coalition's head quarters is destroyed, it's up to you alone to take out the &quot;Solar Martyrs&quot;, the terrorist force behind the attacks.<br><br><i>Blades of Thunder II</i> is a helicopter flight action game where you control a selection of helicopters from either a third person or a first person perspective through several campaigns. While you complete increasingly harder missions, each with a wider selection of enemy units than the previous level, you can find upgrades to your three main weapons as well as your helicopter. You can also unlock new helicopters as you progress in the main campaign.<br><br>The game features a wireless multiplay dogfight mode for up to four players as well as a free flight mode, where you can fly in one of the levels with a set time limit. You have a selection of three levels, three helicopters and a time limit of either three, five or ten minutes in both of these modes. In addition, you can set a frag limit of five, ten or twenty in the multiplay mode.",
