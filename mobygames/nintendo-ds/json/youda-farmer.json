Set up your fields and provide fresh products for all the businesses in the village. In addition to  crops, tomatoes, potatoes, and grapes you'll be taking care of livestock and catching fresh fish. The ingenious principle of the game will keep you on your toes - you'll need to hurry, so the products will reach the stores while they're still fresh. But your efforts will be rewarded  with helpful upgrades and excellent bonus levels.\n<ul>\n<li>80 challenging levels - exclusive to the Nintendo DS version</li>\n<li>several upgrades for the farm and vehicles</li>\n<li>game view switches from day to night automatically</li>\n</ul>",
