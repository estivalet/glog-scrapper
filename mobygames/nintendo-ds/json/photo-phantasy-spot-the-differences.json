  "shortName": "photo-phantasy-spot-the-differences",
  "description": "A spot-the-image game, using the DS's twin screens. Hold the DS on it's side, and the left and right sides display a slightly different image. Use the stylus to note the differences. There are two sets of powerups: hourglasses, which completely refresh your time needed for the level, and magnifying glasses, which automatically find one difference for you. Each story begins with a certain number of these powerups, with no way to replenish them.<br><br>There are three difficulty levels, which have five, six, or seven differences to find in each image, and three stories: Dreams, Goldilocks, and Robin Hood. Multiplayer is also included, where you can either help another player find the differences, or compete to find the differences faster.",
