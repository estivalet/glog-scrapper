The graphics have been greatly improved and the battle sequences are stylized differently, to bring the series on the same level as the modern <i>Super Robot Wars/Taisen</i> titles.<br><br>While the differences between the DS and PSP versions are small, the PSP version also includes voice-overs for all of the characters, along with widescreen graphics.",
