Puzzle, Arcade, Story modes. Dig up rich \n      treasures!\n    </p><br><br><p style=\"margin-top: 0\">\n      Few are aware, and mainstream science seems to ignore the fact, that \n      some almost perfectly spherical metal spheres were found buried deep in \n      various mines in Africa. The spheres have three concentric rings etched \n      around their circumference, which appear to be neither natural nor \n      man-made. So what are these anachronisms doing in rock strata dating \n      back over a million years? Is it possible that the first civilizations \n      could be millions of years old?\n    </p>",
