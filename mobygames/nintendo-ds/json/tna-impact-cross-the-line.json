  "description": "Built from the ground up there are some noticeable changes to this version of TNA iMPACT! when compared to the console versions released a few years ago.<br><br>The roster size has fallen to 18 and is now missing some key wrestlers like Kevin Nash &amp; Team 3D. However there are some new faces also here this time around such as Hulk Hogan and Mick Foley. Wrestlers also have a more updated appearance along with their proper signature moves and finishers in this outing.<br><br>Aside from some gameplay changes there are also three game modes to participate in, Exhibition, Bound for Glory, and Victory Road. Exhibition is a single match mode where you participate in a match of your choosing, a straight up one on one match, a tag team match, Ultimate X, a free for all match with four wrestlers or a steel cage match. Bound for Glory is the main centrepiece of the game and has you participate in the game's story mode that will differ depending on your selected wrestler. Finally there is Victory Road which is a tournament mode that allows you to compete for the World Heavyweight Title, Ultimate X Title, or Tag Team Titles.<br><br>The game also features a bookkeeping feature under Achievements that keeps track of what belts a wrestler has won as well as their wins and losses.",
