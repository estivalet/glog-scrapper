  "description": "<i>Jake Hunter Detective Story: Memories of the Past</i> is not simply a remake of\n<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jake-hunter-detective-chronicles\">Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles</a>. The three cases in that game have been re-localized. Three new cases have been added, one of which was made exclusively for Nintendo DS. <br><br>There is also a new mode in <i>Jake Hunter Detective Story: Memories of the Past</i> called Jake Hunter Unleashed. These are comedic stories done in a completely different style. Finally, more passwords can be found to unlock short stories and interviews with the developers.",
