This time, the player takes on the role of Philip Marlowe, private investigator. While on a case, a big guy called Moose Malloy enter the bar looking for his old flame, Velma Valento. Marlowe steps in to calm down the big guy and hears his story. Seems he's been in prison for 8 years and Velma wasn't interested in waiting. Marlowe reluctantly offers his help if Moose promises to calm down and not do anything rash in the meantime. Expecting a quick conclusion, the great P.I. finds himself entangled in Velma's drama filled with intrigues and deceptions.",
