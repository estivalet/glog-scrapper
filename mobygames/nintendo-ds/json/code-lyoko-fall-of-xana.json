  "description": "<i>Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A.</i> is the third videogame based on the French animated cartoon <i>Code Lyoko</i>, where a group of friends can virtualize in a digital world and fight a super computer trying to take over the world. The game is the sequel to the first game, the DS title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/code-lyoko\">Code Lyoko</a>. It follows the storyline of the season 4, where Aelita is living in our world. X.A.N.A. managed to control William, the new warrior, to make him destroy Lyoko. By chance, Jeremy could make a replica of it. Our friends are now fighting William and are trying to stop X.A.N.A. from taking over the world.<br><br>The game is divided in two parts: a part in 2D, where the player controls the characters at their school where they are confronted with classmates like the annoying Sissi, or with teachers and educators, like Jim. That part of the gameplay is used to gather the latest news about what is going on. Before going into Lyoko, there is a stop at the factory for a briefing by Jeremy, choosing the character and the virtualization point.<br><br>Once in Lyoko, the characters are transported to a 3D environment where they have to fight X.A.N.A.'s creatures. By accumulating data packs and Lyoko Points, the characters can be upgraded with health-enhancing objects, digital powers or access to execute special moves. The fighting system is similar to turn-based games: the player has to choose an action and the enemy to target. If everyone is back to our world, the game is over and the quest has to be restarted from the last checkpoint.<br><br>The game also provides multiplayer with three modes: Classic (Team Deathmatch), Bet (bet with different objects and the winning team takes it all) and Challenge (the player who created the round can choose a challenge like playing with digital power).",
