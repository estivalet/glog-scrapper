  "description": "Wario is thinking of new ways to get rich. A TV-show about a thief inspires him to drop in on the show and steal the thief's magic wand, which allows him to disguise himself. Each disguise has special advantages that help Wario through the levels. Changing disguises is done by drawing a symbol on the touch-screen, for example drawing a semi-circle around Wario's head (a &quot;helmet&quot;) changes him into Cosmic Wario and gives him the power to blast laser beams. Drawing a canvas grants Artsy Wario the power to draw blocks that can be used to reach ledges. <br><br>Each level contains treasure chests. Opening these triggers one of eight different mini-games. Winning a mini-game unlocks new disguises, maps or collectible treasures. There are also plenty of enemies to beat and moneybags to collect. A defeated enemy leaves coloured gems behind, collecting these increases the associated power. Each of the ten episodes of the TV-show ends with a level boss that has to be defeated by using the disguises.",
