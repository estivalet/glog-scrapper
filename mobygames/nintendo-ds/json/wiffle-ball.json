  "description": "Wiffleball is a variation of baseball played in smaller or confined areas, generally played with a plastic ball and a plastic bat on a triangular field. In the game adaptation players can choose a character and locations such as a backyard, a school, a street or a sand lot. Next to single games, the game can also played in a season mode on all locations. Similar to baseball, the game consists of batters, pitchers and fielders. The pitcher's throw is based on speed and stamina meters, while batting is done through the stylus. The game also supports wireless multiplayer games.",
