Alongside the touchscreen controls of it's predecessors, Mobilized brings new features to the table including new weapons and vehicles, new mini-games such as computer hacking and the ability to take control of UAV spy drones and an AC-130 gunship. <br><br>Also returning is multiplayer through Nintendo Wi-Fi, now allowing up to six players. New modes include the console favourite Sabotage and a new Survival mode, likely inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Call+of+Duty%3a+World+at+War\">Call of Duty: World at War's</a> Zombie mode.<br><br>The AI has also been improved, enemies now can take cover,  charge with shotguns, or pull back when the player enters the room.<br><br>Mobilized is a companion piece to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2\">Modern Warfare 2</a> and although it takes place in the same setting, it does not follow the same plot or characters.",
