  "description": "<i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> deals with Black Op missions recounted by Sgt. Shaw to a superior officer. The main campaign consists of sixteen missions set around the Cold War (specifically 1968 with occasional flashback missions to a few years before that). Missions take place in diverse locations such as Cuba, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. While most missions feature typical first person shooter gameplay, players will occasionally be given a chance to fly vehicles like a helicopter or a fighter jet. Each mission besides the aforementioned vehicle missions contains four intel items which can be collected.<br><br>The game also features other modes such as Quick Play (replay any mission from the campaign), Challenge Mode (has specific goals for the player to do on a mission), Arcade Mode (lets the player play the main campaign missions but this time with a set number of lives and a time limit), Zombie mode.(has four maps), a Multiplayer mode (has twelve maps), and the Killhouse mode which lets the player race through a shooting range blasting targets.<br><br>\n",
