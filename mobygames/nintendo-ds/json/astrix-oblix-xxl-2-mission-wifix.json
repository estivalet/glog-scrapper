  "description": "<i>Astérix &amp; Obélix XXL 2: Mission: Wifix</i> is an action game based on the French comic Astérix. It is a redesigned version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/astrix-oblix-xxl-2-mission-las-vegum\">Astérix & Obélix XXL 2: Mission: Las Vegum</a>. The story is the same: Astérix and Obélix have to travel to Caesar's amusement park &quot;Las Vegum&quot; to rescue the captive druids. The two will have to fight their way through Roman soldiers in the various differently themed areas of the park. The player can switch between Astérix and Obélix at any time and use their respective strengths and weaknesses to overcome certain obstacles. The DS version has been redesigned as a side-scrolling game employing 3D graphics. The game includes four mini-games that are played using the DS stylus and can also be accessed from the main menu outside the main game. Two more mini-games are available in wireless multi-player mode.",
