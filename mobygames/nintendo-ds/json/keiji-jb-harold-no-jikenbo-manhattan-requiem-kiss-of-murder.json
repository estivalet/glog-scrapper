  "description": "This game features two stories of J.B. Harold, the private investigator. Two stories are the alternate version of the same case, that starts and develops different from one another, though leaving common characters and places. Sort of like playing J.B. Harold in two alternate realities in which the case was triggered differently.<br><br><b>Gameplay:</b> In this first-person novel adventure game you will get multiple dialogues to select during interrogations and casual chats. The game also features a face reaction function that makes it easier to grasp the state of the mind of a person you are talking to. Back logging function makes it easy to go over through dialogues you might've skipped too fast or would just want to refresh your memory. Game also marks questions you've asked so repeating yourself later is mitigated.<br><br><b><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/manhattan-requiem\">Manhattan Requiem</a></b><br><br><b>Story:</b> The letter reached J.B. informing him of a murder that occurred in the Liberty City. The sender was Sarah Shields. A sudden phone call from a former senior detective Judd, that is now in the insurance business, informs J.B. of another murder case. The person in question is Sarah Shields. Apparently she jumped off her apartment on the 5th floor, somewhere in Manhattan. There were no witnesses and no evidence pointing to a foul play. It seems like a clean case for the police. But J.B. doesn't agree with that. He has questions... what was is that she was holding in her hand on the crime scene, what are the clues the police are missing, and most of all, why would she want to kill herself.<br><br><b><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kiss-of-murder\">Kiss of Murder</a></b><br><br><b>Story:</b> In the west part of Greenwich village a young woman was murdered. The victim's name was Sarah Shields. She was keeping a huge sapphire that was insured, but the sapphire disappeared with her death. Insurance investigator Judd, who was an ex-detective, contacted J.B. at the murder department of the Liberty City police and asked him for help with the case.",
