  "description": "<i>Really? Really! DS</i> is one of the spin-off sequels to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/shuffle_\">Shuffle!</a> adult visual novel, and a non-adult port of the adult game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=Windows\">Really? Really!</a> for PC (Windows) released three years earlier. The story features Rin Tsuchimi (?? ?) as the protagonist and main focus of the story is to try and help Kaede Fuyou (?? ?), who was in a coma which resulted in her memory getting scrambled, regain her memory. The game resembles <i>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</i> series as the player controlling Rin often has to spot incorrect things in the story and select the right keyword that he finds false or suspicious and question it with same posture and determination as Phoenix Wright, except instead of &quot;Objection!&quot; word the player uses &quot;Really?&quot;. Misses and failures are just as punishable and five errors result in game over. The game also features mini-games which can be played at the in-game computer, and microphone interaction during scenario where player has 10-second window to speak the command.",
