  "description": "A young woman is found unconscious by African peasants after her plane crashes following a rebel attack. When she wakes up, she finds herself in the town of Madargane, in the harem of the local prince, with no recollection of previous events. While she believes that her name is Ann Smith, a student attending a university in Geneva, the real truth is that she cannot remember. She also has no idea why she traveled to Africa in the first place. As she tries to regain her memories, she gradually realizes that she will have to play a key role in the future of a fictional African country called Maurania, to which she is more connected than she would ever imagine.<br><br><i>Paradise</i> is a traditional third-person perspective point-and-click adventure, similar in gameplay and visual style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/syberia\">Syberia</a>. The player navigates a 3D character model over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Interaction can only be performed with &quot;hot spots&quot; on the screen, and is done with a simple single-cursor interface. The vast majority of the puzzles are inventory-based. During a certain part of the game, the player can take control of a black leopard.",
