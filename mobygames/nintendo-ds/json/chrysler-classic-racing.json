Chrysler Classic Racing is set in America during the \n      car-crazed era of 1950s and 1960s, and you're on a mission to become the \n      &quot;King of Cool&quot; by redefining not only your own style, but creating the \n      hippest racing vehicle on the road! With just enough dough in your \n      pocket to buy an entry-level Chrysler, take part in &quot;after-hours&quot; races. \n      Win some cash and buy new cars, better engines sweet decals, or faster \n      tires. Or make yourself look cooler with a sleek new haircut, more \n      fashionable threads, and swankier sunglasses. If your car looks hot and \n      your style is slick, you could just become the &quot;King of Cool.&quot;\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Having a cool car, lapping opponents, and winning races by a \n        substantial margin are just some of the ways to be awarded Cool Points.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Use Cool Points to customize your character-improve haircuts, add cool \n        facial hair, buy hot new clothes, or update to stylish shades.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Customize your classic Chrysler vehicles including the Barracuda and \n        the Belveder, change the tires, suspension, and steering, not to \n        mention adding cool paint decals and chrome finishes.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Incorporated mini-games are an essential part of the gameplay and \n        storyline-like bartering for cars and racing for pink slips.\n      </li>\n    </ul>",
