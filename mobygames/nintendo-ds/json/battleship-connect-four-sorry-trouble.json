  "description": "This compilation includes four licensed board game translations on a single cart. Both singleplayer and multiplayer are supported for all games.<br><br><b>Battleship</b><br>\nEach player places five ships horizontally or vertically on a grid. Taking turns, players guess a location on the grid and fire. The first player to sink all five of the opponent's ships wins the game. This version also includes the salvo variant where players can fire five shots per turn. For each ship sunk on a side, that player loses a shot for the salvo, resulting in less shots. Each player can choose an admiral as an avatar before playing.<br><br><b>Connect Four</b><br>\nPlayers take turns to get four of their coloured checkers in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. There are three variations included: Classic, Timed (time limit added per turn) and Fours (remove a checker from the board to create a row of four checkers and play until no more moves are possible).<br><br><b>Sorry!</b><br>\nBe the first player to get all four of your pawns from your colour &quot;Start&quot; to your colour &quot;Home&quot;. For each turn, players draw a card that allows them to move forward or backward. Jump on a space already occupied by an opposing pawn to send it back to its starting location. By going backwards players can choose to move the pawn into a safety zone in the next turn, without going all the way around the board. When a pawn lands on the beginning of a slide zone not the player's colour and by exact count, it slides to the end of the zone and bumps all pawns in the way back to their starting location. Each card drawn has a different meaning related to movement. Two variations are included: Classic and Quick.<br><br><b>Trouble</b><br>\nPlayers need to move their four coloured pegs around the game board into the finish line to win the game. Movement is based on numbers and a 6 is required to get a peg in the field. By landing on a zone occupied by an opponent's peg, it is sent back to the start. Two variations are included: Classic and Quick.",
