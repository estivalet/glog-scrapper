It is a first-person shooter set in World War II. The game has three storylines: American (the takeover of Shuri Castle), British (fighting against German forces) and Russian (Battle of Seelow Heights and Reichstag). In all of these storylines you play different characters. The game also features a big multiplayer option with 11 maps, 6 playable match-types and multiplayer-only weapons. The game has multiple minigames which can be played with the stylus on the bottom screen. On May 20, 2014 Nintendo has decided to disable the online servers and the multiplayer is not playable anymore through Wi-Fi. You can still play multiplayer with linked DS-systems. ",
