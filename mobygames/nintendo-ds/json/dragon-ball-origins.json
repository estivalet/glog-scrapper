  "description": "In <i>Dragon Ball: Origins</i> the player controls Goku who is on a quest to get all seven Dragon Balls, which grant one wish when brought together. Goku is a young boy, but strong as he was raised up in the mountains. He teams up with Bulma, a city girl who joins him because Goku have the 4-star ball.  <br><br>In the game the stylus is mostly used for the gameplay.  Players touch an area to walk or run to it, and touch an enemy to attack it. By touching Goku and drawing a line to an enemy, a dash attack is performed. It is also possible to switch to the power poll, a ranged weapon, to do damage from a distance. Bulma helps Goku with her shotgun, and she will do a more powerful attack when she acts when she has maximum Ki. They both need to work together to bring down opponents.",
