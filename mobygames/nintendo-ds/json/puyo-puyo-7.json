  "description": "It's a rainy day at a typical Japanese classroom - only that it's raining rainbow-colored jellies! Math wiz Ringo Andou is scared to death of this strange situation, until she is schooled in the ways of Puyo by the familiar face of Arle Nadja. When Arle suffers a mysterious headache and disappears, Ringo sets out on a mission to stop the ongoing flood of Puyo. But the plot thickens as Ringo uncovers plot after diabolical plot and realizes the very existence of mankind is at stake.<br><br><i>Puyo Puyo 7</i> is different from other Puyo Puyo games in that the story mode is told in 6 acts of varying numbers of episodes, as Ringo Andou (and the friends she meets along the way) travel to place after place, battling popper after Puyo popper to stop a mysterious force from flooding the world with Puyo. There are 19 players in all, with 5 being new (including Ringo). The gameplay, however, is quite similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puyo+Puyo+15th+Anniversary\">Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary</a> - swamp your opponents in a flood of Nuisance Puyo across 5 (less compared to <i>15th Anniversary</i>) different game play modes and move on to the next area. <br><br>As usual, there is also the battle mode, where up to 4 players (8 on the DS version) compete to see who is the best Puyo popper. As in <i>15th Anniversary</i>, only the Original Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Fever rules are available in 8-player games.",
