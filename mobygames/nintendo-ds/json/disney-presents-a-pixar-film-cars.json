  "description": "<i>Disney Presents a Pixar Film: Cars</i> is a mini game collection based on the animated movie of the same name. The central theme is the Piston Cup, a racing championship, which the protagonist Lightning McQueen wants to win against his rival Chick Hicks. There are twelve mini games and four races in all, which are played over four stages (three mini games and one race each).<br><br>During the races, both Lightning and Chick move with fixed speed and the player only needs to activate the recharging speed boost and change between four lanes in order to avoid slower cars. The success in this task and the pitstop whack-a-mole mini-game decides who wins the race. The other mini games star different characters from the movie and are a mix of various challenges, e.g. a <i>Simon Says</i> variant, stacking tires, sorting trophies or a rhythm game. The two-player mode allows to compete in races.",
