Using seven geometrical shapes known as &quot;tans,&quot; the player tries to fill in the outline of a shape in order to solve the puzzle and reveal the picture that the shape represents. Once a puzzle is solved and the picture is revealed, the image appears on the top screen, slowly completing an illustration. Each of the 10 levels of the game features a distinct theme such as &quot;Zoo&quot; or &quot;Beach,&quot; with each theme containing 10 puzzles.",
