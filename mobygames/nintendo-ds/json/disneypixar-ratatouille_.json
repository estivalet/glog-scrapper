  "description": "'Ratatouille' is a 3D action platformer game based on the 2007 Disney Pixar film of the same name. The story involves Remy the rat who must complete a number of missions in order to make the Chez Gusteau restaurant famous again.<br><br>The Nintendo DS version plays much differently to the other console versions, as players can control Remy around the several levels with either the control pad or the stylus (These settings can be toggled at any time by pressing Select). Remy can also scramble up walls, wall jump, run, sneak past enemies and even use his keen sense of smell to locate objects needed within the level objectives. An exposure meter is also added in which players must help Remy achieve his goals without being seen by humans.<br><br>The DS version also includes a cooking minigame in which players need to help Remy, Linguini and Colette cook several dishes within a given time limit. The console's microphone is only used to blow on any boiling pot to cool it down.<br><br>Single Card Download Play is also available for 4 players to compete against each other at the Cooking Mini-game.",
