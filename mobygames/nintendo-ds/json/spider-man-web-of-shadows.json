  "description": "Symbiotes have taken over New York, the city is in chaos, and only Spider-Man has a chance of stopping this mysterious new alien menace.<br><br>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows gives Spider-Man the powers of both the classic red suit and the newer black suit. As he progresses deeper into the game, players must decide which suit to rely on -- the agility and quickness of the red suit, or the sheer power of the black suit. As Spider-Man defeats enemies, he'll unlock new abilities, web moves, and suit upgrades, including the ability to call in other Marvel characters as allies, such as Nightcrawler and Green Goblin.<br><br>The game's sidescrolling action lets players explore the expansive, symbiote-corrupted New York at their own pace. Abilities unlocked in the game let players explore deeper into the city, allowing Spider-Man to traverse symbiotic sludge and blast through ichor-filled tunnels, as well as defeat the increasingly-dangerous infected denizens.\n",
