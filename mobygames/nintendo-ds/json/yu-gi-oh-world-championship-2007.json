  "description": "<i>Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2007</i> is based on the anime \n<i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> and <i>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</i> but there is no real plot in this game. It is a simulated environment to play the Yu-Gi-Oh! collectible card game. Play vs. the AI in regular, limited, and themed battle, or challenge the various puzzles where you must win in one turn with the cards given to you. In addition to playing against the game AI, you can challenge other players online through the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection. The game allows you to change the appearance of your avatar through various hair, shirt, and VR disc styles. Earn points by winning battles; the points act as currency and allow you to purchase small booster packs increasing the size of your card library.<br><br>Yu-Gi-Oh! is a collectible card game where two players battle by using monster, trap, and spell cards.  The rules have changed over time, but in this game both players start with 8,000 life points.  There are many ways to win, the most common through damage, which brings your opponent's life points to 0.  If you're not able to draw a card you lose. Also, there are certain cards that give you special win conditions. The field is restricted though to only allow 5 trap and/or spell cards and 5 monster cards.  Deck size is a minimum of 40 cards.\n \nEach player takes turns that are broken down into phases (draw, standby, main, battle, main 2, and end phase). The main actions take place during the two main phases and the battle phase. To begin, the players draw 5 cards. Each player draws a card during their own draw phase. Some cards have special effects that occur during the standby phase; otherwise, nothing happens during this phase, although some cards can be activated during this time as well. The main phases allow the current player to make any number of special summons, set any number of trap cards, play or set any number of spell cards and make one tribute, normal, or set summon.<br><br>During the battle phase each player can attack with any of their face up attack position monsters on the field, but this phase is skipped for the player that goes first. The end phase is a clean up phase and a time for any last minute actions. If the current player has more than six cards in hand, then they must discard down to six cards.",
