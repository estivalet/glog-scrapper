  "description": "On the island of Voya Nui, the evil Piraka have stolen the six elemental masks of the Toa. It's up to you to explore the island's temples, retrieve the masks, and defeat the Piraka and their minions.<br><br><i>Bionicle Heroes</i> DS is a classic first-person shooter. As a nameless Matoran, you'll travel across 25 themed levels (including jungles, lava-worlds, ancient underground temples) discovering new weapons and new robotic foes to blast apart. Along the way, you'll use the masks' powers to survive the hostile environments as well as collect gears and robot parts to solve simple puzzles by assembling LEGO-style ramps, bridges, and doorways.<br><br>The levels in the game are populated by a large visual variety of Bionicle-inspired bad guys, including ones that transform, fly, roll, or charge at you with scorpion-like stingers. Fortunately, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons and destroy them with plasma blasts, lightning, and sniper lasers.<br><br>The game also contains a robust local multiplayer mode that allows up to 4-players to compete in deathmatches in arenas laden with weapon and mask upgrades.",
