Once again, each player controls a team of little worms equipped with unorthodox yet powerful weaponry to destroy the opposing teams across fully destructible maps.<br><br>It is possible to play solo in Campaign mode, playing through various missions connected by a storyline with animated sequences, take on various challenges in Puzzle mode, or take on friends and enemies in multiplayer with up to four teams, with support for offline, wireless and new online play, as well as various schemes and new game modes like Forts and Race.<br><br>Players can also keep their teams distinguished by customizing everything from worm names and soundbank to victory dances and the team flag, as well as make custom flags with the flag editor. It is also possible to personalize the battlefield with the new map types - Pirates, WW-I, WW-II, Cold War, Gulf War and Future War - as well as a map editor. There are more weapons and utilities to choose from, such as for example the new Electromagnet, Boomerang, Bunker Buster, Sentry Gun, or just the return of classics like the Holy Hand Grenade, Concrete Donkey, Super Sheep, and so on.<br><br>In addition, the PSP version features an online lobby with ranking and clans, Time Attack mode, zoomable map, downloadable content and hats, while the DS version features a Laboratory mode (mini-games that use the touchscreen / microphone), stylus-based interface and a scrollable mini-map.",
