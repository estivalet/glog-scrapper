  "description": "Ridge Racer DS is a remake of Ridge Racer 64 with some changes and additions.  All the same levels are there, but there are plenty of new cars, including Namco- and Nintendo-themed vehicles.  There is also some new music that was not in the N64 version.<br><br>The Touch Screen on the Nintendo DS is put to use all throughout the game, including navigation through every menu and even a revolutionary new control where the player steers the steering wheel with the stylus or thumb ring.<br><br>Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.  Using wireless communication, up to 6 players can race against each other.  In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the systems.  The other 5 players don't even need the game.  There will be more items, such as cars, available to play with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though.  So there is an advantage to having multiple Game Cards.",
