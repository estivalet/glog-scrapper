  "description": "Alfonso Senior, having made his fortune from the original <i>Pipe Mania</i>, has retired to Paradise Island. Unfortunately, the island has an alarmingly high number of plumbing-related problems. Alfonso's retired, but he's called in his kids Junior and Fawcett to fix up the island, and maybe learn a few things about plumbing along the way.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pipe-dream\">Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania</a>, but with a more mission-based structure, and more unusual modes. Missions can be replayed to get a higher grade, and high grades can unlock various treasures, such as movies, character bios, and new game modes. <i>Pipe Mania</i> even has a multiplayer mode; compete against a friend for points, or use your attacks to damage your opponent's pipes.",
