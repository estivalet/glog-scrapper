  "description": "<i>Shrek the Third</i> for Nintendo DS is the only game based on the movie of the same name that does not follow its plot. This 3D action game makes heavy use of the microphone and touchpad. You can play as Puss in Boots, Prince Artie, and, of course, Shrek. Player controls are almost entirely touch screen based. Each character has his own special ability, so you need to figure out puzzles and switch characters in order to continue. The game features local multiplayer, allowing up to 3 players to play and each control a different character. Multiplayer gameplay is the same as single-player. ",
