  "description": "Taking players back to the ancient Aztec ruins, <i>The Treasures of Montezuma 2</i> is a match 3 tile game with hidden object elements. The game features the same gameplay and types of power-ups as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/treasures-of-montezuma\">first game</a>. However, it doesn't have any type of story and presents everything in a slightly different way.<br><br>Players choose a male or female avatar and must begin the game in Adventure mode where the puzzles are grouped into 5 chapter stages. The objective in each puzzle is to explode tiles and extract all of the embedded gems before time runs out. Groups of three or more identical tiles are created by swapping one from one spot to another. That group explodes causing all gems to be &quot;collected&quot; while new tiles fall in from the top to fill in the spaces.<br><br>The first levels have a three minute limit with more time possible with bonuses. Bonuses are purchased with the collected coins (instead of stars) in the &quot;town&quot; screen.<br><br>Tiles encased in ice are new in this game and must be matched twice before they can be removed. Hidden object mini-games occur between the stages providing additional opportunities to earn money.<br><br>After the first stage is completed, an Endless mode can be played without a time limit, but also without power helpers. Later, a Puzzle mode opens up with 40 logic-based puzzles.",
