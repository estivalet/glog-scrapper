  "description": "Scotland Yard is hunting Mister X. He has been the thief of thieves for a long time stealing precious art and jewellery from the best-guarded places all around the globe. The player has to stop him before he starts out for his next coup. \nYou can decide if you play Mister X or together with your friends as a group of detectives within the multiplayer mode. If you have new information about Mister X's location, you can scribble it on the touch screen so the other detectives can see it and help. Be cautious, because Mister X (whether he's played by a player or by the AI) will try to escape by bus, train or taxi. It will take every team members skills of observation and tactical thinking to get a grip on him in the end. In single player mode you can also play the story campaign in five different cities. \nIn case you are lacking co-players you may just as well play for yourself in a team of in-game detectives or play Mister X against the computer.
