The player starts off by choosing a dog from a large selection of 18 different breeds that come in many colors. The dog can be taken out for walks, entered in competitions, and can even be thrown parties with all the other dogs in the neighborhood that you meet on your daily stroll. Taking good care of the dog does come with its rewards. The player will receive gifts and presents to decorate his or her room, as well as toys and things to buy at the pet store for the new puppy.<br><br>In the DS version the controls are slightly different. With the voice recognition feature, the player can call the dog to come to the avatar, as well as teaching it new tricks and commands. With the touch screen feature, the player can write in a diary about his or her day with the puppy. Lastly, with the networking feature, the player can share puppy mini-games with friends. All this and more. ",
