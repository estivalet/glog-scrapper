In the game the player takes control of Hal Jordan who is part of the intergalactic Green Lantern Corps. Long ago the guardians of the universe created androids that acted as an interstellar police force. These androids were known as the Manhunters. The androids however became corrupted and they began to punish all life in the galaxy. At some point they were exiled but now they have returned to seek revenge.<br><br>Gameplay includes mostly 2D side scrolling action. The player can use the Green lantern ring as several weapons like a gun, sword or hammer to defeat enemies. Some sections of the game are played from a behind view.\n",
