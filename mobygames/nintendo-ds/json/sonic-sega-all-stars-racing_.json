  "description": "<i>Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing</i> on the Nintendo DS is an arcade racing game in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-kart\">Super Mario Kart</a>. It features characters from SEGA's various franchises. The game is for the most part largely identical to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sonic+%26+SEGA+All-Stars+Racing\">home console counterpart</a>, save for some differences: The layouts of some tracks have been altered and the Mission Mode challenges have been completely changed, with a scoring system based on stars as opposed to letter-grades. The game also features a smaller collection of selectable characters.",
