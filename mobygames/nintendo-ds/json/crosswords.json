  "description": "CrossworDS is the correct title for this game and is just short for Crosswords for Nintendo DS. It's a port of the popular and classic crossword puzzle game which you can find for example in newspapers.<br><br>You can use the touchpen to write each alphabetic character manually into a designated field. The character recognition is very reliable. Or if you want it faster, you can use an on-screen typewriter keyboard and just select each letter with the touch pen.<br><br>There are 555 crosswords in 5 different languages (2700 puzzles altogether) to be solved in the game. They are divided into three difficulty settings, easy, medium and hard. <br><br>Six categories can be trained:<br><br>1. culture (art, literature, language)\n2. nature (geography, animals, environment)\n3. sports (disciplines, athletes, venues)\n4. entertainment (music, movie, television)\n5. science (inventions, medicine, technology)\n6. general knowledge.<br><br>There is even a multiplayer option which makes use of the wireless gaming capabilities of the DS. Each Nintendo DS needs an own game cardridge to participate. You can choose between two modes: &quot;Playing together&quot; is an ordinary crosswords session which has to be solved cooperatively without any time limits until all participants have solved all the words together. &quot;Against each other&quot; is the second mode, there is a time limit of 5 minutes. The winner is who has solved most words during that time.",
