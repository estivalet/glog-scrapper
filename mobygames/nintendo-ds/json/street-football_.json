  "description": "A game based on the <i>Street Football</i> cartoon series.<br><br>The game has three modes of play. The main mode is the Adventure mode. The Adventure mode which lets players  take on the role of Tag and let them get to experience the Rifflers story.  Players go around the Riffler Institute completing challenges that help increase their soccer skills. After they are skilled enough, they get to go up against other soccer teams.<br><br>The way soccer is played is this game is different than the way soccer is played in oher videogames.  When the player goes on offense the game is viewed as it would be in a side-scrolling platformer/ Players have to try to get by defenders in order to get to an overhead screen in which they'll be given a chance to get a free kick on the other team's goalie. When on defense, during the side view section, they can try to slide kick the ball away from their opponent, and during the overhead section the player controls a goalie and has to try and block three consecutive free goal shots.<br><br>There is also a Practice mode which lets players replay the challenges from the main game and also the Matches mode which lets players play an exhibition match.",
