  "description": "<i>Monster Rancher</i> is one of the longest running monster-breeding game series of all time, comparable even to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Pok%c3%a9mon+universe\">Pokémon franchise</a>. The formula for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Monster+Rancher+series\">Monster Rancher games</a> has remained largely unchanged over the years -- generate a monster, put him/her/it through a training regimen that emphasizes certain vital statistics, then enter your monster into ranked tournaments to win cash and prizes. The feature that's always made the <i>Monster Rancher</i> series unique is the methods in which you generate your monsters. Previous iterations have used CDs and DVDs, but the DS version allows you to draw a picture or speak into the DS microphone. That information is then (somehow) converted into a monster which you then start training.<br><br>Aside from training, there are also trials you can take your monster through which will teach them new techniques, and a scavenger-hunt style mini game where your monster can find valuable items to use in battle or just to sell for money. In addition, you can connect wirelessly with a friend to battle their monster or even combine monsters to make more powerful breeds.",
