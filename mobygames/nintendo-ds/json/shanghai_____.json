  "description": "<i>Shanghai</i> for the Nintendo DS carries on the long tradition of Activision and Sunsoft's series of mahjongg solitaire games.<br><br>The game comes with several different modes. The standard game played in either Classic or Free Play mode, In these modes, players select from three different difficultly levels that effect how many times a next move will be shown and how many undo moves the player gets.  Classic Mode forces the player to go through the boards sequentially with the boards getting harder while Free Mode lets players choose to play any of the 28 boards with the player's choice of background, music track, and tile set with more options opening up as more of the Classic Mode is beaten.<br><br>\nA Time Attack mode challenges the player to beat the boards as fast as possible while a Score Attack mode lets the player keep playing a board that keeps getting more tiles added after its cleared so the player has an endless opportunity to rack up points. Players have to be careful in Score Attack mode, as they can manually add tiles if they run out of moves, but adding too many tiles can cause the game to end.<br><br>The game also has two game modes that are about tie matching but are uniquely different from the traditional Shanghai. Those two modes are Nikaku Dori and Great Wall. Both of these game types don't have stacked titles instead having all the tiles lay flat and they each have their own unique rules for tile removal.<br><br>The game also features a two-player mode that can be played against either another human or computer opponent. The goal is to win a certain number of matches by being the first player to unlock a golden tile.<br><br><br><br>",
