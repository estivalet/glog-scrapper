  "description": "While this game still features the story from the movie and novel, the gameplay is different from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Chronicles+of+Narnia%3a+Prince+Caspian\">console counterparts</a>.  This version utilizes the DS' dual-screen technology and stylus pen, with a RPG-style battling system, using the pen to pick a character and then picking an enemy, at which point a menu will pop up, letting the player choose their style of attack.  A player's character cannot attack, however, if their stamina bar is low and must wait until it is refilled to attack again.<br><br>Players can regain health by picking up objects like apples and using them through an item menu and even pick up items to trade later in the game to purchase upgrades for their character.  There are also side missions as well, such as finding items to cure and sick Narnian or even complete tasks in order to recruit Narnian's to the players army.<br><br>There is also multiplayer capability using either Wi-Fi or through Disney.com website, where players can share scores, unlock extra content as well as chat with fellow players.",
