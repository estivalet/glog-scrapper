  "description": "<i>Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai III Remix</i> is a handheld version of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/idol-janshi-suchie-pai-iii\">Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai III</a>. You play strip mahjong against young, attractive female opponents. However, it's not a port, as there are many modifications. First, there is no nudity. While your opponents strip, they only strip down to their swimsuits. In the Nintendo DS version, the cutscenes and swimsuit scenes are presented as slideshows, there is no spoken dialogue during cutscenes, instead displaying text, and there are no vocal tracks. There is also a free battle mode, an album mode to view the swimsuit scenes, a sound test to listen to the music tracks, a dress-up with Miyuri minigame, and a mode in which Miyuri talks about the various characters in the game.",
