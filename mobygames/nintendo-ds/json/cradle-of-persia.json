  "description": "<i>Cradle of Persia</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/cradle-of-rome\">Cradle of Rome</a>, taking place during the Persian era instead of Ancient Rome. It is a tile-matching game where the tiles have icons of city resources. Matching three or more of these tiles collects them to their respective resources tab. By combining these resources, the player can erect buildings.<br><br>To finish a level, the player must break the marbled background before time runs out or lose a life. There are also bonuses that can be collected during the game that will help the player, like lightning bolts that destroy a random amount of tiles.",
