  "description": "The DS edition of Bratz: Forever Diamondz (based on the 2006 direct-to-DVD film of the same name) lets players help the Bratz quartet (Cloe, Jade, Sasha and Yasmin) travel across the United States in search of the hottest fashion designer for the 'America Rocks Fashion' TV show competition. The winner of the competition will then receive the grand prize: A pair of go-go boots studded with several diamonds. <br><br>This version makes great use of the system's stylus, as it is mainly required to carry out several minigame tasks such as tracing patterns to strike poses on the catwalk, tracing skate figure shapes and a dogsled event. The console's built-in microphone is also utilised to give voice commands to the player's adopted pet in animal-based pet shows and agility races. DS Wireless Communications (both Single-Card and Multi-Card) also allow DS players to compete in several minigames and trading numerous outfits.<br><br><br><br>",
