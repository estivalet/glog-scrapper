  "description": "Play as Storm - a brave commando and vehicle specialist on a mission to stop Rattlesnake - a ruthless villain bound on world domination.\nThis arcade-style shooter faithfully recreates the unique and robust art style and gameplay of SNK's Metal Slug series. The game features seven sidescrolling stages with multiple areas each and vehicle sections interspersed with on-foot action. Six primary weapons are available throughout the game as limited ammo collectible powerups ranging from beloved classics such as a Heavy Machine Gun to exotic picks like an Electro Gun. Two of these powerups can be collected at once and switched with the L-Trigger. A variety of grenades is also available as the secondary weapon.",
