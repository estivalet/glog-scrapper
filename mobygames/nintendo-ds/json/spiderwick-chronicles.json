  "description": "Play as Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace as they explore the fantastical world around them with the help of a secret field guide, written by Arthur Spiderwick. <br><br>Search for fairies by blowing into beams of light, shaking bushes and overturning rocks with your stylus. Collect them all to complete the field guide. Battle goblins and monsters in engaging turn-based combat by using the fairies you've collected, or items you've picked up along the way. Defeat the evil ogre, Mulgarath, before he takes over the world with the forbidden knowledge held inside the Spiderwick field guide.<br><br>There are 5 unique sprites in the world, and every game comes with 3. Players must trade with each other to find the other 2. There is always something new to discover, from a variety of different sprite attacks to special character abilities. ",
