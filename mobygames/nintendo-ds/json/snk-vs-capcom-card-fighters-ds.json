  "description": "In this unique strategy card fighting game a tower made to hold card tournaments has been taken over by the computer controlling it and the people inside brainwashed so that now they all want nothing more than to duel any who dare appose this computer to a game of cards.<br><br>The player must try to ascend the tower and try to get to this computer. To do that they will have to beat all of the characters on each floor. Once a floor has been cleared the boss of this floor will then appear, defeating them will grant the player access to the next floor. Some defeated characters also offer services once beaten such as a chance to buy more cards or trade them so the player can attempt to try and collect some of the 300+ different cards featured in the game.",
