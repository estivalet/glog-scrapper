  "description": "<i>POWDER</i> is a rogue-like featuring fast-paced gameplay in randomly generated dungeons. If you die, you have to start over again, because there is only one save slot, which will be deleted upon death. In every new game almost anything is randomized. Any item you pick up can have unknown effects. Some will aid you in your quest, but some will curse you. Only if you are brave enough to try out, you will know what potion will heal you. If you're not brave, but smart and have a spell book, you can also reveal such knowledge with magic.<br><br>You can't choose a class for your character at the beginning. But you can choose to worship one of seven gods at any time, which in turn will aid you, while others will punish you.<br><br>Your mission: You have to make your way through the dungeons to slay Baezl'bub and bring his black heart back to the surface.",
