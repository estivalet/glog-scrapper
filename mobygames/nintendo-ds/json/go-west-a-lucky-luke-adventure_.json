  "description": "<i>Go West: A Lucky Luke Adventure</i> is based on the animated movie of the same name and basically a mini game collection. The basic story is that the Daltons escape from the authorities, rob a few banks and hide in a settler's track to California. Of course Lucky Luke is already on their tail...<br><br>The game consists of 40 linearly arranged mini games which follow the movie story - in fact after every solved game the player can watch a short movie clip. Most mini games can be divided into three categories: movement (e.g. on a horse or in a plane) while dodging obstacles or drawing and rhythm games. There a also a few ones which don't fall into these categories, e.g. cooking. During these games the player alternately takes the role of all main characters. In comparison the the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/go-west-a-lucky-luke-adventure\">Windows and Wii version</a> the mini games in the DS version are adjusted to the technical abilities of the platform and use the stylus. There is also a new mini game, a side-scrolling platformer.",
