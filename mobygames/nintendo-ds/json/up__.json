  "description": "The Nintendo DS version of Up (based on the 2009 Pixar film of the same name) plays similarly to its other console cousins, where players need to guide Carl Fredricksen and Russell along Paradise Falls, as well as helping them use teamwork in order to advance through the various levels.<br><br>The main gameplay consists of guiding Carl and Russell to the exit of each level, using a variety of gadgets to help them along the way (such as Carl's hearing aid that drives away pesky hunting dogs). The main hub of the DS version takes place in a base camp, where players can play several minigames, view the various gadgets collected, view a collection of rare bugs, view the game's cutscenes, purchase supplies to help throughout the adventure and saving game progress.<br><br>The top screen displays vital statistics such as the level's map, the current running time and the partner's health bar. The Touch Screen is where the main gameplay takes place, while also displaying the current character's health and stamina bars, the current gadget in use and even the number of bugs collected (which help accumulate points to purchase supplies).<br><br>Players must also interact with a variety of objects such as levers, cable cars, crank elevators and rafts (which all require the stylus) to get around the levels. Dug and Kevin (the friendly characters that Carl and Russell encounter throughout the adventure) also provide great help as the game progresses.<br><br>DS Multi-Card Play allows 2 players to compete against each other in the 5 featured minigames. <br><br> ",
