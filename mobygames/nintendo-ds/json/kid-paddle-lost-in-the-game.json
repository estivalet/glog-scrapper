  "description": "<i>Kid Paddle: Lost In The Game</i> is a 3D side-scrolling platform game inspired by Midam's popular comic strip <i>Kid Paddle</i>.  Kid Paddle and his friends go play games at the City Game Arcade, but things turn sour when they become trapped inside the game and Kid Paddle's friends are being held captive by the evil blorks.  Kid Paddle must journey through four different worlds to save his friends by activating switches, jumping on platforms and fighting many different blorks.  It's also possible to play as Little Barbarian and save the princess in two of the game's six worlds.<br><br>The game features the same worlds and story as the Wii version, but has different gameplay. The player can collect coins, shoot blorks, buy upgrades from Mirador's shop. The game features traditional platforming elements such as pushing blocks and jumping on platforms.\n",
