  "description": "<i>Curling DS</i> is exactly what it sounds like, a handheld recreation of the winter sport. The player gets to pick one of nine international curling teams and guide it all the way through an international championship. In addition to the championship mode there is also a quick play mode for single matches and a training mode where the player can practice his skills. A multiplayer mode exists too where two players can compete either locally on one DS or through download play on two. In addition to the game there is also a guide to the sport where the player can learn about rules, strategy and equipment.<br><br>The game is entirely played with the stylus and the action is viewed from a top down perspective. The player controls both the curler and the sweepers. The player starts out with setting a goal in the target area where he wants the stone to go. Next the player uses a power bar to set the strength of the delivery and selects if he wants a left or right spin. The character will then start executing the delivery and the player has to touch the screen to increase the strength of the spin. The stone is released when the player looses his touch. The player will then have to start sweeping by sliding the stylus in front of the stone. The player will then get orders from the skip who will shout if he should sweep more, less or stop. ",
