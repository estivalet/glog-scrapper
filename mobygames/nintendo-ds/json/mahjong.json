  "description": "This adaptation of the classic Chinese board game offers 100 level for single-player sessions, with three difficulty levels. The levels can also be played in a campaign mode, with twelve illustrated stations. The main aim of the game is to make pairs of blocks disappear on a board where they are stapled on different layers. Removing matching blocks reveals the ones below, until the entire board is cleared or the player is stuck. The game includes a help function and blocks can be immediately selected using the stylus. There are different themes of blocks to choose from, including classic Chinese characters but also more general symbol. The game keeps track of the remaining blocks, the score, and there is an undo function.",
