  "description": "<i>Itadaki Street DS</i> is a Monopoly-style game from the Itadaki Street series, featuring characters from both the Mario series and the Dragon Quest series. Like Monopoly, players buy property and other players have to pay when they land on these properties. There are also some elements similar to the Mario Party series, such as minigames and different boards. The goal is usually to reach a certain total property value or to make a player bankrupt.",
