  "description": "<i>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? 3</i> is an entry in the <i>Carmen Sandiego</i> series for children aged eight to twelve. A.C.M.E. agents Julia Argent and Adam Shadow (formerly Shadow Hawkins) follow Carmen Sandiego to locations including Tokyo, Machu Picchu, and the German countryside. The game features puzzle-based play rather than the clue-based globehopping previously featured in the series. Most of the game consists of a linear story that is furthered through point-and-click elements with dialogue options in conversations. There are puzzles to solve and other elements include a digital handheld ACME computer and a world map to choose travel destinations.",
