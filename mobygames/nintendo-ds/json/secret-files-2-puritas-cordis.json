  "description": "Earth is being plagued with more and more disasters from a long list of catastrophes and at a UN plenum in New York scientists, experts and politicians try to find an explanation and a solution to the problems. Meanwhile Nina Kalenkow, the heroine of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/secret-files-tunguska\">Secret Files: Tunguska</a>, separated herself from Max Gruber and is on a little cruise to get her mind off of Max instead of going with her father to the UN plenum. But before she enters the ship, a strange man runs into her and gets run over a few seconds later.<br><br>This man was William Patterson, a friend of the bishop in Cambridge who was murdered a few weeks earlier by special forces because he was in the possession of an old parchment. Found in the church of Ashton, the local priest sent it to the bishop shortly before he was also killed. The special forces unit couldn't find the parchment in the University of Cambridge and no one really knows where it is. But in a fate of destiny, the suitcase of Mr. Patterson turns up in Nina's room aboard the ship - and instead of taking a vacation, Nina now finds herself in the middle of an all new adventure.<br><br>As its predecessor, <i>Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis</i> is a classic point &amp; click adventure. The 3D characters move around in front of hand drawn backgrounds, talk with other persons in multiple choice dialogues and collect many items in order to solve the many riddles that await them on their journey. Although the player mainly controls Nina during the course of the game, other characters will be playable (like the priest of Ashton) to get a more in depth look on the situation.<br><br>Looking at the surroundings, combining items and so on is all done by using the context sensitive mouse cursor. To help the player a little in finding everything, he can press the space bar and all hot spots in the current location will lighten up. The game also features a diary in which all the important events that have happened until now are explained, and an integrated riddle helper to provide tips.",
