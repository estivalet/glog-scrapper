  "description": "<i>Jump Superstars</i> is a 2D fighting game featuring over 150 characters from different Japanese animation (anime) and comic (manga) series. The idea of the game is to beat the opposing characters out but there are also missions where the goal is also something else, like kicking the chest for 20 times on time limit and doing secondary tasks during fights.<br><br>Playing <i>Jump Superstars</i> is done by controlling the character with the regular buttons which allow you to jump, block and make three different kinds of other moves. But what kind of moves you will make depends of your character since each character has his or her own special moves. You might also be able to switch between two or more characters during a fight by using the lower, touch-sensible screen of DS.

Touching these panels will result in various events at the battle, which itself, is shown at the upper screen of DS.
