  "description": "Jack Driscoll, scriptwriter, follows director Carl Dernham and actress Ann Darrow to Skull Island where Dernham intends to film his next movie. But primeval creatures await them: giant insects, dinosaurs, and King Kong. Based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Peter+Jackson\">Peter Jackson's</a> 2005 remake, King Kong lets you play as Jack Driscoll and Kong himself.<br><br>The DS version of the game is similar in concept to the console versions of the game: Jack's levels are mostly HUDless FPS levels set on Skull Island.  Some HUD information (such as ammunition information) has been moved down to the touch screen, where the player can use the DS screen like a trackball to control Jack.  Jack must use a variety of weapons to kill or repel Skull Island's fauna.<br><br>Kong's levels are third-person brawlers set on Skull Island, where Kong must puzzle his way through environmental obstacles and thrash his opponents.  Kong can swing over obstacles and scale walls as players make their way through his levels.",
