  "description": "<i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i> is based on the film of the same name and star the eternally-popular Canadian mutant. Like the movie, it covers James Howlett's escape from the Weapon X program that gave him his unbreakable adamantium skeleton and his early history. The story is presented as comic-style stills with text dialogue.  It is based on the engine made for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/spider-man-web-of-shadows\">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a>.<br><br>The game is divided into six acts. Wolverine must walk through 3D levels and defeat enemies. Attacks build a rage meter. Once it is full, you can active a feral mode. Then, you can attack any enemy on-screen using the stylus. He also can search for hidden scents, which he can follow to find new unlockable combos. As in the comics, Wolverine has a mutant healing factor, so all you need to do to heal is avoid being damaged for a time. There are also a number of hidden costumes to unlock, including some that aren't in the console versions.",
