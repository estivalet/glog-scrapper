There are three modes:\n<ul>\n<li>Pictionary Solo: the AI draws sketches and the player has to select the right clue. If correct, they advance on the Pictionary board. After three wrong guesses the game is over.</li>\n<li>Pass and Play: the gameplay is comparable to the previous mode, but players compete in teams.</li>\n<li>Pictionary Quizmode: also a single-player mode, where the player has to guess clues as fast as possible, in rows of 10, 20 or 30 correct answers.</li>\n</ul>",
