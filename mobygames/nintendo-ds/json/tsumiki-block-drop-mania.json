If a block comes to rest in a position \n      that isn't well-balanced, it could topple off. You can grab hold of \n      falling blocks using the stylus and slide them around or rotate them by \n      manipulating their centers of gravity. The key to building a good stack \n      is landing blocks in a stable, well-balanced position.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Features</b>\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"margin-top: 0; padding-left: 25.0px\">\n      • Stack piles of colorful shapes without dropping them.• Use \n      realistic physics and gravity to keep the pieces from falling.\n    </p>",
