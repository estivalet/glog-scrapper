  "description": "<i>My Horse &amp; Me 2</i> is the sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=My+Horse+%26+Me\">2007 equestrian sports and lifestyle video game</a>. The main differences: new disciplines (dressage, cross-country), added storyline, our horse has four parameters like cleanness, happiness, fitness and nutrition. <br><br>The storyline is simple: We arrive to our uncle's ranch dreaming about starting horse racing. But the situation isn't going very well. No horse has won for a few seasons and even worse, some are falling sick. As the story unfolds we realise that the only way to get the ranch out from its financial problems is to win the final race in Kentucky. <br><br>Other changes: new five mini-games loosely connected to the horse riding called &quot;fun games&quot; to unlock: Gather the foals, Play with a ball, Break in the Bull, Race with Katelyn, Labyrinth.<br><br>In &quot;My Horse and Me&quot; on the Wii platform, the horse jumps automatically and we steer the horse by moving wiimote and nunchuck up and down. In the second part, we steer the horse by turning wiimote and nunchuck left and right. We can also choose whether we jump automatically or by pressing the A button. Differences in gameplay are only because of different control (wiimote / keyboard / pad).<br><br>The game is also licensed by Federation Equestre Internationale FEI (International Equestrian Federation).\n",
