  "description": "<i>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</i> is the handheld version of the third entry of the <i>Splinter Cell</i> series. The basic storyline is still the same: The player takes the role of Sam Fisher who needs to save the world once again. This time the evil scheme is about information warfare and tries to drive America, South Korea and China into a war...<br><br>Even if the basic premise of every level is similar the actual design is different and more linear than in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tom+Clancy%27s+Splinter+Cell%3a+Chaos+Theory\">console/PC version</a>. Also one of the seven levels is completely new. Another big change are the controls: walking, fighting and performing acrobatic tricks use the control pad and buttons. But for moving the camera the player has to use the touch screen - which practically means he can't do both at the same time. He also activates his gadgets, e.g. night vision, there. The lockpicking mini game uses the stylus.<br><br>The game also features two multiplayer modes: in Versus (seven maps) the players choose between spy and soldier - the former have to hack computers, the others have to prevent that. In Cooperation two players solve five co-op levels in which one plays a soldier and the other a hacker.",
