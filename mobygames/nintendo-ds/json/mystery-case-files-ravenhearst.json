  "description": "The Queen of England has once again enlisted you with another case.  This time the mystery takes place in Ravenhearst manor.  Many have ventured into the manor and came out with odd accounts of the place.    The diary of a previous resident was found but pages are missing (aren't they always?).  And so, the Queen asks that you investigate, restore the diary and solve the Mystery of Ravenhearst Manor.<br><br>This is the third installment of the Mystery Case Files series.  The game play is essentially the same: seek out clues in a cluttered environment, when enough clues are found you will use the Crime Computer and solve a jigsaw puzzle.<br><br>A new twist to the game is that there are about 30 rooms in the manor and about half of the rooms is locked.  To unlock these rooms and find the clues inside it, you will have to solve puzzles.  The puzzles are point-and-click type puzzles requiring you to try various clickable objects in order to unlock the door.",
