  "description": "<i>Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt</i> is the demo version of the regular Nintendo DS title  <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/metroid-prime-hunters\">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a>.  This version of the game, as a demo, does not contain the complete adventure, but rather features three training missions of sorts to familiarize consumers with the Nintendo DS early in the lifecycle of the system.<br><br>The game is built on the framework of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gamecube/metroid-prime\">Metroid Prime</a> titles from the GameCube and Wii, developed by Retro Studios.  In this sense, it plays from a first-person perspective for regular play, and from a 3rd person perspective when Samus transitions to Morph Ball mode.  There are five choices for controlling the game available in the Options menu, and the ability for a player to enter his or her name for recording high scores.<br><br>Since the game is little more than a Nintendo DS tech demo, features and gameplay are fairly thin, although there are four gameplay modes.<br><br>Under the Training menu, the player has three single-player options as follows:<br><br><b>Regulator:</b> This mode plays the most like the regular Metroid Prime Hunters game.  The player ventures through a stage, solves a couple light puzzles, and collects a few items, and fights a generic boss.  This mode has a ten minute time limit.<br><br><b>Survivor:</b>  Essentially a survival mode where the player takes on gradual waves of enemies, until eventual defeat.<br><br><b>Morph Ball:</b>  Basically has the player meander through a timed maze in Morph Ball mode, all the while required to continue running through symbols on the ground.  <br><br><b>Multiplayer:</b>  Exactly what it sounds like.  A two-to-four person multiplayer mode making use of the DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.  Options exist for creating new multiplayer games or joining pre-existing ones.<br><br>\nThis title was not released for retail sale and was only put out for the purposes of demoing <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/metroid-prime-hunters\">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a> as well as the Nintendo DS system.",
