One Christmas day, siting in his office, Scrooge shows his mean character to anyone he meets as usual, even to his nephew and his clerk Bob Cratchit. His mean character does not seem to change until when he gets home, and meets his friend Jacob Marley's ghost, who tells him about the incoming arrival of some three spirits and warn him to change his ways...<br><br><i>Disney's a Chistmas Carol</i> is a point-and-click adventure game based on the 2009 cartoon movie <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which itself is also based on the novel with the same name by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,135739/\">Charles Dickens</a>.
