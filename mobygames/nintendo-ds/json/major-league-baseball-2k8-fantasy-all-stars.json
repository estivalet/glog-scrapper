  "description": "A different take on the long-running 2K baseball series, this version doesn't feature a season mode, but has a Pennant race tournament mode, exhibition mode with the ability to choose top players from all 30 major league teams, along with mini-games in an All-Star Training mode.<br><br>The player also has the option to build their own teams using real baseball players, creating their own all-star team.  The gameplay is different from others, utilizing the stylus pen at the bottom of the screen, players have to tap the screen or draw with their pen at certain points on a meter for power and position of pitches as well as batting, fielding and baserunning.<br><br>It does not feature actual MLB stadiums, instead it has fantasy stadiums such as the North Pole and the Everglades.  It supports DS wireless and Wi-Fi, letting players compete with others head-to-head.",
