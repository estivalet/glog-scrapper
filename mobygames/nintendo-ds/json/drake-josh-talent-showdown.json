  "description": "You play as Drake &amp; Josh (and Megan) in this action game in order to win the talent show, &quot;Teen American Talent&quot;. The game involves running around, avoiding bullies and jocks, finding people who are going to give you keys and various valuable items that are going to help you on your quest. Each character has different weapons: Drake has a water gun, a fire extinguisher, and running shoes. Josh has flash powder and a magic bunny hat. You switch characters by pressing the shoulder buttons. You also perfect your music skills by playing a guitar strumming mini-game. You strum the notes with your stylus as they pass over the target area. You can also earn power-ups by performing magic tricks which involves going through a maze with your stylus without going outside the lines.",
