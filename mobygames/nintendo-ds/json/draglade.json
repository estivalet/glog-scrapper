  "description": "Draglade is a unique take on fighting games.  Scientists have found a way to harness atmospheric energy called G-Cons, into a weapon called a glade, when hit against another object emits a sound.  Promoters realized the potential and soon developed a sport called Grapping, in which fighters use these glades not only to fight, but produce music as well in order to entertain fans.  You play as four different fighters, Hibito, Guy, Kyle, and Daichi, who's only goal is to become the top fighters in the sport of Grapping.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to Elite Beat Agents, you have to hit certain points on the screen at a certain time to create a rhythm in order to fight your opponent.  You can unlock other characters or customize your own, each with their own abilities and special moves.<br><br>You can also play against a friend using the Nintendo WFC multiplayer.",
