  "description": "A young girl in Kansas, Dorothy lives alone in a country house.  Her parents died many years ago.  One day, a gigantic cyclone sweeps up her house and sends her to the faraway magical land of Oz.  She follows a yellow brick road which leads to the Emerald City.  Along the way, she meets a Scarecrow, a Cowardly Lion, and a Tin Man, and together they meet the all-powerful Wizard of Oz, who promises to grant their wishes as long as they defeat the four witches of Oz, who are attempting to overthrow his kingdom.<br><br><i>The Wizard of Oz: Beyond the Yellow Brick Road</i> is a turn-based RPG that follows the general story of the book, but takes some liberties with the original source material.  Players move Dorothy via a trackball on the touch screen, which is rolled to control her direction and speed.  When she bumps into an enemy on the yellow brick road, a battle begins.  Initially Dorothy is on her own, but she quickly gains the companionship of the Scarecrow, Lion and Tin Man.  There are four &quot;slots&quot; per turn - while Dorothy and the Scarecrow only take up one slot per turn, the Lion takes up two, and the Tin Man, due to his strength, takes three.  It's up to the player to decide which characters to use for each turn.",
