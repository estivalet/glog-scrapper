The game consists of nine turns and the player who has the most diamonds at the end of those turns wins the game. To acquire the diamonds, players send their three diamond purchasing agents to one of the six locations in Angola Players have to attempt to outbid their competitor in how much they pay a local guide, but have to be careful in not overpaying as money is limited.
