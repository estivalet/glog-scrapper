  "description": "This port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ketsui-kizuna-jigoku-tachi\">Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi</a> was heavily reworked due to hardware limitations. Instead of the full game, it plays like a boss rush; it contains all of the game's midbosses and bosses, and only short segments in between bosses feature regular enemies. The scoring system was tweaked to account for the different gameplay focus.",
