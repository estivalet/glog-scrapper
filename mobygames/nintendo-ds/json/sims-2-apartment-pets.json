  "description": "In <i>The Sims 2: Apartment Pets</i>, you're living in your Uncle Bill's apartment. He gave the permission to change any of his furniture, so, you're now spending your money to customize your new home. But you're not only doing that. From time to time, your neighbours are dropping one of their pets for you or the janitor is giving you an animal found in the dumpster. It's up to you to train them.<br><br>The game is featuring the Sims trademark gameplay. You have to satisfy your Sim's daily needs, here reduced to four: Hunger, Comfort, Social and Bladder. You can also create your own character and change the interior of the apartment by upgrading items. You can also work at the local pet spa.<br><br>You also have to take care of the pets entrusted to you. When you have an animal, you have to feed it, train it, bath it, dress it and when it's ready for a new life, it's taken away in order for you to get a new pet to care.",
