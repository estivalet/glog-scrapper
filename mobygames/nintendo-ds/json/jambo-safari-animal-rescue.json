  "description": "Based on the original Sega arcade game, <i>Jambo! Safari: Animal Rescue</i> allows the player to play as one of four park rangers as they undertake missions around the basic premise of capturing and caring for wild African animals. the bulk of the game is centered on capturing the animals with ropes from the four vehicles in the game. Two of these vehicles are licensed Landrovers, while the other two are unlicensed, a quad bike and a Bombardier. The animals are captured in expansive, free-roaming African savannas and brought back to the base for treatment and care.<br><br>In addition to the straight forward arcade style gameplay, the DS version of the game also includes animal treatment mini-games, a larger variety of missions including wildlife photography and balloon rides, co-op missions and customizable characters and vehicles.",
