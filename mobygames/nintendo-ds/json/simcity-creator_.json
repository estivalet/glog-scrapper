  "description": "<i>SimCity Creator</i> for the DS is a continuation of the long-running SimCity series. Build up or destroy your city; you are the mayor, and whatever you say goes. This version features both the classic free-play mode, where there are no goals, and challenge mode, where you control your city from prehistoric times to the future. Each new era adds complexity, easing newcomers into the challenges of leadership, and changes the appearance of the buildings. By completing challenges, you'll unlock new time-periods and buildings for free-play.<br><br>Through the DS' wireless feature, you can send your friends pictures of your city, as well as sharing unlocked buildings.",
