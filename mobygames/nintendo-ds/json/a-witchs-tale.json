  "description": "A young witch-in-training named Liddell unleashes an ancient evil known as the Eld Witch while searching for powerful magic. The Eld Witch plunges the world into chaos with her monstrous forces, so Liddell, with the help of her vampire companion Loue, sets off to make things right. Players draw magical runes to combat the creatures they encounter in turn-based RPG battles with status effects and elements to consider. Along the way through these fairy tale kingdoms, Liddell receives help in battle from magical dolls she collects. Exploring dungeons and solving puzzles brings her closer to ridding the kingdoms of the curse of the Eld Witch, but she must take care of her dolls assistants along the way to ensure they can help her in combat.",
