  "description": "<i>Oshaberi Oumu</i> (????????) is a virtual pet simulation focusing on parrots. The player can select among six different parrot types and play various mini-games with them such as pulling the rope game. The player can name their parrots, talk to them using Nintendo DS's microphone in order to teach them new words, use stylus to teach them new tricks or just play with them. The overall feel for the pet parrot is similar to the voice system that comes with a Nintendo DS where you can use the parrot to imitate the word you have said and recorded. This game is sort of an upgraded and expanded version of that small demo app.",
