  "description": "<i>Think: Sinnes Trainer</i> offers the player to train the visual and aural senses. When the game is started for the first time, an individual quotient is determined and from there the training is built up, tracking the player's performance, through 22 exercises. These tests include steering a car past cones on a road, recognizing musical instruments, playing drums, moving through a labyrinth based on sound, and more common exercises such as recognizing numbers in the Ishihara colour test.<br><br>At the end of a workout, a number of relaxing exercises are offered. Players can also choose between a male or female trainer, with different training modes.",
