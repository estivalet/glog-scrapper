  "description": "<i>Glory Days 2</i> takes the premise of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/apple2/choplifter\">Choplifter!</a> and cranks it up a few notches. A strategic component was added that melds old gameplay with new game concepts. There are a lot of playable vehicles that become unlocked as you advance in the game.<br><br>The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.<br><br>The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units. These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is completely customizable for different parameters.<br><br>Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.",
