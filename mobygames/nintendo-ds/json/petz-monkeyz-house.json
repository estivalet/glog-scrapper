  "description": "In the likeness of the other games of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Petz+series\">Petz</a> for the Nintendo DS, but this time you take care of monkeys. The monkeys need to be fed, bathed and get entertained with toys to make sure they stay happy and healthy. The game also offers breeding possibilities, so that you can make your own breeds of monkeys to raise. You always start out with a baby monkey, which you can grow to an adult. The game has over 75 pieces of clothing and gives you the possibility to also travel with your monkeys. Multiplayer options make it possible to play with the monkeys of friends or crossbreed with their monkeys. ",
