The game takes football to the streets of numerous locations all around the world and features 18 international teams and a selection of more than 250 star players. The game can be played with either buttons, or the for the DS unique stylus control. Movement is done with the control pad, all other actions can be done with the stylus. Shooting is done by sliding the stylus towards the goal, while passes are made by touching in the direction of a team mate. When defending a slide is used for tackling. <br><br>Doing tricks is a central part of the series and this DS iteration is no different with a number of different moves. These are done by combining different stylus slides. For each successful trick, the player is awarded trick points that increases his gamebreaker meter. Once full the gamebreaker can be triggered. The gamebreaker is a sort of quick time event where the player has to touch the touch screen when an icon appears. When successful this will lead to a goal. When the opposition gets a gamebreaker, the player can counter it by touching the screen faster. <br><br>In addition to standard friendly matches the game also features a street challenge mode and a kick ups mode. In street challenge the player has to complete events to earn a reputation. To get a high reputation for the player not only needs to win, but to do it with a team with good chemistry so that the team performs as a group. By being successful in the street challenge the player earns unlockables. The kick ups mode is a rhythm action mini game where the player has to touch the screen in rhythm with the music. The game is also playable in multiplayer for two players through wireless connection. ",
