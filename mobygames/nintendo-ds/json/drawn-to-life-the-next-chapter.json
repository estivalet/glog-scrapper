  "description": "The Creator's Hero had saved the land!  All seemed well again for the Raposa.  But, one day, a villain named Wilfre appeared, draining the color out from the Raposas' world and kidnapping their people!  The Creator needed to act fast - it was time to send the Hero back into action once more.<br><br><i>Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter</i> is the sequel to the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=785138361314\">Drawn to Life</a>.  As with the previous game, the player custom draws their player character and explores a side-scrolling platform world, solving puzzles and defeating enemies.  Coins are strewn throughout the world which can be used to purchase items in the village shop, and each level hides a special giant pirate coin.<br><br>The player can now add up to four arms and four legs to their characters, and at certain points in the game, they also get the ability to create and transform into two different characters.  Firstly, there is the &quot;blob&quot; form, which moves more slowly but can squeeze through narrow passages that the hero could not get through.  Secondly, there is the &quot;spider&quot; form, which can crawl up walls (excluding ones covered in moss) and shoot webbing to swing with.",
