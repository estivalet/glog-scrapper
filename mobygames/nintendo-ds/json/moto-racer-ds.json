  "description": "<i>Moto Racer DS</i> is the second adaptation of the motorcycle racing series for handheld devices, following <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/moto-racer-advance\">Moto Racer Advance</a>. Now using a 3D engine, the game offers 36 bikes and 40 tracks. True to the original concept of the series, it offers races on paved asphalt (Moto GP), all-terrain (Super Cross) and Traffic where roads are filled with vehicles that need to be dodged. The available game modes include championship, single trace, time trial, and mirror tracks. There are three difficulty levels and races are often grouped together in a cup. The different bikes can be controlled using both automatic and manual transmission. They differ from each other based on acceleration, weight, speed and turbo.<br><br>While racing the environment is shown on the top screen. The bottom screen holds the course map and shows the current position. Compared to the previous GBA title it returns to the Super Cross dirt tracks of the original game: set indoor and with a focus on the rider's pose and tricks. There is also a separate Freestyle mode riding alone. In Moto GP there are missions races where the rider needs to be photographed by a radar violating the speed limits on a busy road. Other missions include slalom and collecting items. Nitro is used in the more traditional and realistic way. If it is used too long in succession while doing the wheelie, the rider will crash, so corrections and moderation are needed.<br><br>The riders can be controlled used the regular D-pad and buttons, or using the stylus on the bottom screen to accelerate, brake, go left and go right, by tapping the corresponding directions on the screen. Using a link cable up to eight players can race against each other simultaneously.",
