  "description": "<i>M&amp;M's Kart Racing</i> is a takeoff of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496735913\">Mario Kart DS</a>.  Featuring eleven tracks including a farm, the city, the Arctic, a land of chocolate and an alien spacecraft to name a few.  You can also race as the five different M&amp;M's colors seen in the commercials - Red, Yellow, Green, Blue and Orange.  It also has three game modes: Tournament, Time Trial and Multiplayer.  However, unlike Mario Kart DS you need another copy of the game to play against someone in Multiplayer.<br><br>There are also four power-ups you can used during the race to help you win, they include: a homing missile to slow down an opposing racer in front of you, a barrel of oil to slow down racers chasing you, a cup of hot chocolate that can boost your speed and a candy bar to refill your gas tank.
