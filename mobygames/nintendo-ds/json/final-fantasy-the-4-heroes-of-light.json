  "description": "Brandt is a fourteen-year-old boy living in the country of Horne. One day, the king summons him, only to send the boy on a perilous quest: Princess Aire has been kidnapped by the evil Witch of the North, and Brandt must rescue her. However, this quest is just a beginning of a long adventure, as Brandt and his new friends soon discover that the entire kingdom is in danger because of a pact that was signed between the king and the witch...<br><br><i>Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light</i> is a spin-off of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series, and also the first <i>Final Fantasy</i> title exclusively for the Nintendo DS. It plays much like the classic 2D entries in the series, and also features a class system, disguised as the &quot;Crown System&quot;; a character's class is dependent on what crown he/she wears. The player gains these crowns during the course of the game. The game also features a &quot;day and night&quot; system; as the party traverses the overworld, time flows. This affects the game in that some stores open/closes at certain times. It might also do various other things.<br><br>The battle system is somewhat simplistic, but also unique; Action Points, or AP, play a big part in the battles. Each of the player-controlled characters has an AP meter, each topping at 5. A regular attack consumes 1 AP, and magic consumes 2 or more; this also means there are no mana points in the game. The player has the choice of either waiting a turn to gain 1 AP, or use the Boost command to gain 2 in one turn; by using the latter, the character in question cannot attack that round.<br><br>As a first in the series, the characters' appearances change depending on what weapons and armours they have equipped - as opposed to only weapons visibly changing.<br><br>The game was developed by the same team responsible for the DS remakes of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/final-fantasy-iii_\"> Final Fantasy III</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/final-fantasy-iv\"> IV</a>.",
