  "description": "Newly organized soccer team of a freshmen year in Kouenji Academy for girls achieve the victory in a national championship. Now, the graduation is approaching and the academy suddenly got a new female headmaster who decisively disbanded the soccer club and fired the consultant. The protagonist, Toushi Moeru (??? ??), is looking for members for a new soccer club, despite what the principal thinks, and is setting his aim to achieve victory in the world championship.<br><br>The gameplay occurs in monthly intervals (from April to December). Each month is split into four weeks, and each week, except the last one, the player goes through adventure mode, practice mode, and free time mode. The fourth week is a match against the opposing team. The adventure mode is typical visual novel style gameplay where dialogues with other characters occur, focusing on you helping student girls deal with their problems, with multiple choices giving you a choice on how you wish to proceed or handle certain problem at hand. During April you focus on gathering members for your team, from May to August you participate in national championship, and finally, from September to December you participate in world championship.<br><br>The practice mode puts you in a role of an observer where you check the progress of the players on your team. After each practice, your members will either excel in their training (increase stamina or learn special moves) or display their feelings toward your training and guidance (such as love or trust). The free time mode lets you explore the town and academy grounds and talk to other characters. Various locations contain hidden dragon items which can be collected and exchanged with certain character in town which will exchange information for dragon items. Before each match, there will be dispute among the members of your team which you can resolve by pressing the right button at the appropriate time during their conversation. By resolving their dispute, their condition and coordination will be better when the game starts. The game results in game over if your players get disqualified or if you lose the match.",
