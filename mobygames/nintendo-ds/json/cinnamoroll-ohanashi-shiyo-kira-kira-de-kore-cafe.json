  "description": "One day out of the blue, a dog with large ears that enables it to fly, dropped out of the sky and decided to help you run the cafe. The dog's name is Cinnamon and he might've caught a sniff of the cinnamon rolls that your cafe had to offer. With your new little aid, you'll be able to tell Cinnamon what to do, talk to him via microphone and send him on errands (i.e. to buy a milk or other ingredients necessary for recipes).<br><br>Cinnamon is one of the many licensed characters from Sanrio, a Japanese company specialized in creating cute characters (more widely known by its Hello Kitty character). Cinnamon character is a small white puppy with large ears which he uses to fly. He lives at cafe Cinnamon and he's named Cinnamon not after the cafe, but because his tail is curled up like a cinnamon roll. Cinnamon character was created by Sanrio designers in 2002.",
