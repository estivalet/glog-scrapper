  "description": "Based on the hit blockbuster film, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End brings players back for another adventure on the high seas. The story begins shortly after the events of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. Captain Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl have been dragged to the depths by the mighty Kraken, Davy Jones' monstrous servant. It would seem that Davy Jones is appeased, Jack's debt has been paid, but a new foe has arisen. With Davy Jones' heart in his possession, Lord Cutler Beckett hopes to control the ocean with the might of the Flying Dutchman, Jones' ship. The end of the pirates, it seems, is near, but Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, and the rest of the Pearl's crew aren't ready to give up yet. They'll travel to World's End and Davy Jones' locker to save Jack and convene the Brethren Court, their last change to make a stand against Lord Beckett and restore freedom to the seas.<br><br>Players control all three heroes from the film, Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann in this third person action adventure game for the Nintendo DS. The game takes players to many memorable locations featured in the movie including Singapore, Davy Jones' Locker, Shipwreck Cove, and even inside the Flying Dutchman itself. In addition to the swashbuckling combat and acrobatic world navigation, players use the touch screen to unlock chests and doors. <br><br>Available only on the Nintendo DS, players engage in touch screen duels with the pirate lords. Using the stylus, players thrust and parry to overcome their opponents.<br><br>New game modes are available with multiple cartridges or Nintendo DS Download Play. Using the Nintendo DS' wireless capabilities, players can connect over the ad-hoc network and play one on one duels or join in a game of Liar's Dice with up to three other players.",
