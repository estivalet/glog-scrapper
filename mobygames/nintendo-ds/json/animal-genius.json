  "description": "'Animal Genius' allows players to play 5 different types of games in order to test their intelligence of the animal kingdom. The main objective of the game is to collect a certain number of points to earn a total of 25 animals across 5 different locations around the world.<br><br>The games consist of the following: <br><br>Maze Munch: Control one of 4 different animals to complete a number of stages using their special abilities (e.g.Press the A button to make a lion pounce in order to catch zebras).<br><br>Scratch And See: Use the Nintendo DS stylus to scratch off part of a hidden picture to reveal part of an animal photograph, then select the correct answer.<br><br>Creature Collector: Tap the correct animals that belong to a certain group (such as the animals that have fur, or the slowest animals).<br><br>Matchomatic: Use the stylus to flick the correct animal that matches part of the close-up shown onscreen (e.g. Match the animals to their eyes).<br><br>When the games are answered successfully with time still running, a bonus question will appear. Answering this question correctly adds additional bonus points based on the remaining time.<br><br>When the player collects the correct number of points for each animal, he/she must answer 10 questions about the animal in order to add it to the corresponding location. Upon collecting the animal, players can tap it within the environment to learn an interesting fact about it.<br><br>Occasionally, an 'Animal Alert!' moment occurs (only if the player unlocks animals from 2 different areas) in which the player must travel to the location indicated and tap on the animal that doesn't belong to that environment, in order to transfer it back to its respective area safely. Players can't earn more animals until this feat must be accomplished...<br><br>The game makes brilliant use of the Nintendo DS stylus with all 5 games support.\n",
