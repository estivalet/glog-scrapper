  "description": "Someone's messed up all of the Disney stories in the vaults!  Help Jiminy Cricket and Tinkerbell right the stories and give a happy ending.    Sort stories from popular Disney franchises including The Little Mermaid, Lilo and Stitch, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh, Pirates of the Caribbean and The Nightmare Before Christmas, to name just a few.<br><br><i>Meteos: Disney Magic</i> is a Disney themed version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496735739\">Meteos</a> for the Nintendo DS.  Using your stylus, shift the blocks up and down (or, new to this version, left to right as well) to rearrange them.  Once there are three or more of the same block in a row horizontally or vertically, the blocks and all those above rocket up towards the top of the bin, before beginning to settle down again.  Blast them all off the screen to clear them.  Special power ups sometimes appear, such as the Rocket Block, which lets you blast up a large amount of blocks with a single tap, and the Replacing Block, which substitutes all blocks of one color to another.<br><br>There are different modes of play for <i>Meteos: Disney Magic</i>.  You can choose Story Mode, which takes you through a set of Disney stories to play.  Depending on the difficulty, you can choose a path to take and unlock new stories for play in other modes.  Challenge Mode has you playing through any story you've previously unlocked, either in Simple Mode (play until you lose) or Time Attack.  Versus CPU sees you fighting against an opponent, either in Survival (play until either player loses) or Time Mode, which has you clearing as many blocks as possible in a limited time.  You can also play against your friends either with Single Cart or Multi Cart Multiplayer, up to four players.",
