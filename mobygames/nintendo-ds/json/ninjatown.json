  "description": "<i>Ninjatown</i> is a family-friendly tower defense game for the Nintendo DS that features the artwork and characters of ex-EGM editor Shawn Smith's Shawnimals universe. In the game, players must build Ninja Huts at key spots along a set pathway to defend each of the game's 36 levels from the invading forces of Mr. Demon. Players can build up to eight different kinds of Ninja Huts, each kind containing its own category of Ninja, from Wasabi pea-shooting Sniper Ninjas to bearded Mountain Ninjas. <br><br>There are also a variety of Ol' Master Ninja Powers that can help the player in a pinch. These range from blowing into the DS microphone to push enemies backwards with a gust of wind to tapping enemies on screen in a short period of time in order to deal extra damage to them.<br><br>The game is divided into 9 districts, each containing 3 standard tower defense maps and 1 boss map. Each level in the game takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, with the full game clocking in at around 6-8 hours.",
