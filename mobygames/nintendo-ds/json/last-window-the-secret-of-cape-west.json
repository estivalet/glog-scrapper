  "description": "<i>Last Window: The Secret of Cape West</i> is an adventure video game. It is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hotel-dusk-room-215\">Hotel Dusk: Room 215</a>, and has the same main character, Kyle Hyde. Kyle is a ex-police agent. It takes place in 1980, one year after <i>Hotel Dusk: Room 215</i>. The characters in the game look like they have been sketched with a pencil.<br><br><i>Last Window</i> plays the same as its predecessor, <i>Hotel Dusk</i>. On the touchscreen you see a map of your surroundings, with your character, and on the top screen you see through the eyes of Kyle Hyde. The game can be controlled either by using your stylus to direct Kyle on the map, or with the Control Pad. The goal is to talk to other characters, and get information to solve mysteries surrounding Kyle Hyde.<br><br>One of the main differences between <i>Last Window</i> and <i>Hotel Dusk</i> is in how they handle different choices.  While <i>Hotel Dusk</i> would punish you with a wrong choice by ending in a Game Over screen, <i>Last Window</i> instead chooses to handle this by changing the story itself, rather than making the game instantly end.",
