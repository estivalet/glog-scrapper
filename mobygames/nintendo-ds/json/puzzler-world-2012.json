  "description": "<i>Puzzler World 2012</i> is the third entry of the <i>Puzzler World</i> series of video games (based on the British puzzling magazines by Puzzler Media).<br><br>Just like the previous efforts, this game features 16 modes of puzzles including Wordsearch, Fitword, Sudoku and much more. New gameplay modes include Pathfinder (where you need to find random words in a sequential order by drawing a path), Sum People (where you need to solve some mathematical problems, with each unique face representing a certain number), Takegaki (where you need to draw a continuous loop without crossovers), Mix Up (where you need to enter an anagram of the current clue), Spiral Crosswords, Missing Links (where you need to fill in the word that links 3 separate others within the clues), Suko (a number puzzle similar to Sudoku, except you also need to take the overlapping quadrants into account) and Dropzone (where you need to tap a letter in each column shown to remove it, revealing 6 hidden words).<br><br>This game still includes the Trophy Room (where players need to fill in certain game conditions to win several trophies) and Master Mode (puzzles for the most experienced players) present in Puzzler World 2011. Also new is the Prize Board (a Pachinko-esque board where you simply pull the firing mechanism to launch the ball) which still offers Hint Tokens and Puzzler Letters, but replaces the Prize Wheel taken from its predecessor.<br><br>A 3D-enhanced edition was also released for the Nintendo 3DS (entitled <i>Puzzler World 2012 3D</i>) which still offers the same gameplay as its DS counterpart, but boasts better visual graphics.",
