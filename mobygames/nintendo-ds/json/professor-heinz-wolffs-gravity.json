  "description": "<i>Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity</i> is a puzzle game similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Incredible+Machine\">Incredible Machine series</a>. During the 100 levels the goal is always to press a button. To achieve this goal the player has a selection of items to his disposal - nothing fancier than boards or balls - to build a construction of chain reactions. When he starts the experiment, a ball (in seldom cases a vehicle) gets released to set the thing in motion. An innovation compared to similar games is that the physics simulation doesn't get disabled during the building phase. This means the player can destroy his constructions when being careless during placing another item. There is also a help functions which gives hints to the correct solution.<br><br>By beating levels the player unlocks so-called sandbox levels where he can freely experiment with the physics engine. Mini games, e.g. building a tower which has to withstand an earthquake, can be played against other players. There are a small differences between the versions: the PC version offers an editor to build own experiments and the DS version offers fewer sandbox levels and mini games.",
