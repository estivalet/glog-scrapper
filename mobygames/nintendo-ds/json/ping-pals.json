  "description": "Originally conceived as a Nintendo DS launch title before <i>Pictochat</i> was announced as a packed-in feature of the DS, <i>Ping Pals</i> lets players create an avatar to send chats and doodles wirelessly with their friends.  Although only one person needs a <i>Ping Pals</i> cartridge to start the chat, the game uses unlockable clothing and accessories as incentive to purchase their own cartridge and chat away.  Have no friends?  <i>Ping Pals</i> can even simulate chat with a simple AI chatbot.<br><br>Players can purchase items from a store using coins or trade for them with other players.  Coins are earned in various ways, including receiving a daily allowance, chatting for a long time, typing special predetermined keywords, and playing minigames. ",
