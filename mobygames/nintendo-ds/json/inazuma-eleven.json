  "description": "<i>Inazuma Eleven</i> is a blend of a football (soccer) game and traditional RPG. The game stars Mark Evans, the captain and goalkeeper of Raimon Junior High School's football team. However, it seems that he is the only one who cares about playing as his teammates prefer to waste time in the clubroom. Because of that their club is the laughing stock of the whole school and on the verge of being disbanded. The team is given one last chance in winning a friendly match against one of the best teams. When all seems lost, there appears a transfer student and well-known player – Axel Blaze. The team now has hopes for winning, but there are others that, for some reason, don't want the club to exist.<br><br>The game is divided into classic top-down exploration, during which the player walks around and interacts with NPCs, and real-time football matches. The matches play out in real-time and are controlled only with the stylus. All of the teammates on the field move automatically with the player being able to manually draw or point to their destination. Encountering a rival or enemy goal, the game pauses and the player is able to choose his action. These consist of standard moves and anime-styled supernatural skills.<br><br>As in any RPG, teammates gain levels and improve their statistics, which affect the way they perform and the outcome of their actions. The team is fully customizable with your teammates' position on the field and hundreds additional players among whom to recruit new ones from.",
