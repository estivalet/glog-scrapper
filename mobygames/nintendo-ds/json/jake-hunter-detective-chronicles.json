  "description": "<i>Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles</i> is a crime-solving game with a look that resembles that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Ace+Attourney%2fGyakuten+Saiban+series\">Phoenix Wright</a>. In the game, the player takes control of Jake Hunter as he solves three murders that have taken place. The gameplay consists of searching for clues at the murder scenes and talking to witness and suspects.  During the game, the player can hit the &quot;L&quot; button to send Jake to a &quot;Smoking Screen&quot; in which Hunter explains what evidence has been collected and what suspects have been eliminated.<br><br>This is the US version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Tantei+Jinguuji+Saburo+DS%3a+Inishie+no+Kioku\">Tantei Jinguuji Saburo DS: Inishie no Kioku</a>. That Japanese version includes five cases from the mobile versions as well as an entirely new case. This US release however only contains three cases and not the new one.",
