  "description": "Nancy Drew has been invited to Twin Elms, the home of her friend Helen, to investigate a possible haunting. Ghost or not, strange things are happening in the mansion, and Nancy Drew plans to get to the bottom of this mystery.<br><br><i>Nancy Drew: the Hidden Staircase</i> is a cross between a hidden object game and a more traditional adventure. Various characters will give Nancy lists of items to find, but unlike a regular hidden object game, where everything is on one screen, Nancy will need to check every room of the large mansion to find all the misplaced items. There are three chapters, and a more puzzle-oriented finale. The player's progress is automatically saved at the beginning of each chapter. Upon completion of each chapter, a score will be given based on the time taken.",
