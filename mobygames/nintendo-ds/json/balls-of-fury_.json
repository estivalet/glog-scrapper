  "description": "<i>Balls of Fury</i> on the DS general design is almost identical to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Balls+of+Fury\">Wii version</a>, save for some minor differences.<br><br>The perspective has been heightened, to a more top-down view, although the paddle is still shown from a first-person perspective. Movement of the paddle is entirely done through the stylus, with the buttons used to add additional effect. The tournament mode has been removed and it is replaced by a multi-player mode, with up to two players through a wireless connection. Next to that, the game contains the same modes, characters, venues, options and two additional trophies.<br><br>An extra mini-game has been added during the credits where the player can swat bees with the head of a spoon like Randy Daytona in the movie. Players need to swat as many bees as possible before the credits end.",
