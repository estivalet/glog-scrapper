  "description": "A sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puyo+Puyo+Fever\">Puyo Puyo Fever</a>, the next-gen re-imagining of the classic arcade puzzle game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a>, in which you play against either an AI or player controlled opponent to see who can stack and arrange the falling blobs (or &quot;puyos&quot;) in the correct color patterns that allow you to send &quot;garbage&quot; puyos to the opposing player and help flood him and lose.<br><br>The game includes a single-player arcade mode, as well as a story mode with 3 different characters and campaigns that take you across the game world battling different sets of enemies. The &quot;fever&quot; meter from the previous game returns (which increases the number and abilities of the garbage puyos you send depending on how many puyos you chain in succession) and a new ranking system has been implemented that awards you money you can use between stages to buy special items that modify the game rules in your favor.",
