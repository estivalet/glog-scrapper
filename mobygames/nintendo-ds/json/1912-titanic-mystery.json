  "description": "On the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, a replica is launched to complete the maiden voyage interrupted by the tragic events one century before. However, one of the passengers receives a note about a bomb hidden somewhere on the boat. The passenger must follow the clues left behind by the terrorist, searching the ship to find the device and prevent another tragedy.<br><br><i>1912: Titanic Mystery</i> is a hidden object game with adventure elements, where the main objective is to find and click on all the items listed at the left side of the screen, on the various rooms and other locations filled with scattered items around the ship. All the locations have three gameplay sections: initially the player has to find several instances of the same item, then search for a list of objects and finally collect all the pieces of a special tool, that appears as a picture below the list.<br><br>The tool has to be dragged and dropped on a specific portion of the scenery to access one of the mini-games. These puzzles have to be solved to complete the scene and move to the next one. The mini-games appear on a window at the center of the screen, where the player must reassemble jigsaw puzzles, find all the differences between two similar images, decode Morse code messages with a machine and perform other similar activities. They can be skipped, with a penalty of 10 minutes. The hint button is a pile of lifesavers, showing the position of one of the required items when activated. Extra buoys can be found on each location, with a maximum of 6 stored at any time. The completed puzzles can be replayed from the main menu.",
