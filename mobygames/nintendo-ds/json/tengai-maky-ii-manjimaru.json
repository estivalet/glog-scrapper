  "description": "Many years ago, the legendary warriors of the Fire Clan were expelled from the Garden of Eden, and built the wonderful land Jipang. Thousand years later, Jipang is entering its medieval era. It seems that the province Hida is suffering from a curse placed upon it by the evil clan of the Dark Orchids. To destroy the Orchids, a young boy named Manjimaru has to fight the demons who protect them, find companions who would help him on the quest, and prove he is worthy of his great legacy as the descendant of the Fire Clan.<br><br><i>Tengai Maky? II: Manjimaru</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tengai-maky-ziria\">Tengai Maky?: Ziria</a>. Though not connected to its predecessor directly story-wise, the game is set in the same semi-humorous rendition of feudal Japan, and shares many recurrent gameplay-related and stylistic elements. The player navigates a party of up to four characters on a vast overworld divided into provinces, each with its own capital city and several smaller towns. Randomly encountered enemies are fought in turn-based, first-person view combat. Like in the previous game, magic spells must be obtained by locating Tengu Retreats; they can be then equipped on any character and swapped between them.<br><br>Enemy hit points are displayed during battles, and characters are restored to full health when leveling up. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voiceovers advance the story. As opposed to the previous game, <i>Manjimaru</i> has several audio music tracks in addition to synthesized ones. ",
