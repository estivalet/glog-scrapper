  "description": "<i>Sid Meier's Civilization: Revolution</i> is a handheld version of the console ports, based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization-iv\">Civilization IV for the PC</a>. As a turn-based strategy game it features all the key features of its related versions: exploration of a world map, development of one's own civilization and diplomatic encounters, trade and war with rivalling nation leaders. All playable parties are based on real-life nations past and present.<br><br>To make up for the Nintendo DS limited controls, smaller screen size and weaker processing capabilities some game features were condensed or cut; e. g. landscape tiles surrounding cities are not developed by worker units anymore, diplomatic options were slightly simplified, unit variety reduced and victory conditions altered.<br><br>The game makes use of the Nintendo DS unique features by offering stylus controls and using the top screen to relay important unit, tile and city information and combat animation.",
