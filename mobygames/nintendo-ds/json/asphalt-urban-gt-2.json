  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Asphalt%3a+Urban+GT\">Asphalt: Urban GT</a> continues the fast-paced racing of the original game with various additions. Races take place on eight locations all over the world. While racing, smashing other cars, or avoiding the police, there is cash to collect. Money becomes available by risky driving, wiping out opponents or cops, or by picking up items. When a certain cash level is reached, new elements are opened up, such as parts to tune the car (for free), new tracks, new vehicles, or a new game mode. For the first time in the series, bikes are also available.<br><br>While racing, a boost meter can be built up by picking up specific items or taking out other cars. A double boost can be applied for high speeds, while a double tap to the right or the left makes the car drift. By ignoring all driving regulations, a wanted meter slowly builds up. The cops will chase with regular patrol cars, helicopters, or they will set up a road block.<br><br>The game offers 4 modes:<ul><li><i>Evolution</i>: race for the first place.</li><br><li><i>Duel</i>: race against a single opponent, with a bet. The higher the prize, the tougher the cops are.</li><br><li><i>Beat 'Em All</i>: win the race by wiping out all opponents before the finish line is reached.</li><br><li><i>Cop Chase</i>: play as patrol car and wipe out all illegal racers.</li></ul>The game's theme song is a digitized version of Moby's Lift Me Up (which is also the intro music for UK TV's Formula One racing coverage) and the girls of the pop group The Pussycat Dolls make an appearance before and after each race.",
