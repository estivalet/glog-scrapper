  "description": "<i>SimCity DS</i> brings the classic series to the handheld consoles.<br><br>As the Mayor placed in charge of running their own city, players use the touchscreen to build up and run their town, providing commercial, residential and industrial zones, protection against crime and fire, entertainment areas and even airports, highways and railways for the SimCitizens to travel.<br><br>Players also have to contend with natural (and unnatural) disasters, the pressures of an ever-expanding city, and of course, public opinion, which can make a job very difficult if things get out of control.<br><br>New to this version is the inclusion of wireless communication with other Mayors via a Post Office.  Players can send letters to each other, giving a short summary of the state of their city. When players send letters to each other, they earn special monuments for their cities.  Additionally, when disaster strikes, the Mayor can take a more hands-on approach in directly rescuing their SimCitizens.",
