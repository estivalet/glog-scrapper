  "description": "This video game is based on the Top Trumps card game and is set in the Doctor Who universe and has characters from the television series including the 10th Doctor (played by David Tennant), Martha Jones, Capt Jack Harkness, Dalek, Cyberman and Slitheen.  It also uses the animation style of the spinoff television series The Infinite Quest and Scream of the Shalka.  <br><br>Each player has a deck of cards and attempts to win all the other player's cards.  Each card has a character or event from the Doctor Who universe along with different statistics.  A player chooses which statistic to use to compare with someone else's card and the higher one will result in the capture of the card with the lower statistic value.  There are two play modes: adventure mode where one player goes against AI controlled opponents, and versus mode where two players go head-to-head.",
