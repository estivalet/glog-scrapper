Add the fact that the mysterious stranger slipped away without answering any of her question and you'll understand that Natalie's detective side was awakened in less time than you can imagine... So now she's determined to search for her friend and to solve the mystery behind it all...<br><br><i>Natalie Brooks: Mystery at Hillcrest High</i> is the third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Natalie+Brooks+Series\">Natalie Brooks series</a>.
