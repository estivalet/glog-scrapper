  "description": "The angel LuLu asks high school student Akuji Nishimura to locate a witch who has sneaked into his school. There are 8 possible suspects, between 12 and 23 years old, with different abilities such as transformation, energy balls, potions, teleportation and more. To find her, Akuji has to gather enough evidence to corner one of the suspects, and then the player has to <i>touch</i> her with the stylus, guiding Akuji's hands, to check for a witch mark. This curious feature, although a minor part of the game, made it infamously dubbed <i>that-Japanese-young-witches-toucher</i>. In these scenes, Akuji can flirt with the characters, show them items and perform actions such as kissing, touching, or jiggling their breasts. The visual style is anime-inspired.<br><br>The game interface is similar to the Japanese date simulations. Players just have to pick a location. If there is an important character present, the story continues, otherwise another location needs to be chosen. Most of the game takes place inside the school, but there are also a few areas outside of it. After a certain amount of items and information, Akuji faces a boss. By tapping the stylus, he can deflect energy balls and attack. A certain amount of characters can be unlocked, granting new abilities during battle. During scenario sets, black pandas appear, used to unlock new gameplay options.",
