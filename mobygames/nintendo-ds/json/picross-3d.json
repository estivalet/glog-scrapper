  "description": "<i>Picross 3D</i> is a pseudo-sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=045496738952\">Picross DS</a>. As with the original game, the player's goal is to uncover the hidden image by using the number clues as a guide. Unlike <i>Picross DS</i>, where the puzzles were flat, in this game, each puzzle is encased in a cube of a varying size and shape. By chipping away and rotating the cube, the player can reveal the hidden picture.<br><br>The game has approximately 350 puzzles, across a variety of different themes. Each puzzle is grouped into a particular theme, such as Beach, Sports, or Fire. When all the puzzles are found for a theme, a medal is added to the theme to indicate that it is complete. Nearly every puzzle has a possibility for a three star rating. To earn all three stars, the player must:\n<ul><li>Solve the puzzle;\n<li>Complete the puzzle within the time limit;\n<li>Not make any mistakes.</ul>\nAs with <i>Picross DS</i>, this game features a puzzle creator. The player can create their own puzzles and then, using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, send them onto the Internet to trade with friends, as well as receive additional ones.",
