  "description": "Glory of Heracles is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo DS.<br><br>The story begins with a boy, washed up on the Island of Crete. The boy has no idea who he is, and soon after exploring a part of the island, he starts meeting companions that tell him that he's immortal, same as them. So together, the group decides to travel to Olympus, the home of the Gods, in order to hear answers about their immortality and fate.<br><br>Glory of Heracles uses turn-by-turn gameplay in battles, in which you can use melee or ranged attacks, cast spells or use items, skills and abilities. The order of attacks is determined by the agility the characters, and with certain spells or effects.\nThe attack spells can be powered up with the stylus by inputting commands on the touch screen, and the same goes for some of the skills.\nEther is the source of magic in the game. The characters cast spells by using ether. There are five different elements of ether in the game, namely fire, wind, earth, ice, and dark. If the character doesn't have enough ether to cast a certain spell, the difference is subtracted from the character's hitpoints, known as ether reflux.\nThe player can learn new skills and magic by visiting temples or Prometheus statues. This can also be achieved by using various equipment found in the game world.",
