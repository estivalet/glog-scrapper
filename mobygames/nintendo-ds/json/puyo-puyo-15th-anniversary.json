  "description": "It's Tournament Day at Primp Town Magic School! And the reward is fit for a true Puyo master - a special Puyo Medal that will grant the bearer a single specific wish of their choosing. All the Primp Town students are here and raring to go...\nBut wait! What's this? Six comets - and they look oddly familiar!<br><br>In <i>Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary</i>, 22 Puyo poppers (6 returning from the Compile Puyo series) gather to battle for Puyo bragging rights. For the most part, the game remains the same - match four Puyos in a row and swallow up your opponent in an avalanche of Nuisance Puyos. But the rules change each time you face a new opponent, with a series of new modes (plus the basic modes from the first two &quot;Puyo&quot; games and also from &quot;Puyo Pop Fever&quot;) ready to test your Puyo skills.<br><br>In addition to the traditional story mode, where a single player takes on 8 other characters in hopes of earning the medal, there is also the traditional battle mode, where up to 4 players (8 on the DS version) battle it out (by themselves or in teams) to the last.",
