  "description": "Those cute little monkey's rolling around in their bubble like balls have returned for their latest adventure, this time taking advantage of the Nintendo DS touch screen/stylus combo to provide a new level of control over your Super Monkey Ball!<br><br>As with the previous titles in the series, your aim is to guide your monkey across a number of different obstacle courses, reaching the goal before the time limit expires. You control not the monkey, but the play field itself, tilting it back and forth to dodge barriers and collect bananas.<br><br>Along with challenge, practice and replay modes, Touch and Roll allows for four players to compete against each other. You'll also be able to play in a set of bonus games, such as Monkey Mini-Golf, Monkey Fight and Monkey Bowling. Two new game modes, exclusive to the DS rendition, are Monkey Wars (a 1st person style shoot 'em up) and Monkey Air Hockey which, as the name suggests, is a Super Monkey Ball take on the arcade Air Hockey table top game.",
