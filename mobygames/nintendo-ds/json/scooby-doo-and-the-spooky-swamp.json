  "description": "Scooby and Shaggy are sniffing out food which leads them into a spooky swamp. They meet a resident, Lisa, who asks them to help find ingredients for her stew. Meanwhile they have to solve two mysteries with the Mystery Inc. gang while secretly gathering the ingredients. In this 3D action platformer, you can control 5 members of the gang, each of which have different skills and functions. A friend can also play in co-op at the same time. You can run, jump, fight enemies and solve puzzles. Keep your eye on your health bar which will decrease if hit by an enemy but will recover over time or when defeating enemies. <br><br>Along the way, there are collectible items to get such as Scooby's collar medallion, ingredients for a hoagie sandwich, blue ghost photographs, costumes, and letters to spell Scooby.  Awards are given for completing certain tasks.  In the Swamp's Clubhouse, you can view your collectibles, rewards, options and cheat codes.  Acquire small masks each time you defeat an enemy and when enough of a type are gained, you will get information on that enemy in the Clubhouse. <br><br>The other locations involved in mysteries are a Southwestern ghost town called El Muncho which is being plagued by El Scaryachi, and a snowy mountain peak called Howling Peaks where a Yeti is frightening away tourists.
