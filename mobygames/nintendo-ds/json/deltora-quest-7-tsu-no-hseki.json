  "description": "Long ago, there was an age of darkness. Seven tribes ruled over the lands known as Deltora. Each one of them possessed a jewel, said to represent one of humanity's virtues. However, their rule was thrown into a crisis by the Lord of Darkness and his many minions. Along came a hero, Adin, who had a dream of using the power of the jewels to defeat the dark forces. In order to do that, he crafted a belt that can contain all of the precious stones. Traveling far and wide across the lands, he managed to acquire all of the jewels and imbued them to the belt. With near limitless power of the empowered belt, Adin managed to drive out the army of the Lord of Darkness, restore peace to the lands of Deltora and unite it under a single kingdom.<br><br>Generations come and pass. The descendants of the legendary hero now continue the tradition of inheriting the belt as a sign of their sovereignty. However, dark forces inside the court conspire to subjugate the kingdom to the mighty Lord of Darkness once more. Will the newly crowned king manage to defeat the evil, or will someone else stand up to the quest?<br><br><i>Deltora Quest: 7-tsu no H?seki</i> (Deltora Quest: The Seven Jewels/Stones) is a RPG game based on the series of fantasy novels by Emily Rodda. The game follows the story of the books faithfully. Unlike many JRPG contemporaries, the game plays more like an action RPG; all of the combat is done in real time. The game is unique in that most of the actions for the game are done by extensively using the Nintendo DS touchscreen. Anything from attacking enemies to casting spells, almost all of the actions are done by using the stylus and the touch commands. Also, the game features a crafting system where players can upgrade weapons through a mini-game.",
