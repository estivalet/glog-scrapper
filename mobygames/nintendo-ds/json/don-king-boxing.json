  "description": "In <i>Don King Boxing</i> you play as a fictional young protege of Don King, aiming to take on on the greats in the ring. The game is a first-person boxing simulator on Nintendo DS that uses both the face controls and the touch controls with the stylus. Players look their opponents head-on as they tap and swipe on different parts of the screen to jab, hook, uppercut, block and dodge their way to victory or defeat. The plot is thin as the combat takes center stage.<br><br>The game features a long list of contemporary real-life boxers to fight in various venues, as well as including some &quot;classic fights&quot; with some of the best of all time including Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis, and Larry Holmes. Players can customize their boxer with an array of some basic physical options as well as take part in training modes to improve their fighter's stats. Multiplayer over two DS handhelds is also available.",
