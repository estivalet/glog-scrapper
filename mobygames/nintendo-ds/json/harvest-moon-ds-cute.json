You're a late-blooming farmer, \n      but the Harvest King doesn't have patience for girls who play all day! \n      That's why he weeded out the Harvest Goddess and the Harvest Sprites, \n      leaving you out standing in your fields. Break his spell by sowing seeds \n      and finding the Harvest Sprites. You'll need to master planting fields \n      and tending livestock. Perhaps a handsome bachelor will help you before \n      a mysterious thief steals your heart!\n    </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t <ul>\n      <li>\n        Raise Cows, Sheep, Chickens and Ducks!\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Plant and grow a variety of crops and trees!\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Court and marry local guys or invite over favorites from Harvest \n        Moon®: Friends of Mineral Town by inserting your copy of Harvest Moon: \n        Friends of Mineral Town or Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town!\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      \n    </p>\n    <p>\n       \n    </p>",
