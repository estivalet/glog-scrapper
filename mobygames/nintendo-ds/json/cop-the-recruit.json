  "description": "When the streetracer Dan Miles is arrested by Detective Brad Winter, he is given two choices: go into prison, or join the Criminal Overturn Programme (C.O.P.) that turns criminal into law servants. Obviously he takes the second option and becomes an Officer of the C.C.D (Central Control Department), the local police, to protect New York citizens against the scum of the city.<br><br>As Dan Miles starts investigating on a series of terrorist attacks with his new mentor Brad Winter, the latter is falsely arrested and hold in jail, stopping his investigations.<br><br>From now on, it will be up to Dan to seek after the truth, sometimes using the badge, sometimes his old underworld contacts as a former streetracer. He will have to deal with the gang of the Bomb Zombies, who seem to be up to a widespread attack on the city, with castrophic potential.<br><br>C.O.P. The Recruit is a sandbox game (GTA-like) in a 3D open-environment, recreating New York City over 6 square miles. As a new police officer, Dan can commandeer any car that he likes -and sometimes boats- and drive to any part of the city. He has to complete 60 missions over 20 hours as well as side missions that are optional, awards that work as achievements to unlock throughout the missions, and 150 hidden items to find in the vast city.<br><br>The gameplay is mainly third-person shooting (using the shoulder buttons to fire like in Metroid Prime) and driving, but not only. More creative missions also take advantage of the Nintendo DS microphone and touchscreen through commanding S.W.A.T. assaults, controlling security cameras of the city, or spying a conversation with a microphone.",
