  "description": "<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack</i> is a modern take on the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles__\">Turtles arcade game</a>. Just like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up\">TMNT: Smash-Up</a> on the Wii this game was also released to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary and likewise also uses the original black and white style comic panels to move the story forward.<br><br>Unlike Konami's Turtle beat 'em ups, <i>Arcade Attack</i> is in fact 3D while attempting to play as though it were 2D but with a slightly isometric camera angle. The game can be played alone with a CPU ally or with a friend wirelessly with a selection of the four turtles, each with their own varying stats. Also much like <i>Smash Up</i>, while the game tries to blend both the new and the old TMNT universe all into one it leans a lot more heavily toward the new with its visual style and enemy selection.",
