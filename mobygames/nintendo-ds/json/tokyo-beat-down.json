With an ever-growing threat of violence, crime, and \n      terrorism, these cops will do whatever it takes, inflict as much damage \n      as necessary to restore peace and security to the streets of Tokyo.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Beat 'em up that lets you shoot 'em up - When fisticuffs aren't \n        enough, add guns to deliver a whole new brand of justice to the mean \n        streets of Tokyo. Pick up a variety of weapons, ranging from handguns \n        to rocket launchers, for intense action on each level.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        70's cop shows have nothing on this - Outrageous style, over-the-top \n        substance, and no holds barred hardboiled police action mix with \n        madcap humor and sharply-written dialogue. Dishing out justice to the \n        seamy underbelly of Tokyo has never been this satisfying.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Multiple characters &amp; endings - This sordid tale of Tokyo's criminal \n        set unfolds through the eyes of three different cops with unique play \n        styles. Story branches lead to multiple endings that determine whether \n        you'll get your shot to beat down the ultimate crime boss.\n      </li>\n    </ul>",
