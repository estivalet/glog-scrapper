  "description": "In <i>MTV Fan Attack</i> players take on the role of an up and coming rock star named Ugo. However stardom has a cost, namely being constantly chased by enamored fans and aggressive paparazzi.<br><br>Ugo will have to run and jump to escape his fans throughout  over 28 missions. These missions take place  throughout the world in locales such as Paris, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. While the main game focuses on escaping fans, the game also has side mission mini-games.  The mini-games involve topics of what would be expected of a rock star, namely things such as destroying hotel rooms, seducing a fan, and throwing caught undergarments back into the audience.\n",
