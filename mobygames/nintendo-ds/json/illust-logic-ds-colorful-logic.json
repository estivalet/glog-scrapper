  "description": "While not carrying the official stamp of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Puzzle+Series+series\">Hudson's Puzzle Series</a>, this can be considered a follow up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/puzzle-series-vol-6-illust-logic\">Puzzle Series Vol. 6: Illust Logic</a>. Instead of only focusing on traditional picross puzzles, there is an addition of a color picross variant. This adds a new wrinkle to the puzzle solving as coloring in the boxes correctly has to be taken into consideration. A more robust version of this game was released for the Wii (oddly enough back in the Puzzle Series) titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/puzzle-series-vol-2-illust-logic-colorful-logic\">Puzzle Series Vol. 2: Illust Logic + Colorful Logic</a>.",
