  "description": "Know How 2 is a classic puzzle game and the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/know-how-think-and-play-outside-the-box\">Know How</a>. The objective of the game is to move a treasure chest off the game board an onto an exit square. Various stones block the way and have to be moved first, but they will only move lengthwise. Special obstacle stones further complicate the task. Know How 2 features all the obstacle types from the first game plus several new ones such as sliding ice blocks and snake blocks that can move and twist in all directions.  <br><br>The game contains 360 puzzles in different game modes. 'Adventure Mode' is a treasure hunt around the world. Unlike in the first game there is no real story this time. Instead, you solve puzzles on treasure maps in order to unlock 16 different historic treasures. The 'Free Play' mode is simply a linear sequence of puzzles. The Nintendo DS version of the game also contains a Multiplayer mode that allows you to test your speed-puzzling skills against a friend. Nintendo DSi owners can use the DSi camera to scan special QR codes that contain additional puzzles.",
