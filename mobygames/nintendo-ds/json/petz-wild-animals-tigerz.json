  "description": "Following the tradition of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/petz-series\">Petz series</a> for the PC, Ubisoft now brings the series to Nintendo DS. This is the second game in the branch called <i>Wild Animals</i> and it brings the player the opportunity to deal with tigers and other secondary circus animals.<br><br>In <i>Tigerz</i>, the player takes the role of Enzo and Ana, two young people belonging to a family of tamers who receive two young tigers  from their grandfather. In addition to the usual tasks in the series, that is, caring for the pets (feeding, bathing, healing, etc.). The main goal in <i>Tigerz</i> is to work with pets, through the usual mini-games, becoming a professional tamer. While doing this, the player has the opportunity to tour through the world and help other six tamers with their respective pets, from Britain to India, from a dog with a hat too big to a jumping elephant. All this taming around the world experience is done with elements of adventure and role-playing games. For instance, the player can level up as a tamer, while following a storyline narrated by the grandpa Antonio.",
