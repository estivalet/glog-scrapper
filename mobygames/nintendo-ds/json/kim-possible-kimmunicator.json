  "description": "The insane Dr. Drakken and his sidekick Shego have kidnapped Kim's techno-geek friend, Wade, and it's up to you to help her rescue him!  Kim goes undercover as she attempts to discover the location of Drakken's latest lair.  Encounter deadly foes such as the astoundingly cheap Frugal Lucre and the mad geneticist DNAmy as you make your way to Drakken's hideout.<br><br>Kim Possible: Kimmunicator is a fixed perspective 3D platformer, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/klonoa\">Klonoa</a>, except without the optional branching paths.  Players collect chips as they progress through the levels, which can then be used as currency to buy gadgets and weaponry to access secret areas.  Kim has access to her standard set of moves, such as backflips, double jumps, roundhouse kicks, and more, which she is able to use to defeat villains.<br><br>The game also features a couple of mini-games that make use of the unique features of the DS.  One of these is a parachuting level where you must blow into the microphone to make Kim briefly rise as you navigate through a narrow, lava-filled cavern.  The other is a hacking mini-game where you must trace a path to a particular circuit using the stylus without touching any other wires.",
