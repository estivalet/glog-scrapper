When they are all connected the level is cleared.</li>\n\t<li><i>Stack Jack</i> involves creating stacks by matching shapes of different sizes. The circles fall down and the player has to connect three items of the same shape to create a stack.</li>\n\t<li><i>Twist 'n' Turn</i> shows two wheels with gems and the player has to rotate the wheels on the lower screen so that the gems match the ones on the upper screen</li>\n\t<li><i>Flower Board</i> involves clearing flowers from a board.

It is possible to rotate the wheel to make the gems fit.</li>\n\t<li><i>Solitaire</i> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Peg+Solitaire\">Peg Solitaire</a> and involves clearing a board by hopping stones over other stones before reaching a goal with the last move.</li>\n</ul>",
