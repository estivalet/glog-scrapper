  "description": "Bub and Bob (from the arcade game <i>Bubble Bobble</i>) once again take the lead role in <i>Space Bust-A-Move</i>. Like in previous <i> Bust-a-Move</i> titles, the general goal of the game is to clear the screen of colored bubbles by making groups of three or more bubbles of the same color.\nThe game allows play in a variety of modes including Story, Versus, Endless, Challenge and Extra modes.<br><br>In Story Mode, Bub and Bob travel to various planets in search of the &quot;Cosmo Bubbles&quot;. Each planet consists of three levels, of 5 stages each, and a boss fight stage. In each of the levels there is one Como Bubble to find and collect.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Versus mode, the player must compete against various characters from the game. It ends either with &quot;Game Over&quot; or when all characters are defeated.</p>\n<p>\nEndless and Challenge modes consist of bursting as many bubble as possible, either until &quot;Game Over&quot; in Endless Mode, or in a set amount of time in Challenge Mode.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Extra Mode is made of many mini-games bought in the in-game shop.",
