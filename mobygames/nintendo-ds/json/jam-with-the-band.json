  "description": "<i>Daigasso! Band Brothers DX</i>  (Grand Ensemble! Band Brothers DX) is the third entry in the Daigasso! Band. Brothers series. This deluxe version features several new songs but more importantly it is capable of interacting with the Wii through a game-specific channel called the Speaker Channel in Japan. Daigasso! Band Brothers DX also allows the player to download new songs to the 8 megabyte capacity game cartridge via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.<br><br>Daigasso! Band Brothers gameplay remains unchanged. It is a music game in which the player can choose any instrument in a song, and then perform that instrument's role in the song. Your ability to perform will affect the outcome of the song, as your input corresponds with musical notes. To play your instrument you use the buttons on the DS. Beginner Mode only requires you to press either the D-Pad or a button, and will play harder sections of songs for you by touching the touch screen when shown. As you progress through the Amateur and Pro modes, you'll be using all eight face buttons/directions to play an entire octave, and shoulder buttons to modify the note, making it a sharp or an octave higher.\n",
