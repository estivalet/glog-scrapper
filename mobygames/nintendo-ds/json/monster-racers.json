  "description": "<i>Monster Racers</i> is a monster capture role-playing and racing game. About ten years ago strange monsters were discovered on an island in the Pacific ocean. These strange monsters liked to race each other and soon spread across the globe. Humans soon started befriending these monsters and race one another.<br><br>In the game the player starts out as a new monster tamer, first passing a trial to get a license. The game plays from a bird's-eye perspective. Monsters can level up through winning races. A race take place in a side view perspective. During the race the player has to beat the opponent by jumping over gaps and finishing first. A turbo can be used to accelerate for a short period of time. If the player encounters a wild monster he can also choose to befriend/capture it. This is done by shooting stars at it to weaken it. The player can carry a maximum of three monster at one time. Additional captured monster are sent to a 'monsterium' holding place and can be equipped there. Monster have strengths and weaknesses for example some run better on grass and other perform better on sand or running through fire.",
