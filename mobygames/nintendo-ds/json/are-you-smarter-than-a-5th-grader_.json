  "description": "<i>Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?</i> is based off the Fox TV game show of the same name and features the voice and CGI likeness of its host, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,313882/\">Jeff Foxworthy</a>.<br><br>The set-up is the same as the shows, where there are 10 questions ranging from $1,000 to $1,000,000 and consists of grade school subjects such as grammar, animal science, astronomy, among many other subjects. The game board is divided with grades one through five listed with two questions a piece, which is randomized after each game. The player can also choose which grade and subject to answer at any time.<br><br>At the beginning of the game they choose one from five different classmates (Amanda, Cynthia, Joseph, Edward, and Logan), each with their own subject specialties and changes a student after two questions. They can use these classmates to either &quot;copy&quot; (which lets the player use the answer of their classmate) and &quot;peek&quot; (which lets the player take a look at their classmates answer and help them decide). There is also a &quot;save&quot; cheat that saves the player in case both they and their classmate both get a question wrong. Also, a player can &quot;drop out&quot; at anytime and end the game with the money they have won.<br><br>The first nine questions are given to the player in the form of multiple choice, however the final $1,000,000 question requires the player to manual spell out the answer. Additionally, a player can not use a &quot;cheat&quot; or &quot;drop out&quot;, once they choose to answer the question, they must answer it. While the game's rules are identical to those of the TV show, one main difference is that their is no time limit, giving the player an ample opportunity to &quot;cheat&quot; in their own way.",
