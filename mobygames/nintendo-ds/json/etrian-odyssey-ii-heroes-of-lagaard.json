  "description": "<i>Etrian Odyssey II: Heroes of Lagaard</i> is a role-playing game from Atlus, it is a dungeon crawler similar to the first that starts in the nation of Lagaard. In the game players once again have to face the dangers of the Yggdrasil Labyrinth in turn-based combat while they map their way through each floor, this time to make their way to the top and retrieve the Grail of Kings. <br><br>All nine classes from the first game have returned and three new classes have been introduced, with most classes being unlocked from the start. Improvements made to the mapping system make them more accessible to the player including new icons for a total of 21. The interface has seen some improvements so that players can now see how a piece of equipment will affect their character before they purchase it. Items can also be stored now, for a price. ",
