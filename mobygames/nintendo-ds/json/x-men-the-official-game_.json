It is a top-down action game with 3D characters consisting of forty levels. In some of them, the player switches between Wolverine, Iceman and Magneto on the fly; in others, (s)he plays as Nightcrawler with no switching.  Character movement is done via the Control Pad. All other character actions are performed using the touch screen. Gameplay takes places on the lower screen with character status on the upper.<br><br>Nightcrawler teleports, Wolverine attacks ground-based enemies, Iceman shoots ice attacks, and Magneto picks up metallic objects and throws them; he can also break metal doors.  Enemies are vulnerable to some attacks but immune to others, so the player must frequently swap characters to defeat them.  In addition to the cannon-fodder enemies, many levels have boss characters.",
