  "description": "Dogz 2 is the sequel to the Nintendo DS <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dogz\">Dogz</a>, a title of the Nintendo DS <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/petz-series\">Petz series</a>.<br><br>Differently to the traditional pet games, the focus of Dogz 2 is in the 18 mini-games, seven of which are card games that can be played in multiplayer, like blackjack and memory games, which will give the player goodies, like furniture and toys and costumes for the dogs and even more rooms of the house, after completed or won.  There are 11 different breeds (like dalmatian, beagle or poodle) to choose from this time and 250 different items to fill the house with.<br><br>There is no pet caring in Dogz 2, but there is still plenty of interaction with them. Many of the collectibles may produce a reaction on the dogs. The player can also make his/her puppies to wear costumes and even give them 14 different oral orders through the microphone of the DS.",
