  "description": "<i>Unknown Soldier: Mokuba no H?k?</i> is a third person shooter set in the second World War. You're an unnamed soldier from one of the four platoons acting out a secret plan to shift the victory towards the Allied forces, called &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot;.<br><br>The game is played from a third person perspective where you control the unnamed soldier through three dimensional war-torn cities and landscapes. The game prominently features a lock-on cover mechanic where the player character can take cover behind vehicles and other objects found in the levels. The player can arm themselves with multiple pistols, rifles and armaments like grenades to clear each level in this mission-based single player campaign. There are also a variety of vehicle sections where the player can control tanks.<br><br>The game features multiple game modes, such as the two solo modes of the main campaign and quick play, as well as a wireless multi-cart multiplayer mode between two players. There are also extensive records for collectors, including game completion rates, lists of weapons and items found as well as medals the player can be awarded with in the main campaign.",
