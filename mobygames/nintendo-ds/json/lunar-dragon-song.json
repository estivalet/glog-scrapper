  "description": "<i>Dragon Song</i> is an installment in the long-running Japanese role-playing series <i>Lunar</i>. <br><br>Delivery boy Jian Campbell gets caught up in a quest to save the world, after a monster fighting expedition with his friend Lucia becomes more dangerous than they had expected. The quest revolves around the four dragons who were sent by the goddess Athena, who protect the world she created.<br><br>The game continues several <i>Lunar</i> traditions, including the use of very young heroes and heroines, and of course its anime graphical style.<br><br>Game mechanics rely heavily on the DS touch screen, as well as the top screen being able to display stats and menus. Combat in the game owes more to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Final+Fantasy+series\">Final Fantasy</a> than previous <i>Lunar</i> games, with characters staying still and attacking whichever opponent is closest, or most vulnerable to their attacks (the player does not choose).<br><br>Other inclusions are that players either receive items or experience, not both; currency is earned by the sale of items.",
