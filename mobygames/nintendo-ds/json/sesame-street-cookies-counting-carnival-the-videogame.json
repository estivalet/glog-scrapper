  "description": "In <i>Cookie's Counting Carnival</i>, kids head to the Carnival with Cookie Monster and Big Bird to learn about numbers, counting, colors and pattern recognition by playing educational mini-games. These mini-games are accessed by taking a tour of the amusement park and visiting its various attractions, such as The Grandstand, Rides, Midway, Food Court, Petting Zoo, and so on. Alternatively, a separate mode allows to directly select and play the desired mini-game, without going through the entire carnival.",
