  "description": "<i>Pogo Island</i> is a compilation that includes enhanced versions of five Pogo.com games:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/word-whomp\">Word Whomp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/poppit\">Poppit!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/phlinx\">Phlinx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/squelchies\">Squelchies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tri-peaks-solitaire\">Tri-Peaks Solitaire</a></li>\n</ul>\nThe changes are mostly cosmetic: there are new backgrounds, music and special effects. One notable addition is the island adventure story mode featuring the Pogo mascots tied to the five games. Lead by Perry the Parrot Captain they travel around an archipelago, from island to island, randomly triggering the main games or micro games related to repairing the boat, such as sorting out nuts and bolts. <br><br>The tokens earned in-game can be transferred to the player's online account on Pogo.com. The game includes a multiplayer hot seat mode, while <i>Word Whomp</i> can be played competitively from two different devices.",
