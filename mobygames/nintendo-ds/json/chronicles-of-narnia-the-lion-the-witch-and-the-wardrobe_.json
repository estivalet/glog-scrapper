  "description": "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe for the Nintendo DS is an action adventure/RPG based on the film and classic C.S. Lewis novel by the same name.<br><br>Players take on the role of the Pevensie children and step through a magical wardrobe in the frozen land of Narnia. Jadis, an evil witch, has covered the land in eternal ice and snow, and the children are destined to save it with the help of talking animals, magical creatures, and a lordly lion named Aslan.<br><br>The Nintendo DS version of the game combines hack-and-slash action with RPG elements. It's very open-ended; you can walk through the land, encounter creatures, and perform over 60 subquests. Each subquest will award your character a special skill, ranging from attack moves, to summoning songs (played on pan-pipes on the touchscreen), and cordial magic (activated by drawing symbols on the touchscreen).<br><br>Additionally, your characters will earn experience which lets you increase their virtues, such as courage, magnificence, gentleness, and justice, each of which has an effect on the character's abilities. Over the course of the game, your characters will grow more powerful, you'll see winter give way to spring, and will finally get to battle Jadis' more powerful minions, such as giants, minotaurs, goblins, and boggles.<br><br>The game also supports wireless cooperative multiplayer, so you can experience the entire adventure with your friends.",
