  "description": "The basic gameplay principle of <i>Bomberman Land Touch! 2</i> is identical to its predecessor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bomberman-land-touch\">Bomberman Land Touch!</a>: the player moves through a hub world (this time the Bom-Bom Kingdom) and starts one of the available mini games with a theme park background. Solving these rewards items which unlock more parts of the world with additional mini games (overall 40).  Some of the mini games are new while others re-use concepts introduced in the predecessor.  The plot follows Cheerful White, a Bomberman, as he explores the Bom-Bom Kingdom theme park.<br><br>The multiplayer mode (the traditional <i>Bomberman</i> principle in which multiple characters move over a overhead map, use bombs in order to kill the competition and collect power-ups) is also largely identical with a few additional maps and items as well as single-cart support. The solo content is controlled with touch and stylus while the multiplayer part uses the digipad.",
