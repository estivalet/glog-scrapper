  "description": "In the prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/undercover-operation-wintersun\">Undercover: Operation Wintersun</a> the events are set in 1938. The smell of World War II is strong and espionage is frequent in Europe. Scientist John Russell is working in a British secret research laboratory, but suddenly he is accused of providing the Germans with secret research materials. With a merry and faithful Audrey, secretary of the research institute's director, he only has 24 hours to find the actual spy and to prove his innocence before it is too late! <br><br>There are two playable characters, Russell and Audrey. Players can select and switch between them on both screens of the DS at any time, directing them in 3rd-person view via the touchscreen and stylus. The 1st-person view is used to solve the logical puzzles and compete in 10 mini-games including darts, boxing, and more. It can also be applied to make use of the individual abilities of the characters to perform an investigation.",
