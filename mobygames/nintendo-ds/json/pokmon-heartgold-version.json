  "description": "<i>Pokémon HeartGold</i> is an enhanced remake of one of the second installments in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Pok%c3%a9mon+Main+RPG+Series\">Pokémon Main RPG Series</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-gold-version\">Pokémon Gold</a>.<br><br>Set in the region of Johto, the player controls a new Pokémon Trainer on his/her way to meet up with Pokémon Researcher Professor Elm at his lab to receive his/her first Pokémon. While running an errand for Elm, the player returns to find that a thief has stolen one of the professor's Pokémon. This event starts your quest to becoming a Pokémon master, leading you through the region of Johto and later Kanto, to battle the mysterious Team Rocket and capture all 493 Pokémon. <br><br>Along with retaining most of the original game's features, <i>HeartGold</i> contains quite a few new updates. Like <i>Gold</i> the story will incorporate the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh (who can be seen on the game's box art), although this time in a bigger fashion. Graphics have been upgraded to 3D models to resemble the series previous Nintendo DS iterations, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-diamond-version\">Diamond</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-pearl-version\">Pearl</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-platinum-version\">Platinum</a>. The ability to have any one of your Pokémon following you on the Overworld Screen which was limitedly seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition\">Pokémon Yellow</a> has been added. <br><br>Included with the game is a peripheral known as the Pokéwalker. Acting as a pedometer, the Pokéwalker allows you to wirelessly transfer a Pokémon from <i>HeartGold</i> to it. When there is a Pokémon in the Pokéwalker it gains &quot;experience points&quot; for each step you take. The player also earns a form of money known as &quot;watts&quot;, which is used to help catch other Pokémon and buy items.<br><br>The game is compatible with the following games via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Pokémon <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-soulsilver-version\">SoulSilver</a>, <i>Diamond</i>, <i>Pearl</i>, and <i>Platinum</i>.",
