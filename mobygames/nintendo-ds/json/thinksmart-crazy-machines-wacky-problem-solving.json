  "description": "Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=The+Incredible+Machine\">The Incredible Machine</a> the player needs to use animated parts to assemble a Rube Goldberg-type contraption and solve puzzles by doing so.<br><br>The game features three different modes: Classic, Arcade or Construction Kit. The classic mode requires the player to place the parts and manually activate the machine to get the ball to it's goal, the arcade mode confronts the player with an already finished and running machine which needs a little help. By using the stylus or blowing into the microphone the player not only moves the ball through the experiment but also activates and uses the parts of the machine. By successfully completing all those puzzles, the player unlocks additional components which are then at his disposal in the construction kit to freely construct anything he wants without a time or space limit.<br><br>Although the game doesn't feature a traditional multiplayer-mode, the players can trade their experiments with friends over the wireless connection.",
