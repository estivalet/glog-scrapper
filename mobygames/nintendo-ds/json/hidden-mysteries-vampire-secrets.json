  "description": "Claire Donnelly is constantly assaulted with bizarre visions of a distant and unknown place. She takes some time off from the pressures of the corporate world to enjoy a vacation in the house of a relative in Savannah, Georgia. After arriving, she finds a note by aunt Rosie explaining that she had to leave town for a few days, leaving the house on Claire's care. After exploring the vacant rooms, she starts to piece together several clues that lead to different city locations, slowly revealing details about an evil force threatening all the citizens.<br><br><i>Hidden Mysteries: Vampire Secrets</i> is a hidden object game with standard features from point-and-click adventure titles, where the main objective is to gather a series of items to solve all the puzzles on the available locations. Most of the necessary tools are received after completing one of the hidden object challenges, where all the objects from a list at the bottom of the screen have to be found on scenes filled with assorted paraphernalia scattered around the scenery. The hint button is a crucifix at the bottom-right corner, that shows the position of one of the required items when activated, but takes some time to recharge after use.<br><br>The items are stored inside the inventory tray at the bottom, from where they have to be dragged and dropped on interactive portions of the screen to perform an action or complete a task. Books with plot details and clues are stored in a separate tab, containing information necessary to solve some of the puzzles. Mini-games take place on separate screens, where mechanisms have to be manipulated directly to play a game of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/simon\">Simon</a> with the symbols engraved on a diary cover, arrange tarot cards by color on a fortune teller's table, unscramble a stained glass picture and complete other similar challenges. They can be optionally skipped after a few minutes.",
