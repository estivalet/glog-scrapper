  "description": "<i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</i> for the Nintendo DS features a mix of management, driving and tactics, all presented in a top-down view. From the Ghostbusters' headquarters, the player chooses from a list of missions posted on a board, equips each character with weapons and items, and then drives Ecto-1 to the destination.<br><br>A single character can be controlled at a time - the other characters either follow the player or stand guard. The mission is over when the goal has been completed (ghost captured, object collected, etc.) or when all the characters have been knocked out. With the money earned from the mission, the player can repair Ecto-1, buy new equipment or develop character attributes.",
