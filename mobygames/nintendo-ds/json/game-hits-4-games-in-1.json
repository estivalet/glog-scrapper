Game Hits contains 4 all-time great classic games, updated with a modern twist. All four games are 3D in design  and just as addictive as ever.  Eat your way through a maze in <b>Maze Munchers</b>, shoot down spaceships in <b>Space Ship</b>,  fill rows with the right blocks in <b>Falling Bricks</b>, and help a robot  across a ravine safely in <b>Highway Hopper</b>. Play as many levels as possible and set new high scores. You can also team up with a friend or battle against each other. The various difficultly levels make  Game Hits equally challenging for both young and old.",
