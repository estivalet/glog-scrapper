  "description": "<i>Little Bears</i> is a bear simulation for the Nintendo DS. The player has the choice between polar, brown and black bears and has to care for his virtual pet. The personality development of the bear baby depends on the intensity of the player in looking after his pet. Next to the basic needs like sleeping, eating and drinking, the bear babies' wants and needs include stroking, playing, bathing and dental care. In the beginning the bear is shy, but after a while it is possible to develop a relationship and get an active playmate. The integrated bear calendar shows the changing seasons and time.",
