  "description": "<i>Virtual Villagers: Erschaffe dein Paradies!</i> is a single player village management simulator. It is a DS adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Virtual+Villagers+series\">Virtual Villagers series</a> and it was made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Keen+Games\">Keen Games</a>, a German development studio, based on a license from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Big+Fish+Games\">Big Fish Games</a>.<br><br>The game starts with a few survivors of a tribe who are stranded on an island, in a lagoon. During the course of the game they will expand to two more locations, a smaller island of volcanic origin, and the jungle behind the lagoon. The player has to teach the people the basics of survival, train them in different skills and help them develop their technologies. In order to do so, there are many mini-games to play to gain more skills. When the mini-games are ignored, the skill grows at normal pace.<br><br>During the game, the player gains the ability to customize the villagers, color their clothes and dye their hair if he likes. He can name them and personalize them further by adorning their clothes or hair with flowers or feathers he finds. There are ancient ruins to be discovered and mysteries (called puzzles) and these are solved using the skill and technologies from the villagers.<br><br>Many events happen, where the player has to influence the course of the island life. For example: is the stranded whale to be rescued or to be eaten? Should the villagers chase away the monkeys? \n<i>Virtual Villagers</i> is about watching and guiding the villagers on their island in their daily struggle to survive. ",
