  "description": "This handheld version is different from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Juiced+2%3a+Hot+Import+Nights\">cousins</a>.  It still has the same setup, racing or drifting in a variety of tracks.  It features a dozen 3-D licensed cars, ranging Scion, Infiniti, Lotus, and Mitsubishi and the same locations from the other versions.<br><br>There is a career mode, split into ten different leagues, the player having to win one to advance to the next as well as exhibition races, drifting competitions, elimination races (where the last car to cross the finish line per lap is eliminated from the race).<br><br>The gameplay consists of using the D-pad to maneuver around course, but the stylus is used by the player to personally created logos that can be placed on the car and edit paint schemes as well.",
