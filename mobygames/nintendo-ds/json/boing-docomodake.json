  "description": "<i>Boing! Docomodake</i> is platformer starring Docomodake, the mascot of the Japanese mobile phone provider NTT DoCoMo. The background story is that Docomodake sets out to rescue various family members in dire situations, e.g. grandmother drifts down a river.<br><br>Docomodake moves through side-scrolling levels by jumping over gaps and dodging enemies. He has the ability to split up into a number of small mushrooms (called minis) which are individually controlled with the Stylus. To progress in the levels, the player needs to solve puzzles, e.g. switch puzzles or making mushroom-ladders, by using the minis. The minis are not bound to platforms, i.e. can be dragged anywhere on the screen, but are still subject to collision detection and harm: when they are hurt, the player has ten seconds to unite them with their father. When this fails, breathing into the microphone wakes them up again. Throwing minis can be also used to get rid of enemies. Collectibles are treasure chests (reward more minis which are required to progress in later levels) and coins (unlock extra content like art or music).",
