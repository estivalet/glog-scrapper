  "description": "This version of <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> is a side-scrolling action game. The premise is the same as in the other versions, although the plot itself is a bit altered to fit the platform's limitations. Oscorp researched the virus which caused Connors to turn into Lizard, but the cross-bread creatures escape into New York City. Now Spider-Man has to save the day while fighting Oscorp's robots which are out to destroy said creatures including Spider-Man himself. The story is told in comic-style cutscenes.<br><br>The game features an open city to swing through, but it has none of the usual open world distractions; it just serves as gateway to the next plot point. Those locations are interior levels in which Spider-Man has to fight enemies and the occasional boss in order to progress. Fighting is the usual beat 'em-up style: punching enemies a lot while dodging their attacks. Successful combos - hitting a lot without getting hit - fills a energy bar; as soon as it is full Spider-Man can unleash one of the special attack he picks up during the game. For example, the first is the web rush which hurts all enemies on screen. Spider-Man can collect power-ups which give advantages like additional damage for a limited amount of times.<br><br>The action takes place on the DS' lower screen while the upper screen is reserved for the map (detailed in the open world, reduced inside the levels). Touch is only used for menu screens.",
