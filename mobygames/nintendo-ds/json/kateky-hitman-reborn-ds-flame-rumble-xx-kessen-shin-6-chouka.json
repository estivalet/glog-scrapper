  "description": "<i>Kateky? Hitman Reborn! DS Flame Rumble XX – Kessen! Shin 6 Chouka</i> is a 2-D fighting game for the Nintendo DS.<br><br>Based on the popular anime series (in which a young boy named Tsunayoshi Sawada finds out that he is next in line to become the boss of the most powerful Mafia family, the Vongola, and is to be tutored by Reborn, an infant who happens to be Vongola’s best hitman), the game is the latest in the Flame Rumble series of DS games.<br><br>It features all the playable characters from the previous incarnations of the game, plus many new additions (like the infamous Real Funeral Wreaths from the show), updating the total to a huge roster of 100 characters (of which 51 are directly controllable and 49 are support characters). Having all these characters available provides an enormous amount of special attacks/combos that can be performed using all the possible combinations.<br><br>The game presents the player with several battle modes:\n<ul>\n<li> A story mode, where one main character (with possible support characters added in) is picked, with every storyline being different, allowing the player to convey the story through different POVs;\n<li> A classic arcade mode, where there are 10 fixed opponents to battle;\n<li> The Family battle mode, which allows the player to create his/her own Family and defeat 100 other Families in order to gain the World’s Strongest title (with battles getting harder up the ladder);\n<li> Free battle mode, which is pretty self-explanatory, you simply pick the characters/stage you want;\n<li> The new Choice battle mode, which follows the rules of the Choice game as stated in the manga/anime series, where two opposing teams are formed according to a spinning roulette.\n</ul>\nThere is also the possibility of Wifi battles, since this is a DSi-enhanced game (which makes it region-locked to Japan on the DSi, though region-free using other DS models).",
