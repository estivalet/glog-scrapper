  "description": "<i>Rhythm 'n Notes</i> presents a variety of lessons aimed at teaching or reinforcing several core music skills; namely recognizing notes and time signatures. The first focuses on an on screen piano that will play a note or a cord which the player must then replicate, the game demands perfection though, so it may take a while to pass. The other aspect of the training is played out by the player tapping a beat out on a percussion instrument, i.e. a soda can or a taiko.<br><br>Lessons are followed by identical tests to see what you managed to retain in your mind and ear.<br><br>The game is hosted by a bouncy animé, Tsunami, who will play along with you on the instruments and offer encouragement.
