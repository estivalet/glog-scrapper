  "description": "<i>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games</i> is an official game based on the Winter Olympics in Vancouver 2010. As in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mario+%26+Sonic+at+the+Olympic+Games\">predecessor</a> there are 20 characters from the two franchises which compete in 15 Olympic disciplines. In addition to that there are also some dream events which add a fantastic element to a known sport, e.g.ski-jumping with rockets. Every of those disciplines are played with an mini game which require different actions from the player, e.g. pressing buttons in the right rhythm for ice skating or steering during the snowboard event.  Some use the touch screen while others rely on traditional controls.<br><br>The DS-exclusive adventure mode features a story in which Dr. Eggman and Bowser melt away all the ice needed for the Olympic Games. To set things right Mario &amp; Sonic need to travel to different locations, talk to the inhabitants and solve challenges. Those consist of the sports mini games with certain winning requirements. Playing this mode also unlocks the dream events. Besides this players can decide to enter the party game mode or to play the games separately respectively in a custom tournament. All modes except the adventure mode are also available for up to four players.",
