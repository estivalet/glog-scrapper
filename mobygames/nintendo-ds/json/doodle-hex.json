  "description": "<i>Doodle Hex</i> is a fast-paced puzzle fighter for the Nintendo DS. Play the role of a student wizard at the College of Runes and battle other students to see who is the best, fighting teachers and then ultimately fight a secret boss. Players use the stylus to draw shapes 'magical runes' on the DS touch screen, which then travel towards your opponent on the other side of the playing area. In the playing area is a circular drawing board on which you draw runes that activate your spells, assuming there is currently enough mana to do so. Once cast, a little icon starts moving anti-clockwise around the board, up towards an image of the opponent (at the 12 o'clock position). If it hits your opponent the effects of the spell are manifested, whether it's simply inflicting damage, cursing them with effects. <br><br>Both players players have a shield which can be activated by pressing their own icon (at the six o'clock position). The shield only last few a few seconds before needing to recharge and some spells are able to cut through it, so players need to keep an eye on not only which spells are traveling towards them, but how their spells are likely to be received by their opponent. Tactics are used to combine these runes both in timing and effect.",
