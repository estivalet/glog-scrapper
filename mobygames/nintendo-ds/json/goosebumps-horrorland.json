As you fiendishly try to \n      escape the park, you will unravel a mystery, encounter a host of creepy \n      horrors, monsters and mummies plus trademark Goosebumps twists and \n      cliffhangers. Goosebumps HorrorLand offers suspense, tension, humor, and \n      pulse-pounding action.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        five terror inducing and unique park areas\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        play in story mode or arcade mode\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        30 bone chilling rides and attractions\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        multi-player features\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        collectible monster cards\n      </li>\n    </ul>",
