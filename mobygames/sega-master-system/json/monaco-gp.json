  "description": "A top-down view, vertically scrolling, Formula One-style racing game, with colour, first released for the arcade in 1979. Few games before this had coloured scrolling backgrounds (Taito's <i>Super Speed Race</i> is one). Has notable sound effects e.g the fanfare to start the race, engines, crashes, etcetera. The track has a narrowing/widening visual effect and a night driving mode where the headlines of cars are on.",
