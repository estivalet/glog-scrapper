  "description": "<i>Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars</i> has similar gameplay like in the other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Alex+Kidd\">Alex Kidd</a> games, but this one's easier and designed for kids. Once again you play Alex, whose mission is to run through each location, knocking down enemies, and obtain the six miracle balls. These balls are hidden inside the strangest places like golden eggs, the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/fantasy-zone\">Fantasy Zone</a> ship out of action, clamshells, Christmas presents, pumpkins, and desk bells.<br><br>Alex must then venture in outer space to defeat the evil Ziggurat. Locations include Toy World, Machine World, the World of Make Believe, Water World, and Monster World. You will even tour through the giant's body. Once you obtained the six miracle balls, you have to run through all the locations again, but these repeated locations introduce new enemies. <br><br>With all the locations, you're under a time limit, and as usual, if the time expires, you lose a life. Alex starts the game with nothing, but during the game, he can collect power-ups that give him extra time, and allow him to shoot enemies or jump higher.",
