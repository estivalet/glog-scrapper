  "description": "<i>Digger Chan</i> is a puzzle game where you play the eponymous character, an employee of the M.O.O. Milk Co., who is responsible for fixing the milk pipeline underground all over the world. The goal of the game is thus to dig a tunnel down to the pipeline in each level.<br><br>The levels are basically a pattern of coloured blocks which Digger must shovel away. He can dig away the block either right below or above him, or to the left or to the right. All blocks of the same colour which are either vertically or horizontally adjacent to the disappearing block will vanish also. As the levels progress, blocks will appear in more different colours, thus slowing things down. As there is a time limit given by draining milk meter (which can be refilled by finding bottle of milk), some methodical proceeding is required. Also, Digger can climb up only a height of one block, so falling down several blocks deep might trap him, as there are also blocks of steel or pipes which cannot be dug away. Further difficulty is added by randomly placed TNT, which will explode shortly after being dug out and destroy everything within a one block radius.",
