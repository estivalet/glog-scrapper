  "description": "This edition of the classic driving game takes <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/outrun\">the original</a> and adds a 3D view, using the Master System's 3D glasses. Little else is modified. You still drive a red Ferrari on a road which forks into more and more levels. The main differences are the levels, which look slightly different, the fact that your Ferrari is slightly smaller than the original Master System conversion, and that there are three new sound tracks to choose from; <i>Midnight Highway, Color Ocean</i> and <i>Shining Wind.</i> The original <i>Magical Sound Shower</i> is still left for the traditionalists. There is also a significantly better graphics and the Beach was restored to the first stage and sluggish Rock Tunnel stage (whose graphics made crippling demands on almost all the home gaming platforms) was replaced by a dark road tunnel instead.",
