  "description": "The original future sport game, <i>Speedball</i> is played out on a small court with five players on each team, making it more frantic than <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Speedball+II\">the more famous sequel</a>. The ball must be thrown into the goal at your opponent's end. Any amount of physical contact can be made, and there are no illegal ways to get the ball or the goal.<br><br>Before each match you can bribe the referee into awarding you a head-start or strengthening the abilities of your players. You compete in a simple knockout cup tournament, or in individual 2-player games.",
