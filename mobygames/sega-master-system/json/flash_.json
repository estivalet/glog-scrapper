  "description": "<i>The Flash</i> is a side-scrolling platformer starring the eponymous D.C. comics hero. The game is divided into six rounds, each round has two stages and a boss fight. Within each stage, Flash must get to the exit before the time limit runs out, though the exit must first be unlocked by activating a switch.<br><br>Apart from a speedy protagonist, the game has some similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, as the levels have a similarly complex structure with different passages and many optional areas.<br><br>While Flash moves very fast in general, he can also move with even higher SuperSpeed, but only as long as the necessary SuperSpeed energy is not drained. The energy is also used for performing vibrating attacks and can be recharged by at Star Food vendors scattered in the levels. Vibrating attacks can be used to destroy blocks (which contain either traps or power-ups) and to get rid of bad guys. For the latter, Flash also has a spin attack. He can use it only while moving, but no energy is required.",
