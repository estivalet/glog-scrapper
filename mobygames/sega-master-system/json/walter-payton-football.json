  "description": "<i>Walter Payton Football</i>, or <i>American Pro Football</i>, as it is called in Japan and Europe, is a simulation of American football. There are two modes in the game. One is called &quot;Monday Night Game&quot; and is the same as a friendly game or exhibition mode; the other is &quot;Road to Superbowl&quot;, and is basically a play-off tournament in the NFL.<br><br>The player can choose his favorite NFL team to compete against the computer or another player. The game allows you to assign basic strategies to the teams, both in defensive and offensive plays. The game is viewed from a top-down perspective, with the exception of kick offs and field goals, which are viewed up close from a third person perspective, and allow the player to regulate the strength of the kick.",
