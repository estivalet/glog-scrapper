  "description": "The Kingpin is framing Spider-Man for planting a bomb in New York City. Spider-Man only has 24 hours to find the keys that will let him disarm the bomb and clear his name.<br><br>The game consists of eleven stages including boss fights and bomb defusal. The game has a counter that continually counts down until the bomb will explode. After the second stage, Spider-Man is given the option to exit a stage at anytime to return home and recover his health, but doing so will cost him precious time and he will have to restart the stage from the beginning again.\nSpider-Man must search through each stage thoroughly as the boss of the stage will only appear when all the humanoid enemies are defeated.<br><br>Spider-man can punch, kick, jump, and can also fire a webshot that will temporarily stun enemies. Spider-Man can also climb walls and use his webs to swing. \nSpider-Man can only use his web powers as long as his web cartridges are not empty. Spider-Man can refill his web cartridges by taking photos of the supervillains he comes across and selling the photos to the Daily Bugle newspaper.<br><br>The game has four difficulty levels with the hardest difficulty level Nightmare featuring random attacks from Venom.<br><br>A same titled game came out for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=010086010169\">Genesis</a> that features a similar story and general level progression, but the design of the levels are different.",
