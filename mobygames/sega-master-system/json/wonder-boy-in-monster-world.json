  "description": "Monster World was once a peaceful region. Then, the peace was shattered by an invading army of monsters. A young man named Shion vowed to defeat them and make his land peaceful again.<br><br><i>Wonder Boy In Monster World</i> is the third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Monster+World\">Monster World</a> spin-off series, originally known as <i>Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3</i>. It puts the player in control of Shion in his quest to save Monster World from the evil hands of BioMeka. It controls like a standard platform game - run, jump, and kill enemies. The game has light RPG elements such as talking to townsfolk, collecting money to buy items, upgrading your life, and equipping a variety of armor and weapons - staying very close to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=zelda\">Zelda</a> format. You can save your game to continue your quest at a later time.<br><br> ",
