  "description": "SEGA's 8-bit console came with built-in games in several of its releases. In three of them a hidden game (never released separated) called <i>Snail Maze</i> could be found. It was accessible by pressing together 1, 2 and up during the SEGA logo screen. The only Sega Master System versions which featured it were the original one (with no built in game), the one with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Hang+On\">Hang On</a> built in and the one with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Hang-On+%26+Safari+Hunt\">Hang-On & Safari Hunt</a> built in.<br><br>The gameplay consists of guiding an orange snail with a yellow shell through a blue maze. The goal is marked with an arrow and there's a time limit to get to it. As the levels progress, the time limit is reduced.",
