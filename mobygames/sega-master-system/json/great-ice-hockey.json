The team that ends up with the most goals as regulation time runs out wins.</p>\n<p>The game plays as a regular hockey match. Two difficulty settings (junior and senior) are an option for amateur or more skilled players. The player is assigned the US hockey team and then can choose from a number of other opponents from various countries.</p>",
