  "description": "<i>Slap Shot</i> is an ice hockey game with 24 national teams. They are divided into three pools with different skill levels and in single-player only matches between teams from the same pool can be played. The available playing options are exhibition matches or a tournament. Regarding gameplay, the player either controls the athlete with the puck  or one from the defense (including the goalkeeper) and one button is used for passing and another for shooting. From time to time two athletes get in a fist fight and the loser has to visit the penalty box. Overall the graphics and gameplay are similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/blades-of-steel\">Blades of Steel</a>.",
