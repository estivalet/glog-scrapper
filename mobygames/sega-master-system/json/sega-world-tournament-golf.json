  "description": "<i>Sega World Tournament Golf</i> is a golf game for one to four players. Players can select the competition format (Medal, Matchplay, Foursome, Fourball, Skins, Championship, depending of the number of players), course (Country Club or Links Golf Club) and number of holes (18, 36, 54, 72). Players can customize a series of features for their characters. The player can edit names, change player tee (front, middle or back), rearrange the 14 clubs, and select a player level (novice, amateur or pro).<br><br>The game is viewed from a top-down perspective. The speed and direction of the wind is shown on the top-left corner of the screen. Two small windows at the bottom of the screen show the player character and the field in front of the player. As the player changes the direction of the shot, new terrain is shown in the lower window. The ball trajectory is also shown in this lower window, and changing clubs show the different trajectories the ball will take. To shoot, players have to hold the button 2 to set the power and then release it in the right moment, as shown by two meters in the lower window. A map of the course can be seen by pressing the button 1.",
