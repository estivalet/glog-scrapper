  "description": "This version of <i>Great Soccer</i> is on the SEGA card. The other version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/great-soccer\">Great Soccer</a> is on the SEGA cartridge and an entirely different game.<br><br>This top-down perspective soccer game is just like a regular soccer match. Offsides, corner kicks and many other rulings make the game authentic. Whether on offense or defense, the player must gain control of the ball and score as often as possible. The team that ends up with the most goals at the end of regulation time wins.",
