After the passing of many centuries, Proco Jr. and Tiat Young receive a strange radio broadcast from the galaxy. They discover the radio broadcast is a mayday signal from another descendant of Darius. They board the Silverhawk, preparing to defeat an evil force and journey to the galaxy.<br><br><i>Darius II</i>, or <i>Sagaia</i> as it is known in the West, is the second installment in Taito's shoot 'em up series.
