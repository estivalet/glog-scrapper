  "description": "<i>Super Boy II</i> has less to do with any version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Mario+Bros%2e+2\">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> than it does with its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-boy-i\">predecessor</a>, which is, in turn, based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros\">first Super Mario</a> game. The game is identical to the first installment of the Korean-made unlicensed Mario conversions in terms of gameplay and visuals; level design is also very similar, with only slight variations and no new terrain, enemies, traps, etc. <br><br>None of the features omitted in the previous entry returns in this iteration; once again, there are no secrets, underwater stages, warp zones, bonuses, or other power-ups besides the mushroom. The only difference is in the actual layout of the locations, as well as in the message following a Bowser encounter in a castle; instead of being greeted by &quot;Sorry Nothing&quot;, the player is encouraged by the order &quot;Go! Next stage&quot;.",
