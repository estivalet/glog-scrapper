  "description": "The fourth entry in Zemina's series of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=mario\">Super Mario</a> conversions contains, like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-boy-iii\">predecessor</a>, its own levels. Most of the design ingredients are lifted straight from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Mario+World\">Super Mario World</a>, with familiar stage themes and enemies. A few level design elements and some of the enemies, however, are original.<br><br>Unlike <i>Super Mario World</i>, the stages are completely linear. There is no overworld, and the levels themselves contain no secrets or bonus areas. Like in the preceding games, it is impossible to enter pipes. There are also no boss battles or stage hierarchy; levels composed out of elements taken from ghost houses and castles of <i>Super Mario World</i> (ghosts, skeletons, fire creatures, etc.) are grouped together and eventually give way to another series of outdoor levels. <br><br>As opposed to the previous games, the protagonist in <i>Super Boy 4</i> is not Mario, but a thinner white-skinned young man. Mario's mushrooms are replaced by milk, and the flower turns into a hand icon; this power-up, which allows the hero to throw little orbs at enemies, also makes his skin dark. There is no cape power-up and also no Yoshi (though the fruits he eats are still present); however, the invincibility power-up appears much more prominently than in Mario games.",
