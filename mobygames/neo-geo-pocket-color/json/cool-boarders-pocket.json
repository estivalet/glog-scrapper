  "description": "<i>Cool Boarders Pocket</i> is a snowboarding game from the <i>Cool Boarders</i> series.<br><br>Compared to the home console version, this game changes the perspective to an isometric view and switches the focus of the game from pulling off stunts to navigating from start to finish. Players can choose one of two playable characters (Ken or Jun) and then can choose the Free Ride or Survival modes.<br><br>The Free Ride mode requires players to complete a level as fast as possible, while the Survival mode has players go through an endless stage until they lose all their health. Beating the best time on the Free Ride stages will unlock new courses, including special bonus stages. Players will constantly have to avoid obstacles and jump over gaps in order to progress through the levels.<br><br>The game also offers an unlockable Snowgirl Mode, which allows players to control a snowboarding snowman.",
