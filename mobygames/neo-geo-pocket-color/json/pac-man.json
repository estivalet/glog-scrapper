  "description": "One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, <em>Pac-Man</em> stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.<br><br>Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (&quot;Inky&quot;), the trailing red ghost Shadow (&quot;Blinky&quot;), the fast pink ghost Speedy (&quot;Pinky&quot;), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (&quot;Clyde&quot;).  One touch from any of these ghosts means loss of a life for Pac-Man.<br><br>Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating one of the four Power-Pills located around the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.<br><br>Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions starring Pac-Man and the ghosts.",
