  "description": "<i>Neo Dragon's Wild</i> is a video poker game.<br><br>B button is used to bet in the initial stage, being able to bet between 1 and 5 credits. A is then used to draw. Once the initial cards are drawn, the player can choose to hold using B, or draw with A. There is an auto hold feature that can be turned off from the default on. The second draw will either end with the player losing, or winning. If the player wins, they then have the option to double using the B button, or take your winnings with A. If you choose to double your winnings, you will enter a mini game of high or low card, which will continue until you either take your winning or lose.<br><br>There are screens giving odds for different card combinations, book keeping tracking what outcomes you have had at all aspects of the game, as well as multiple saves.",
