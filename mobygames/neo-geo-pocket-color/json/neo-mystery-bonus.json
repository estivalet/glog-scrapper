  "description": "<i> Neo Mystery Bonus </i> is a casino slots machine, with a few extra bonus games activated by certain outcomes.<br><br>Using A and B, the player is able to set bets, spin the reel, and choose whether to take any winnings, or double up or &quot;DUP&quot;, as the game shortens it too. The doubling up mini game is High Low cards, with the game providing you the previous 5 cards. This can be played to double any success in the slots machine, which depending on your bets, will reward you for combinations starting with the central row for 1 credit, then the top most row, the bottom row, a top left to bottom right diagonal and bottom left to top right diagonal at 5 credits, added in that order. You can add more credits, following the same order, up to a maximum of 10. There are a variety of combinations that will pay out different odds depending on the combination. Some of these combinations will activate their own mini games, such as the title's Mystery Bonus for getting three question marks lined up.<br><br>There are book keeping menus, as well as instructions on how to play and on the payouts for each combination.",
