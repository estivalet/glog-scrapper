The pupil goes out to take a photo of the leader of a group of ghosts that have escaped from ancient times. The photo is needed to make an amulet that will help banish the ghosts from the world once and for all.<br><br>The aim of the game is to talk to people, find out where to find Japanese spirits and then take photos of them using a mysterious camera called Ungai. Picture taking is the game's form of combat. Not only must players move the camera when taking a photo, they must make sure the picture comes out sharp as blurry photos will decrease the player's health.",
