  "description": "Only a select few wrestlers have what it takes to become a champion. And in the world of IEW which hosts over 300 matches in a year only the best of the best are in demand. And now, with the IEW champion Josef Steele's absence, a story of 8 top wrestlers competing for the champion's belt is about to begin...<br><br><i>Big Bang Pro Wrestling</i> is a wrestling game which shares a lot of features with the Fire Pro Wrestling series, such as the focus on grappling the opponents and characters which are based on famous wrestlers. There are 8 wrestlers available to play as, as well as 2 hidden characters that are selectable after completing the story mode. Each wrestler has his own unique moves and a special signature move which can help players end matches in their favor. This game has 4 gameplay modes: The IEW Champion mode is the story mode, which will have players facing the other seven wrestlers twice before they can face Josef Steele. In the One Match and Tournament modes, players can start a match with the computer and make changes to the time limit, rules, ring color, and the difficulty of their opponents. In these modes, they can also select the option to win a match by throwing their opponents into an open casket or by climbing a rope outside of the ring in order to reach a bag of cash. The fourth mode is a VS Match that allows players to compete against other Neo Geo Pocket Color owners.",
