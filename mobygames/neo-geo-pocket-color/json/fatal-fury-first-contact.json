  "description": "Using the world-famous Japanese SD (Super-Deformed) artwork style, this is the only title of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Fatal+Fury\">Fatal Fury</a> series to be released on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=SNK\">SNK</a>'s color handheld.<br><br>The game is based on its arcade/console counterpart <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/real-bout-fatal-fury-2-the-newcomers\">Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers</a>, and has its main characteristics, like the possibility of execute special moves while blocking (a.k.a. <b>Breakshots</b>), the execution of high-strength blows (a.k.a. <b>S. Power</b> and <b>P. Power</b> moves) and the starring of two new combatants (Li Xiangfei and Rick Strowd).<br><br>Due to NGPC hardware limitations, some characters have been removed from the main cast (as well as the background/foreground battle plane system). With this, the fighters initially available for this contest are: Andy Bogard, Terry Bogard, Joe Higashi, Mai Shiranui, Kim Kaphwan, Ryuji Yamazaki, Rick Strowd, Li Xiangfei, Billy Kane, Wolfgang Krauser, and Geese Howard.",
