  "description": "<i>Dive Alert: Becky's Version</i> is an RPG for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. There is another version of Dive Alert called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dive-alert-matts-version\">Dive Alert: Matt's Version</a>. The two games are rather like joint <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pokemon\">Pokemon</a> releases (Red/Blue, etc) wherein they are overall the same game with a variety of smaller differences.<br><br>The player takes control of a character named Becky. The game takes place in the future and the world is primarily surrounded by water. The only land is a small patch called Terra. The player must prove their worth to be accepted on to Terra by proving their skill as a submarine commander and destroying enemy vessels.<br><br>Becky's version features different characters, items and boats from Matt's Version. These are logged in a device similar to a Pokédex (from Pokemon). Battles take place against enemy ships and a radar view is used to help the player guide torpedoes towards the enemy vessels. Much of the game is text-based with animated cutscenes. <br><br>The game features the ability for two players to link up Neo Geo Pocket Color units to exchanges ships and data, and to battle one on one.  The game also features battery back-up and a training mode.",
