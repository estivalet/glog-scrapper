  "shortName": "drop-off",
  "description": "<i>Drop Off</i> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Breakout\"> Breakout</a>, in that the player controls a paddle which can move left and right, hitting a ball which the player is using to eliminate jewels at the upper end of the play field. The game differs from <i>Breakout</i>, however, in that the paddle can also be moved up and down, the jewels are moving down toward the player's paddle, and there is a border at the bottom of the play field which bounces the ball back.<br><br>The plot of the game involves the antagonist character's girlfriend being in a coma. A muse appears and tells the player that his girlfriend is trapped in a nightmare and is possessed by someone. The muse then casts a spell to put the player into her dreams.",
