  "description": "<i>Maison Ikkoku: Omoide no Photograph</i> is a Japanese menu-based graphical adventure game based on the anime and manga series. Players control Yusaku Godai and will need to help him find a secret photograph that's been hidden away by the manager. Godai will need to bribe the inhabitants, which constantly move around the house in order to get access to Kyoko's room. But even if Godai makes it into the manager's room and tries to look at the framed photo, something will always happen which will force Godai to leave the room. Thus, after multiple attempts, Godai makes the (il)logical decision to gather photos of all the inhabitants of the boarding house to make Kyoko show him the photo. The game has the player move between locations in the boarding house and the town, constantly running out of money, and meeting all the cast from the original comic book, including Nikaido who did not appear in the anime.",
