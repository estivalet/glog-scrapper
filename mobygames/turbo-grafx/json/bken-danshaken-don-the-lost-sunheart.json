  "description": "<i>B?ken Danshaken Don: The Lost Sunheart</i> is a 2D side-scrolling flying shooter with a basic structure, but with some peculiar elements. Enemies have many fantasy elements. For instance, the first boss Shinjuku Kid is a huge red-skinned baby with a spine made of eyeballs.<br><br>At the beginning of the game you may choose to play it in story mode or not. The story mode contains cut-scenes between stages that can also be skipped by pressing a button. There is an easy and a hard mode available, and only three continues.<br><br>The basic structure is like the majority of side-scrolling shmups, you progress until the end of the stage where you fight a boss. During the stages you collect several power-ups, special items, 1-ups and life restocks (the ship has a life gauge). Power-ups and items are released by destroying some kind of strange bouncing and rotating chess pieces, but a couple are mandatory and released by certain bosses.<br><br>At some points of the game you change ships, with just aesthetic differences, they do not have different stats.\nProgressing through the game (at the beginning you have none) you receive 5 auxiliary &quot;option&quot; weapons, you may equip and change them at will pausing the game and choosing them in a small menu.<br><br>On top of the screen level's name and during boss fights also boss's name are displayed (as well as your ship's and boss's life gauges). There is no damage in hitting floors and walls, but if you get caught in a wall scrolling out it's instant death, and when you loose a ship you loose also special items and your shot power rank goes down.\nDespite the &quot;chapter&quot; reference in Japanese title, there are not other games before of following this one.",
