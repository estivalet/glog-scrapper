  "description": "The TurboGrafx-16 version of <i>Batman: The Video Game</i> is a top-down maze-like game, somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bomberman\">Bomberman</a>.<br><br>The game consists of five stages based on the movie: the Streets of Gotham, Flugelheim Museum, AXIS Chemical Factory, the Parade and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker. The first four stages are divided into 12 sub-stages or mazes. Each main level has its own objective, which basically consists of finding items in the mazes: collecting &quot;smilex&quot; components in the streets of Gotham, cleaning paintings at the museum, planting bombs at the factory and cutting off the ropes of Joker's balloons at the parade. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.<br><br>Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang. Through the levels, he will collect items which will upgrade his speed and give his Batarang a longer range and multiple shots.",
