  "description": "<i>Puzzle Boy</i> is a port of the Game Boy title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kwirk\">Kwirk</a>, but features more and different levels along with changed graphics. In contrast to the original version, the perspective is straight top-down and there is no undo-function.<br><br>However, regarding gameplay this is still a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/soko-ban\">Soko-Ban</a> variant. The player finds himself in a maze and needs to find the way to the exit. The obstacles on the way are boxes which can be pushed but not pulled, holes and revolving doors. The game features three playing modes, most notably the level mode with 100 levels. They are divided over four sets of 20 each. Those sets have a difficulty level associated with them and each rewards the same ending when solved. The other two modes are the challenge mode (solving ten levels in a limited amount of time) and a split-screen multiplayer mode.",
