  "description": "<i>Cross Wiber: Cyber-Combat-Police</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cyber-cross\">Cyber Cross</a> and follows the adventures of Cross Wiber, an special inspector of the cyber combat police. Several years after the happenings in <i>Cyber Cross</i>, a new threat threatens Earth: Duma and his alien forces. Wiber now starts his counter-attack on Duma.<br><br>This game is a side-scrolling action game with emphasis on combat, but also with some platforming sequences. The player has the ability to switch between four forms: human and three robot suits. All those forms have different abilities, e.g. one robot has a special gun and the human can only kick to attack but is the only form which has a special attack taking up a bit of life energy. The power-ups which can be collected during play have different effects depending on the used form, e.g. as human everything gives life energy and as robots there are weapon and armor upgrades as well as ammo.",
