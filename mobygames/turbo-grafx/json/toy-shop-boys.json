  "description": "<i>Toy Shop Boys</i> is a vertically overhead scrolling shooter where you take control of three boys who have to fly across many levels blasting evil minions to reach a fortress belonging to the evil Gamma who has stolen all the toys. Each boy has his own unique weapon including boomerangs, vulcan gun and a rotating sword. You can only control one boy at a time but a press of a button switches control of another boy. Scattered across the levels are power-ups which can enhance your weapons, give invulnerability or use a smart-bomb. The two player option isn't simultaneous so each player takes it in turn to play after each life is lost.",
