  "description": "The action in this racing game is viewed from above and features rotational controls. There are 6 racetracks featured including real-world ones such as Laguna Seca. Before each race you can buy a full compliment of upgrades and weapons, with each area (engine, handling, turbo and so on) having several variably-priced options. The unusual thing about the racing system is that the action always follows the leader. If you slip too far behind, your car is blown up and placed back onto the track further on in order to keep up (similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Micro+Machines\">Micro Machines</a>). This can only happen a limited number of times before the game is over.",
