  "description": "<i>Lode Runner: Lost Labyrinth</i> is an exact conversion of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Miner\">Lode Runner</a>. However, this version features one hundred levels which mostly differ from the original ones. Another difference is that the levels scroll.<br><br>This is a platformer in which the protagonist needs to collect all gold which is spread out over the levels. Unfortunately there are a lot of enemies roaming around which should be avoided. The protagonist can't jump and so he needs to resort to ladders and horizontal ropes for dodging. The only way to temporarily get rid of a guard is to make a hole in the ground where they can't get out when falling in. After a certain amount of time a hole is filled up and a trapped guard respawns.",
