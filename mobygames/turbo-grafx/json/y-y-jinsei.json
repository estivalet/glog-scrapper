  "description": "<i>Y? Y? Jinsei: Victory Life</i> is a video game adaptation of the board game &quot;The Game of Life&quot; for up to five players, either controlled by human or computer players. Players are displayed as little cars driving on a road track, symbolizing a whole life from birth to death. Each turn players have to spin a wheel, determining the number of fields the player advances on the &quot;board&quot;, which will almost always result in an event. Events can either be positive or negative, mostly influencing your account balance. In the course of the game, players will take on a profession, marry and might get children. The game ends when every player reaches the retirement phase. The player who is wealthiest by then wins the game.",
