  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Momotarou+densetsu\"> Momotar? Densetsu</a> continues its story, which is based on an old Japanese folk tale. Momotar? is a boy who was found by an old couple inside a giant peach. When he grew up, he found three faithful companions - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, and with their help defeated the evil demons of the Demon Island. Three years have passed since. Momotar? and his friends do not suspect that deep beneath the Demon Island there lies a palace, in which resides Emma, the King of Hell. Unable to accept the victory of the humans over the demons, Emma sends his three most terrifying demonic servants to challenge the humans once again. It looks that Momotar?'s adventure wasn't over, after all...<br><br>Like the first game, this is an &quot;old school&quot; Japanese RPG with simple gameplay mechanics. Moving Momotar? over the world map, you visit towns, talk to people, buy weapons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.",
