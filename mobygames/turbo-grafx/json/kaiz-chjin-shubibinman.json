  "description": "The evil robot Dark Skull has escaped Doc's control and now threatens to destroy the city with his army of evil robots, now only Doc's newest creations: the cyborgs Tasuke and Kyapiko can put an end to his plans.<br><br><i>Shubibinman</i> is a 2D side-scrolling action platformer, in which you play as either of the Shubibinmen (or both in the cooperative 2-player mode) and try to defeat Dark Skull's forces using your blade and your cyborg-powers. The game starts in a city-map from which you select which stage to tackle next, each stage features a hostage and a boss cyborg that must be defeated. Successful completion of these objectives rewards you with money that you can take back to &quot;Doc&quot; for upgrades that augment your existing powers or add new ones, which you'll surely need for the final battle.
