  "description": "<i>Splatterhouse</i> is the first game in the series, but only the second game to appear on a home console (after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/splatterhouse-wanpaku-graffiti\">Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti</a> on the NES), which was later continued on the SEGA Genesis.<br><br>Rick and his girlfriend Jennifer enter West Mansion (known as Splatterhouse) to study Dr. West's parapsychology teachings for a school project.  After a flash of lightning and a scream, Jennifer is gone, and Rick is left wearing the Terror Mask, which gives the wearer great strength.<br><br>Rick must survive seven blood-soaked levels full of corpses, demons, and other disturbing creatures in this arcade side-scrolling beat-em-up. Several weapons are at Rick's disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun. If Rick wants to find Jennifer alive, he must move quickly through the floors of the mansion.... as a happy reunion is not always guaranteed.",
