  "description": "Originally released only in Japan on the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16), <i>Battle Lode Runner</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lode+Runner\">Lode Runner</a> and its major draw is a 5 player mode. Players move around several platforms collecting gold. Various enemies inhabit the levels, and the player, armed with a drill, attempts to drill holes to capture the enemies.  Unfortunately, this does not defeat the enemies, only disables them for a short time. After a few seconds, the enemies respawn and resume their chase of the player.<br><br>The five-player option was new to any incarnation of Lode Runner, and operates in a very similar manner to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Bomberman\">Bomberman</a>, except with hole drilling instead of bombing.",
