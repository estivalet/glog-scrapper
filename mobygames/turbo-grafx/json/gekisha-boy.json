  "description": "<i>Gekisha Boy</i> is a 2D side-scrolling game in which you play the part as a camera man who is out to snap some high paying photos to please their contractor. You control the movement of the shutter aim and you have slight control over the character as well (using the same style of control as such games as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Cabal\">Cabal</a>). You walk along a side-scrolling street and you have to snap unusual/tragic/funny or simply weird photos to rack up the points. It can be anything from crashing airplanes to Marilyn Monroe lookalikes and UFOs abducting cars. Every stage has a set score you need to reach to progress to the next one or you have to start it over again.<br><br>The PlayStation version <i>The Cameraman: Gekisha Boy Omakefu</i> is an updated and expanded port released as Volume 94 of the <i>Simple 1500</i> series and contains an additional stage. It also has an unlockable cooperative mode with a second player as the Gekisha Girl. Otherwise the versions are identical in graphics, sound and gameplay.",
