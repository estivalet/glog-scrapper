  "description": "<i>Valkyrie no Densetsu</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/valkyrie-no-bken-toki-no-kagi-densetsu\">Valkyrie no B?ken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu</a>, which puts you in the shoes of a young Valkyrie of Norse mythology as she sets out to reclaim the fabled golden seed, which has been stolen by an evil god.<br><br>The gameplay is top-down action with platformer elements, discarding the RPG elements of the previous game. You must navigate the many levels that compose Valhalla and defeat all the enemies in your path while sorting out chasms and other platformer-styled obstacles.<br><br>You can also find several NPCs in each stage, who offer gameplay hints, clues and items to buy with the gold stolen from fallen enemies. You can buy health power-ups, improved weapons and even magic spells for added fire-power.",
