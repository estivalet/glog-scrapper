  "description": "<i>Pro Yakyuu World Stadium</i> is the first baseball game released for the PC-Engine. The general gameplay as well as the graphics style closely resembles that of Namco's own &quot;Family Stadium/Famista&quot; baseball series for the Nintendo NES/Famicom. Game options include a one or two-player mode as well as watching two computer opponents play against each other. Players can choose from one of ten non-licensed teams.<br><br>The game itself follows the standard formula of nearly all baseball games of its time, with having a 3rd-person view from behind the batter during the pitching/batting scenes and an overhead view of the field once the player hits the ball. Progress is saved via passwords given after each match.",
