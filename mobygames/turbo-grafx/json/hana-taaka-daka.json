  "description": "<i>Hana Taaka Daka!?</i> is a horizontally-scrolling shoot'em-up set in a fantasy universe. You control a long-nosed flying mythical creature and the monsters you face are tanuki (racoon dogs) impersonating birds, animals or even traps such as falling stones. You play as the sacred Tengu to rescue Inari who has been abducted by the evil tanuki lord Jikanda. During the game, you find many power-ups to make your tengu more powerful, and several bonus stages are hidden, scattered around the colourful stages.",
