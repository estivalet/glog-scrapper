  "description": "Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. <br><br>As with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Core+Design\">Core's</a> previous hit <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rick-dangerous-2\">Rick Dangerous 2</a> there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four levels consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.<br><br>The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progression, as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.",
