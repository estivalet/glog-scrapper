Unless you kill Hecate by sun-up you will forever be doomed to be a creature of the night.<br><br>The world of Night Creatures consists of several different scenes, a town, a grave yard, a forest, and so on. You can travel from one scene to the next in a non-linear fashion.  You have to determine the fastest way to find the weapons and abilities you need to beat Hecate.
