  "description": "Hani, the Haniwa clay figure, (and Lemon if a second player is present), head out on a road trip. This time Hani has to defeat the demons that came from the God's Realm.<br><br>The game features a similar set up to earlier games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sonson\">SonSon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/shockway-rider\">Shockway Rider</a>. In each level the playfield is split into 4 separate paths. Hani can move freely between paths. The paths themselves are littered with pits that can be jumped and enemies which need to be kicked. Also on the paths are items like blue jars (collecting 25 will earn Hani an extra life), mystery jars which are worth varying points, rockets, trampolines, among others.<br><br>Hani can't take all day to complete a level as there is a countdown timer that will  cost Hani a life if he takes to long. Luckily there are a few time clocks scattered around which will put more time on the clock when collected.",
