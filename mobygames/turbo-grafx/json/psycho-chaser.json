A new battle android called &quot;Aura&quot; was developed and sent into battle, and seemed to be leading its country to victory. However, Aura broke free of human control and revolted against the Earth, taking control of the other androids and starting a war against humanity. In a last ditch effort, humanity developed one more android, stronger than any before and imbued with the wishes of humanity, dubbed &quot;Psycho Chaser.&quot; It is making its assault on Aura's stronghold to end the war.<br><br><i>Psycho Chaser</i> is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shooter. The player takes control of the titular battle android. There are multiple weapons which can be picked up and freely switched between, and also power-ups which allow for weapon and energy upgrades between stages.",
