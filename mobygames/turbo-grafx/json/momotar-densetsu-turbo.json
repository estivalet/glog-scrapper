  "description": "Although this looks like the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/momotar-densetsu\">Momotar? Densetsu for NES</a>, it is still a different game, with different map layout, events, etc.<br><br>The story follows the classical Momotar? plot: an old couple found a boy inside a giant peach, and named him &quot;Momotar?&quot; (peach boy). Later, the boy decided to rid the land of the evil demon tribe. Help Momotar? reach the Demon Island and defeat the demons!<br><br>Gameplay-wise and graphically, this is a typical Momotar? RPG: navigating the little hero through the top-down world map, the player visits towns, descends into dungeons, equips Momotar? with weapons and armor, buys items, and fights random enemies and monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.",
