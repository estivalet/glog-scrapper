  "description": "Set during the 24th century, a human settlement on Jupiter was attacked by hostile forces. These forces then moved on to start attacking Earth. To combat this menace, all of the Earth's armies made up of regional federations  joined together. The human army had a technical breakthrough with SERD, a  High Mobility Humanoid Weapon System, which gives the humans a chance to fight off the alien invaders. <br><br>This game is a turn-based strategy game. The player takes on the role of a captain of the mobile fortress aircraft carrier ALTEA. \nThe captain is in command of up to seven SERD pilots at a time. Each SERD unit has its own unique characteristics.<br><br>The game has 10 scenarios to play through. Battles can earn the pilots attack and evasion experience points which will increase their hit rate and evasion rate, respectively. Evasion experience is earned by dodging attacks.<br><br>",
