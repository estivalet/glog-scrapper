  "description": "Whereas  <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dragon-spirit\">Dragon Spirit</a> was a multi-format conversion, only Turbo-Grafx / PC Engine users initially got to play the lesser-known sequel at home. Gameplay-wise, little has changed from the original, as both games are vertically-scrolling shoot 'em ups putting you in control of a dragon. You are flying over built-up land, complete with rivers and their banks. The enemies and waves can be shot or avoided - shooting them reveals extra points as well as the occasional power-up. Ground units are shooting at you but can't be shot back, so be careful which parts of the screen you occupy at which times.",
