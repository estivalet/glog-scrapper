  "description": "The story of this game is rather simple: the world is in peril, as the evil witch Topaz sends her seductive minions to terrorize the wilderness, plotting to overthrow the rightful king and conquer the world. A young prince is born, who is destined to be the one who slays Topaz. His first quest is to retrieve a magical armor which is essential for the victory. But the evil sexy female demons will do everything in their powers to stop the hero...<br><br><i>Bodyconquest II</i> is in many ways a homage to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=dragon+quest+nes\"> Dragon Quest</a> game. The gameplay is nearly identical: the lone hero fights randomly appearing enemies in one-on-one battles, gains experience and money, gradually levels up, waits until he can afford better weapons and armor and venture into an area with stronger monsters, etc. Even the menu with commands such as &quot;Talk&quot; and &quot;Search&quot; is copied almost verbatim from the father of Japanese RPGs.<br><br>The one distinguishing feature of this game is the sex appeal of the enemies. They are young, female, and tend to wear less than what we would usually associate with the medieval codex of modesty. <br><br>Scantily clad girls, suggestive poses, and sexual innuendo abound; but no explicit scenes which would warrant an adult rating.",
