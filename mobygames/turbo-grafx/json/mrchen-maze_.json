  "description": "<i>Märchen Maze</i> is a platform/shooter game and conversion of Namco's 1988 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mrchen-maze\">arcade game of the same name</a>. The gameplay remains largely the same - the player takes control of Alice who must shoot bubbles at enemies to knock them off platforms. Unlike the arcade original which was in isometric perspective, Märchen Maze on the PC Engine is an overhead game. This version features different stages than the arcade game, and because of the lack of a time limit, many of the stages are much more expansive. The chequered platforms at the end of a level are static rather than moving, hopping on to them automatically takes you to the boss. Also, instead of starting from a checkpoint when you die, your lives are represented by balloons. Should Alice fall, you'll be respawned on the spot.",
