  "description": "The human colony &quot;Le Tau&quot; is under attack by some strange aliens. It is the player's job to use a special starship and destroy everything which moves. <i>Heavy Unit</i> is a typical side-scrolling shooter with six levels filled with enemies, mid and end bosses. <br><br>Destroyed enemies may leave behind items which have beneficial effects when collected: increased speed, better weapon power, a shield, extra lives or transformation into a robot. The robot has a more powerful weapons system (laser beam and homing energy balls instead of a vulcan gun), but also a downside: its large size makes it easier to be hit by enemies or crash into the environment. If that happens, a life and all collected upgrades are lost and the ship is reset at the last checkpoint.<br><br>While the level layouts are identical in all versions, there are some minor differences in enemy placement, graphics (e.g. the Genesis version has more colours and bigger enemies) and sound.",
