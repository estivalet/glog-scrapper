  "description": "Basketball was the second sport to which <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Cinemaware\">Cinemaware</a> applied their philosophy of lavish production and advanced cutscenes. Exhibition and league matches are on offer, with the opportunity to recreate a full league season with 1 player assigned to each of the 28 clubs. The game uses varying camera positions, with top-down views when the ball is close to either hoop, and a side-view when the ball is mid-court - controls remain unchanged for these, so the switch doesn't cause a sudden change in player movement.<br><br>As well as playing the matches you have full coaching control. This can involve making substitutions but also assigning marking and game strategies.",
