  "description": "The royal family of Bunnyland was kidnapped by monsters and the player has to save them by beating all six levels of this side-scrolling shooter. The reason why the protagonist, a rabbit, can fly is the rocket launcher on his back. <br><br>Just like in most shooters, the main objective is to survive the  way to the end boss of each level without getting hit by enemies (three hits result in a life loss). The rabbit has three ways to defend itself: a regular gun, a strong melee punch and limited homing missiles. The power ups are shield energy refreshments, extra points, invincibility, more missiles and missile upgrades.",
