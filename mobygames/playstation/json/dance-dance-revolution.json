  "description": "Simon has been taken to the next level in this arcade dancing game.  The game cues you which direction to step.  You use a special floor mat to step out the moves in rhythm.  The more moves you step out keeping the beat, the better your character does on screen.  You get to choose from 28 different songs to dance to.  It's possible to dance alone or with a friend.",
