  "description": "Michael Owen was England's youngest ever goalscorer and biggest hero, until superseded on both counts by Wayne Rooney. He put his name to a game balanced between the action of an arcade game and the realism of a simulation.<br><br>The game incorporates the leading international teams along with some 200 domestic teams from Europe, Japan, and USA. Each player's abilities are rated out of 10 in several key areas. Statistics including shots (in total and on target), fouls, and possession are recorded. Set pieces are controlled by moving a line to direct the ball. While trying to play a pass, the player can switch control to the footballer hoping to receive the ball.<br><br>The player can choose from competition structures including leagues and Cup championships, a practice mode, and single friendly matches, with the World Cup perhaps as the ultimate prize. It is also possible for the player to design own competitions.",
