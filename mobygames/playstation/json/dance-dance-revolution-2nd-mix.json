With a wide range of difficulty settings, the game is a challenge for veterans while being easy enough to enjoy for beginners.  2nd mix comes back with some new songs and some new remixes of old favorites.  Challenge your friends head on or work together.  For an added challenge try doing Double which puts you on both dance pads (provided you have two).  ",
