  "description": "This year's edition features motion-capture animation and commentary by Dan Fouts and Dick Enberg.<br><br>There are four primary modes of play, including season, arcade, franchise, and exhibition. The franchise mode keeps track of full individual player and team statistics over multiple seasons. Players will be drafted, improve throughout the course of their career, and retire into the game's hall of fame. The franchise mode also keeps track of statistics for the coach and the franchise. Career win/loss records, playoff appearances, and Super Bowl wins are tracked.  Season mode allows players to compete for one individual season, while exhibition mode allows for a single game to be played.  Arcade mode features simplified controls for those players looking to simply mix it up.",
