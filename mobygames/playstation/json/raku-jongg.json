  "description": "<i>Raku Jongg</i> is a puzzle game that combines falling-block mechanics of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tetris\">Tetris</a> with the rules of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Genre%3a+Card+%2f+Tile+game+-+Mahjong\">Mahjong</a>, based on a winning entry in ASCII's 1998 Entertainment Software Contest. Mahjong tiles drop in pairs from the top of the screen, and lining up three of the same type in a row will cause them to be removed from the board. Combinations are added to the player's hand at the bottom of the board, and completing a hand will add to the player's score. Several different modes are included, including a Story mode, 2-player versus mode, ranking test, and time attack.",
