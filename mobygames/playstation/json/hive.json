  "description": "<i>The Hive</i> is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-rebel-assault\">Rebel Assault</a>. All levels are rendered, with limit interactive influence by the user (works best with mouse). At the beginning, the game seems to be cool because of the different level designs, but later it gets repetitive, the designers ran out of ideas.",
