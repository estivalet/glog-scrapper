  "description": "<i>X-Men: Mutant Academy</i> is a fighting game featuring three-dimensional stages, but largely adhering to the rules of 2D fighters. The protagonists are a combination of the classic Marvel comics characters and the <i>X-Men</i> movie. Nearly every X-Men character is available, each with their normal moves (much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Street+Fighter\">Street Fighter</a> in terms of the buttons pressed on the control pad), and plenty of super moves to spice things up.<br><br>The CD also contains various bonus materials, ranging from movie clips of a fighter after the player has completed the game with him/her, new costumes (each fighter starts with costumes from the comics; the new ones, when unlocked, are much like the ones in the movie), and a movie story unlocked when the player completes the game with all of the fighters.<br><br>Also included is a movie trailer for <i>X-Men</i>, and comic art by Marvel designers Joe Maduera, Adam and Andy Kubert, and more.",
