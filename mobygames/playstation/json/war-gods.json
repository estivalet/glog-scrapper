  "description": "War Gods is a one-on-one fighting game that takes place in 3D environments. The fighter under your control can perform many different moves, and string those moves together to perform &quot;combos.&quot;  Furthermore, the fighters all have special &quot;finishing moves&quot; that eliminate your opponent in some gruesome manner at the end of a match.  There are 10 different fighters to choose from, all based on different ancient civilizations.<br><br>The graphics in War Gods are fairly unique. They were created by texture-mapping 3D character models with digitized photos of people.  This gives them a reasonably lifelike look.",
