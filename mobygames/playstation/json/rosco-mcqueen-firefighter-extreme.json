  "description": "The world's tallest building is burning down, and it's up to Rosco to save the day! It seems that the evil Sylvester T. Square and his robotic minions are responsible not only for the fire, but they've taken hostages as well.<br><br>Guide Rosco through the towering inferno as you rescue the innocent, squelch the fire, knock off the robots, and stop old Square once and for all. There are 15 blazing levels of action to work through, each more terrifying than the last. You'll need to watch out for a host of hazards including backdrafts, dangerous smoke, and electrical fires. With a dozen unique hazards in all, the robots are only the beginning of your problems!<br><br>Of course, you'll have your share of special weapons and power-ups to help give you a boost: Water canisters, a Super Hose, food items, and CO2 cartridges are just a few of the items you'll have on hand. Just like any fire fighter worth his salt, Rosco always has his axe on hand too, which comes in handy against menacing robots. Make sure to keep an eye on the temperature, too; if the heat gets too high, your game is over.",
