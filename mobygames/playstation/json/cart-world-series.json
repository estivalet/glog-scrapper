  "description": "CART World Series, endorsed by Championship Auto Racing Teams, is Sony's first attempt at the world of CART racing. With the official endorsing and license, the developers were able to include a lot of realistic elements from the racetrack into the game.<br><br>All of the top-rated CART drivers (circa 1996-1997) have been included and programmed to match their real-life abilities (based on a statistics standpoint). Al Unser Jr., Bobby Rahal, Gil de Ferran and many more are there to use or to race against. Each one has their own unique car, which can be tuned-up and modified any way you'd like<br><br>Modification comes in the way of tweaking a car's performance. If you know a lot about cars and how they handle, you can adjust their tires to fit the road (hard or soft) as well as modify their gear systems and aerodynamics. By moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings, you may be able to find a perfect combination for speed and performance. During races, a car's tire will wear down and it will eventually run out of fuel. Pit stops are necessary for a successful victory.<br><br>In addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after their real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience.<br><br>As far as gameplay goes, you've got the following options: Arcade, Simulation, Practice, Single Race, 10 Race Season. The season play is simply a series of races in which you must qualify and race for the cup and the arcade and simulation modes both keep track of individual racer statistics. If you're still getting used to an Analog Controller, you may want to make a few practice runs before starting a season.<br><br>Additionally, CART World Series supports two players via split-screen or a Link Cable.",
