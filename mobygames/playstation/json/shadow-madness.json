  "description": "Something is going wrong in the land of Arkose: cities destroy themselves, monsters attack innocent citizens, diseases spread among the people. A giant blast has destroyed a whole town, only a young guy named Stinger narrowly escaped death. Stinger engages himself on a quest to avenge his hometown's destruction. On his journey he meets the beautiful elven girl Windleaf and the robot Harv-5, who help him to reach his ultimate goal.<br><br>Although it all seems like a typical Japanese RPG, it is not. <i>Shadow Madness</i> was developed and produced in the USA, although, beyond any doubt, the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Final+Fantasy+Series\">Final Fantasy series</a> has been the main source of inspiration here. The battles are random, like in many Japanese RPGs, and the battle system is almost the same like in Final Fantasy games: menu-based, with several sub-menu choices. The graphics are in 3D with polygonal characters in anime/manga style (what some people call &quot;deformed&quot;).",
