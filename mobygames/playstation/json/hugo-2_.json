  "description": "The Adventures of Hugo continues...<br><br>After saving his family from the evil witch in the first game, Hugo and his family are flying back home in Hugo's biplane. Little did they know, that they are in danger once again. The evil witch Scylla has somehow managed to get the possession of a very old magic book, once which allows the user to control the weather. She manages to summon a very ominously looking cloud.<br><br>Scylla sends the cloud after Hugo's biplane to re-capture Hugo's wife, Hugoline, laughing very evil-like while doing so. The cloud manages to catch up to biplane, unbeknown for Hugo\nthat it is Scylla's old tricks at first. Hugo soon notices the cloud, but is too late to do anything about it. The cloud manages to nab Hugoline within itself and leaves back to Scylla.<br><br>Once Hugo notices that Hugoline is missing, he knows it was Scylla behind the cloud. But the kids are still on the backseat, which then Hugo gives them parachutes and tells them to jump off the plane. Right after the troll kids jump off the plane, Hugo fortunately manages to crash land at a snowy mountain. He then starts his quest to get the kids and his wife back.<br><br>The gameplay is little bit of a mix pack of an arcade-style action-puzzle elements. On one level you are in 2D side-scrolling view, on the another platforming on constantly appearing\nand disappearing ice pillars while also trying to avoid hazardous obstacles and death screens (even though those are humorously made) and solving small puzzles within the levels.",
