  "description": "A turn-based strategy game based on the characters of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Parodius\">Parodius</a> shooter series. You take your pick out of 8 classic characters from the Parodius games and pit their unique armies against the other character's in several scenarios in an all-out battle for total supremacy.<br><br>Gameplay is divided between strategic phases played in a &quot;world map&quot; from which you build up your army and attempt to take control of several factories that provide the resources needed for unit creation,  and tactical turn-based battles in which you deploy your army in hopes of taking over a control zone or similar objective from an opposing player (either human or AI-controlled).<br><br>The game uses a combination of 3D backgrounds and 2D sprites for units and characters. As usual for games in the series, the game is filled with bizarre humor and parodies many other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Konami\">Konami</a> franchises.",
