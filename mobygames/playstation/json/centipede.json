  "description": "This is a remake or &quot;modernization&quot; of the classic arcade shooter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Centipede\">Centipede</a>, originally released in arcades by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Atari\">Atari</a> in 1980.  This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration.  Gameplay progresses through five &quot;worlds&quot;:  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A &quot;classic&quot; mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new &quot;3D&quot; isometric perspective.",
