  "description": "<i>pop'n music 6</i> is one of the many titles in Konami's long-running rhythm game franchise, and the last to appear on the original PlayStation. Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen along nine tracks, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the &quot;groove meter&quot; increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.<br><br>This release includes all of the music from the arcade version, along with an extensive collection of tracks from previous releases, for a total of over 100 songs available to play. It also included support for an online high-score ranking service, though this has since been closed. It also functions as a Key Disc for the Append Disc releases in the series, much like Konami's other Bemani franchises.",
