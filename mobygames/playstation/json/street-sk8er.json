  "description": "<i>Street Sk8er</i> was one of the first skateboarding games to hit the PlayStation. It is much simpler than its genre brother <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tony+Hawk%27s+Pro+Skater+series\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>, with a simpler way of performing tricks and more linear stage design. What it does bring to the table though is a tailor made licensed soundtrack with artists such as H2O, Less Than Jake and I Against I, and some hidden characters and stages to unlock as the player progresses through the game. There are different characters to choose from, boards and stages.",
