It features reproductions of three pachinko machines made by Sanyo Bussan, all of which are returning from previous releases: <i>CR Umi Monogatari 3R</i> and <i>CR Umi Monogatari 6</i> from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sany-pachinko-paradise-2-umi-monogatari-special\">Pachinko Paradise 2</a>, and <i>CR Wan Wan Paradise SK</i> from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sany-pachinko-paradise-3-wan-wan-daikshin\">Pachinko Paradise 3</a>. Each machine features new background graphics not found in the original versions.<br><br>There are two modes available: Ts?j? (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed. There is no story mode.",
