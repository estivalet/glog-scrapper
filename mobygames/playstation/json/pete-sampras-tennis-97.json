  "description": "Codemasters used their Pete Sampras license for a second time on this tennis game. Playing as either a male or female in singles or doubles matches, your ultimate aim is to win each of the 8 matches, which represent the finals of 8 tournaments The four Grand Slam tournament venues are unlocked when you win tournaments on the other four (in Barcelona, Hong Kong, Frankfurt and Moscow). Single matches or quick multiplayer knockout tournaments can also be played, the latter with up to 8 human players.<br><br>Lob, slice and drop shots each have their own control buttons, and spin can be comfortably applied. Serving involves stopping a curving arc at the right moment - there are three serve speeds and the arc's motion reflects this, so it is harder to get the faster serves accurate. Ten camera styles are available, encompassing both fixed and moving camera work.",
