  "description": "The hero of this game is a young man who enjoys playing video games (don't we all?..). One fine day, he rents a new game; after firing it up, a princess appears on the screen, calling for help. A moment later, a demonic hand reaches to the hero and pulls him into the TV! The hero is teleported into an alternate world, a kingdom that is a mixture of medieval and modern day-like environment. This world is in danger, and only those who have the magical &quot;voice power&quot; can save it! The hero meets the young female magician named Whip and the princess of the country, Fret; together, they must stop the evil and figure out a way for the hero to go back to his world.<br><br><i>Voice Fantasia</i> might look like an RPG, but in reality its gameplay is much closer to the adventure variety, the RPG elements reducing to a mini game-like status. Most of the gameplay here is dedicated to exploring the world, talking to characters, and acquiring and using items needed to advance the story. The infrequent turn-based battles are dictated by the story. Three girls join the party, and are able to use &quot;voice powers&quot;, which are in effect attacks of various properties. There is no experience system of any kind.<br><br>There is also a mild &quot;dating simulation&quot; element in the game. The player is able to buy presents for the girls, invite them for dinner, etc. When staying at the hotel, those anime-style fantasy characters are replaced by video footage of real voice actresses. The player is able to talk to them and ask a variety of questions.",
