  "description": "The fourth in the Pro Pinball series, this game once again features only one table. The theme is Victorian technology - by building such machines as an airship and submarine and performing various tasks (such as completing 'adventures' by shooting ramps), the goal is to defeat the evil General Yagov. A multi coloured dot panel is the main new feature compared to other Pro Pinball games.",
