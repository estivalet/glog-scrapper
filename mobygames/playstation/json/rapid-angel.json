  "description": "Three girls - Natsumi, Ayane and Haruna own a courier shop called Rapid Angel. When the girls take on the task of delivering some important blueprints it turns out that an evil organization is after these papers too.<br><br><i>Rapid Angel</i> is a mix of 2D platformer and beat-'em-up, so the players will explore the levels fighting enemies, collecting power-ups and avoiding traps. While basic moves are the same for all characters (running, double-jumping, using bombs etc.), each girl has her unique fighting style with Natsumi and Ayane relying on physical attacks and Haruna using mostly distance-type magic attacks. Particular fragments of levels and story sequences are different depending on the character chosen by the player. Two more characters are unlocked after beating the game.<br><br>In 2-player mode the second player controls an angel-thing that follows the first player's character aiding him along the way.\n ",
