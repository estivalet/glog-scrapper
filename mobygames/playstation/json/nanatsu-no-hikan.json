  "description": "In this mystery adventure game, a young man called Ippei has been given the key to the seven mansions his uncle wants to restore and turn into a resort. But these mansions were never fully explored and his uncle suspects a great treasure to be hiding somewhere on the premise, and Ippei is tasked to look into it. However, he is warned that there may be dangerous people lurking around. The game uses 3D graphics and a first-person perspective to let the player full explore the mansion up close. The more Ippei explores the mansion, the more he will find out about his family's history. Ippei can pick up and use various items, talk to other characters or simply think out loud to give clues to the player. While there are no action elements, the protagonist has a health bar which can be decreased if he is not careful and activates various traps that lie hidden throughout the mansions.",
