  "description": "<i>Taiho Shichau zo</i> (???????) is a police-themed adventure base on the manga and anime with the same title. The player takes on a role of a 24-year old rookie police officer who just graduated. The game starts with you coming to your new place at work, and the moment you arrive, a small incident occurs and you get misunderstood for a thief. After situation gets resolved, you get introduced into your new place of work and meet your colleagues, among others the two heroines from manga and anime TV series, Natsumi Tsujimoto (????) and Miyuki Kobayakawa (?????). The game consists of two gameplay elements. Adventure mode which resembles a typical visual novel style with fully voiced dialogues for all but the main character, and animated portraits of characters currently speaking, as well as action choices during dialogues. Patrol mode features a patrol map of town where the player, along with Natsumi and Miyuki, is performing routine patrol work which may trigger an event scene or one of the mini-games. The points are also awarded for various different elements during patrol work.",
