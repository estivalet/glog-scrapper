  "description": "Earth's defense satellites accidentally launch nuclear warheads due to computer malfunction.  Our planet is destroyed, except for a few factions that rebuild their strength and attempt to dominate the brave new world.  As you make your way across the wasteland, hunting down artifacts and destroying hostile forces, you find out that the satellite's unexpected nuclear launch may not have been entirely accidental after all...<br><br>You are in charge of searching the land for technological artifacts held by the other fellows.  These artifacts are then researched to create new weapons, chasses, and propulsion types, all of which are interchangable, meaning there are over 2000 units for you to blow stuff up with.  You can build tanks, hovercraft, Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) vehicles, as well as cyborg units.  There are machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers, mortars, etc.  Since all your technology comes from artifacts you swipe from your enemies, you are almost always fighting with weapons a step below what the other guy has, meaning you have to rely on your strategic prowess instead of sheer military superiority.  The battlefield is fully 3D, the camera is rotatable and zoomable, and all units are 3D as well, except for humans, which are sprites, but they aren't too plentiful, so it's a minor point.\n",
