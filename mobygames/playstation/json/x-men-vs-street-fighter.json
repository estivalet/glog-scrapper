  "description": "<i>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</i> is a fighting game, the first in which characters from the Marvel Comics universe (in this case, the X-Men) compete against Capcom's own creations, the heroes of the <i>Street Fighter</i> series.<br><br>The X-Men characters are mostly the same as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/x-men-children-of-the-atom\">X-Men: Children of the Atom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marvel-super-heroes\">Marvel Super Heroes</a>; three new characters are Rogue, Gambit and Sabretooth. The <i>Street Fighter</i> cast is based on that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/street-fighter-alpha-2\">Street Fighter Alpha 2</a>; however, the appearance and combat styles of some of them have been altered, to match the abilities of the X-Men heroes.<br><br>The gameplay system is similar to that of the aforementioned games, adding a tag-team gameplay feature. The player controls one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag the waiting one in at any time by hitting specific buttons; the tag partner will jump in with an attack and taunt the enemy. Resting character gradually recuperate their health. The two partners can execute the so-called &quot;variable attacks&quot;, which depend on the combination of buttons pressed.<br><br>The tag team feature has been omitted from the PlayStation version due to memory limitations.\n",
