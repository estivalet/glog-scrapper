  "description": "In <i>Battle Arena Toshinden</i> eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3D movement, <i>Toshinden's</i> game play can be considered similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/street-fighter\">Street Fighter</a>, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.<br><br>Two versions of <i>Toshinden</i> were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.<br><br>The U.S and E.U PlayStation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. <br><br>The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. <br><br>Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.<br><br>The later DOS version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese PlayStation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on PlayStation.",
