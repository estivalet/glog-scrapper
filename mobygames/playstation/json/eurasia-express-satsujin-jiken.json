  "description": "<i>Murder on the Eurasia Express</i> is a murder mystery played entirely as interactive movie adventure game. The player finds himself traveling on the Eurasia Express train with many high school students, all girls from private school, and a few of their teachers. One of the teacher had a bit of an early drink and to sober up withdrew himself in his cabin. Some time later he was discovered dead, murdered no less. Not many people are qualified to deal with it, but you just happen to be a private investigator and it falls to you to solve the crime and uncover the murderer before the train arrives at its destination which is in two hours.<br><br>With very little to start, you decide the good course of action is to interview everyone and check their whereabouts and alibis. Not everyone will speak truthfully, and some will keep their secrets until you force them open, while others will be open and help you as best they can. The game plays entirely as a live-action movie where player moves in segments following an animation from one location to another. But you're not entirely alone in your quest to unmask the killer. You are accompanied by Tsubasa Kataoka, one of the students, who also keeps info on all the suspects in her notebook, as well as other clues you uncover in your investigation.<br><br>By questioning the suspects, new dialogues may reveal or you may acquire new items which can be checked more thoroughly in your inventory. While dialogues are all movies, flashbacks are told via still photos showing precise events that the person you are questioning is informing you about. At any time during gameplay you can check your pocket watch to see how much time you are left with (you start at 11am and the train is to reach the destination at 1pm). The game features several Japanese idols as some of the school girls. The game doesn't let you explore the entire train but only focuses on a single car comprised of 6 passenger cabins, car attendant's room and a lounge are.",
