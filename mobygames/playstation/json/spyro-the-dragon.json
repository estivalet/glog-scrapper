  "description": "The evil Gnasty Gnorc has turned all the dragons in the Dragon Lands into crystal. He has also stolen the dragons' gems by locking them up in chests or turning them into soldiers for his army. But he forgot about one little dragon: Spyro. Now Spyro has to travel through the dragon kingdom and free all the dragons from their crystal prison, recover the dragons' gems and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. <br><br><i>Spyro the Dragon</i> is a 3D platform game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-64\">Super Mario 64</a>. The game consists of six worlds: Artisans, Peace Keepers, Magic Crafters, Beast Makers, Dream Weavers and finally Gnasty's World. Each world consists of a home or hub area, three regular levels, one flight level and one boss level.<br><br>The goal of the game is to beat Gnasty Gnorc by working your way through all six worlds. Along the way you  have to find all 80 dragons, collect all 12 dragon eggs and collect as many gems as you can. Gems are found scattered throughout the levels, in treasure chests. Also, each defeated bad guy yields a gem and end bosses hold several gems.<br><br>The inventory screen shows progress for each level, how many gems found and how many dragons, it also shows many there are in each level. The real challenge lies in completing every level 100%. To do this you really have to explore every nook and cranny, the last gems are usually located on hard to reach places.",
