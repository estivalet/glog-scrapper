  "description": "<i>360: Three Sixty</i> is an arcade and futuristic racing game set in a submerged world. Players can choose from multiple hovercrafts with different statistics based on acceleration, agility, armour and speed. Races take place in different environments with multiple laps per race. In addition to racing the vehicles can shoot each other and there is also a first-person reverse view to keep back chasers. Tracks contain pick-ups with new weapons and other types of items such as a shield. A regular cannon is always available as a weapon. Next to racing levels there are arena levels where opponents shoot each other and do not race. Game modes include Tournament, Time Trial and a two-player split-screen multiplayer mode.",
