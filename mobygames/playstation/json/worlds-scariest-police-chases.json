  "description": "<i>World's Scariest Police Chases</i> is an open world driving game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/driver-2\">Driver 2</a>. The player joins Sheriff Jon Bunnell in high speed police chases, inconspicuously tailing criminals and high way shoot outs.<br><br>The game takes place in a fictional city called Ashland. Players can freely patrol the vast city environment or take on a series of twenty missions. The first four missions tutorial levels, the rest of the missions involve taking on increasingly difficult criminals. Criminals range from a simple DUI or car thief to drug dealers, bank robbers and even a runaway tank.<br><br>Once you reach a criminal you must either pursue them long enough until they give up, or ram or shoot them until they are forced to stop. A blue and red bar at the bottom of the screen show the status of the criminal vehicle. The blue bar indicates how long you've been chasing a vehicle, the red bar is the damage indicator of the criminal vehicle.<br><br>A two-player co-operative mode exists, in which one player drives and the other shoots. There are hidden areas of the city to unlock, such as an airport and a church. Hidden came modes include a Halloween re-depiction and a low-gravity mode.",
