  "description": "In <i>Dark Delusion</i>, you play as Reina, a girl who was kidnapped with her family and taken away via ship to a far off kingdom and may be used for some unpleasant purposes. After escape, she must try to survive while helping the people that helped her. Her persecutors have interest in a mysterious gem brooch she owns, which gives her the power of controlling traps (pendulums, bombs, claws, arrows, and other lethal traps). <br><br>This is the third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Deception\">Deception series</a>. You control the character in a 3D environment in which you place traps to kill your persecutors (who have weapons). It's a real-time game with elements of strategy and role-playing, which allows you to use a system of timing and skill of activating traps through the rooms of a medieval castle as the opponents try to kill you. As you activate the traps, you can link them to activate each other, in way to increase the number of combos.<br><br>Depending on how you kill your opponents, and how many of them, determines how much &quot;Ark&quot; (money) you get to develop better traps. They can be created by using ancient black magic: emblems (fire, ice, thunder, poison, etc.), orbs (that improve the power of the trap) and rings (automatic, charge, damage, zero, etc.). <br><br>There are many other traps set over the environment, working automatically out of control of the player (spears, spikes, fans, etc.). They also can be used to increase the damage inflicted at the invaders. The game features over 2000 different traps, four modes of play (story, mission, training, license), trap element system (linking traps), and multiple endings that change according the choices you take through the story mode.",
