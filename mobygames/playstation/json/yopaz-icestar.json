  "description": "<i>Yopaz IceStar</i> is a homebrew/freeware puzzle game played on rectangular areas. The player must help Yopaz, a spheric small character, in its task to collect all the stars in the universe.<br><br>The only possible action is pushing Yopaz to one of the four cardinal directions: owing to the absence of gravity, it won't stop until coming in contact with the borders, or an obstacle. There are three sets of levels. 'Classic' and 'Tiny' are differentiated by the game area size. In 'Advanced' levels Yopaz needs to collect stars of different colours, and since it can only collect stars of its own colour, it needs to reach alight triangles on some blocks, that will turn its colour into theirs; elements such as teleporters and objects — still and moving —, fatal if coming in contact with, are also introduced.<br><br>There is the possibility to view online leaderboards, the score consisting in the time taken to complete levels.",
