  "description": "Belying its name, Sesame Street Sports is a racing game for one player rather than a conventional sports title. Geared toward young children, Big Bird serves as the game's host and play-by-play commentator and is often assisted by Elmo.<br><br>Players can choose from among six other Sesame Street characters, each of whom has his or her own racing vehicle and two special courses. Elmo rollerblades with in-line skates, Ernie navigates rapids in his bathtub with a kayak paddle, Telly sleds down icy slopes in a saucer, Cookie Monster bounces on a hopper ball, Zoe rides dirt tracks in a big wheel, and Grover pedals on a unicycle.<br><br>On each course, players can collect up to 18 tokens. Rather than race against other characters, players race against the clock, although there is no penalty nor adverse circumstances for taking a long time to finish.<br><br>The game also features an exercise training room in which Elmo performs jumping jacks, and players must push an action button to help Elmo work out.",
