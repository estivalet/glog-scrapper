However, Neumann is now gone, leaving the third division with low morale and little work, and eventually the main character from the previous game is the only member left. The third division is to be disbanded, but he appeals to the director, and is given one year to restore the third division to its former glory.<br><br><i>Y?ky? Gens?kyoku: 2nd Album</i> follows directly after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/yky-genskyoku\">the first game</a>, and is once more a traditional Japanese adventure game.
