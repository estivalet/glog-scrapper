  "description": "In <i>Pet in TV</i> the player takes control of a virtual pet, which resembles a more complex version of the Tamagotchi. The player can choose from a selection of PiTs and name it.<br><br>It is then up to the player to nurture their PiT and allow it to explore the 3D world, learning from its encounters with scenery and objects through trial-and-error. Once these behaviours are learn, the PiT will know how to respond to those objects in the future (such as a Flower, or a Spike). Whenever the PiT becomes injured, or tired, returning it to its home will allow Dr. Y to fix it. The objective then becomes for your PiT to solve puzzles on its own - for which it will be rewarded with AI upgrade chips.",
