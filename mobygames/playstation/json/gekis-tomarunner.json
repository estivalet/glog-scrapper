  "description": "<i>Gekis? Tomarunner</i> is an on-foot racing game with various crazy/fantasy/fable/mythological characters where the aim is to navigate the various split path tracks to victory. The game puts heavy emphasis on using the terrain to gain the upper hand over the opponent, and on top of that there are several bonus items to pick up which either can aid the player or be used as weapons against the opponents. The characters all run at a set speed, but using the left and right arm as well as well timed jumps on poles, springboards and hurdles will give the player a speed boost. If enough momentum is gained, the character leans forward and starts dashing at a much faster speed. Some areas will even allow the player to be airborne for a certain amount of time if the right path is chosen and if enough speed is gained. Hitting obstacles, getting punched by opponents or having any of the &quot;weapon&quot; items used against the player will slow their speed down significantly, sometimes even resulting in the character falling over in a stunned state.<br><br>There are several modes in the game to choose from, including a single player tournament and a two players versus mode.",
