Players can also earn points through this action as well as from winning races to upgrade their car and go head-to-head against the computer or against three CPU opponents.<br><br>Keiichi Tsuchiya, a racing champion from Tokyo and Masaaki Bando, a top automotive expert from Japan both lent their expertise to the game to ensure authentic handling and physics for each vehicle that was rendered in the game.",
