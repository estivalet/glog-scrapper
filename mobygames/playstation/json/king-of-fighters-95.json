  "description": "The first sequel in the <i>King of Fighters</i> series picks up a year after the end of the first tournament. Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...<br><br><i>The King of Fighters '95</i> introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of <i>The King of Fighters '95</i> is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the &quot;team edit&quot; concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the &quot;team edit&quot; feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.",
