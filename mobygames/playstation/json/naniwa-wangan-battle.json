  "description": "<em>Naniwa Wangan Battle</em> is a street racing game set in Osaka, Japan. The game features a variety of the usual poster cars of Japanese street racing of the mid 1990s, albeit without their real names or badges. The game contains a main “scenario” mode which features a light story between races, and your winnings can be spent on upgrades to your car. The game boasts the supervision of both Eiji “Tarzan” Yamada, a popular Japanese racing driver, as well as of Auto Select, a tuning and racing company from Osaka. As if that’s not enough star power, the game also presents real-life Kansai radio station FM802, along with the voice of Nakajima Hiroto, one of the station’s DJs.",
