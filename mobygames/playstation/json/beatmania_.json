  "description": "This is the first home release in the long running series of Beatmania games, part of Konami's BeMani franchise (DDR, DrumMania, Guitar Freaks and more). You get to play tracks from all genres on a special controller that looks similar to the original arcade one, with 5 piano keys and a &quot;turntable&quot;. Pieces of the song fall down the screen and you have to hit the right key or spin the turntable to nail the melody or drum piece falling. The better you get the higher your rating is, and you unlock more songs as you go.<br><br>This release comes with 2 CDs. The first includes the tracks from the coin-op &quot;Beatmania 2nd Mix&quot;. The second disc, a so-called &quot;append&quot; disc, features new tracks in the &quot;Yebisu Mix&quot;.<br><br>The first disc also functions as a key disc that allows &quot;append&quot; discs to start. Several further Beatmania releases come only in the form of &quot;append&quot; discs and thus require this release to work.",
