The game cycles through weeks, letting the player decide training activities to perform which in turn will increase his skills and character stats. As in other dating simulation games, player's stats may affect his conversation with girls he meets and how well they fit or get along together. Beside skill boosting activities, bulk of the gameplay is done using 1st-person visual novel style with static 2D anime characters over background with dialogue windows during conversations and dialogue options.",
