There are literally 100s of photo slides which can be played automatically or controlled by the player via fast forward and backward buttons with background instrumental music.</li><br>\n<li>CD Player: supports typical player options such as play, fast forward, stop and rewind on each of the three included songs which are &quot;Come and Kiss Me&quot;, &quot;Make Love in Dark&quot;, and &quot;Come and Kiss Me (Flying in Jamaica Mix)&quot;.</li><br>\n<li>Video Editor: starting with original music video clip the player can edit it and store it in a memory for future playback. But original music video is always available if one wants to start again from scratch and create a different edit.</li><br>\n<li>Video Player: this section automatically plays the official music video in full screen mode.</li></ul>",
