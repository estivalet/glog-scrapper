  "description": "In <i>007: Tomorrow Never Dies</i>, which is based on the movie of the same name, the player takes the role of the famous James Bond who fights against Elliot Carver. Carver tries to increase his TV ratings by creating a war between the British and the Chinese. To achieve his goal he sunk a British ship with his stealth ship and made it look like the Chinese Air Force was the offender. Now it is Bond's responsibility to set things right...<br><br>Most of the ten levels are like traditional third-person-shooters where the player walks around the levels while killing numerous foes. While there is an option for a free aim most enemies can be dispatched with the auto-lock function. This means if the player gets close enough to an enemy while using an appropriate gun the game automatically shoots at him when the player faces the general direction. Bond also has gadgets to his disposal which are used to fulfill the mission goals. There are two missions which differ from this formula: in the driving sequence the player chases and shoots at enemy cars while avoiding obstacles; during the skiing part he is mainly concerned with dispatching other skiers which want to bring him out of balance.",
