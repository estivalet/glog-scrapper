  "description": "<i>Dynamite Soccer 98</i> is a soccer/football game focusing on national teams and national team players of 1998. Aside from penalty kicks practice and training mode which includes free kicks, corner kicks, and other basics, there are four gameplay modes available. Exhibition mode is a quick play which lets 1 or 2 players start a quick match with selected teams. Tournament uses a typical tree structure and supports up to 16 teams, each of which can be set as player or CPU controller team. When two CPU teams play, only the result is displayed. A-Max Cup uses four groups of four teams after which it turns into a tree structure and elimination play, and All Star mode lets you assemble a team of top players from all available national teams. Basic setup such as selecting stadiums, changing strategies, replacing players, setting time duration for a full match, and other options are all available. The game supports 1 or 2 player matches, with up to 4 players using multi-tap.",
