  "description": "<i>Hih?t?: Arata Naru Sangeki</i> (??? ??????) is the first game in Kindaichi Case Files series to come on PlayStation platform. While the setting is the same as in TV anime, the game features an original story. The story protagonist is Hajime Kindaichi (??? ?), a 16-year old sophomore who inherited a knack for solving mysteries from his grandfather, a legendary detective.<br><br>As the title implies, the game takes place on Hihoutou, an island that is rumored to hold a vast treasure. An island owner, Shi Mimasaka (?? ?) was planning a treasure hunting tour, and Kindaichi found himself on the list of invited people. Along with his girlfriend, Miyuki, he went on the island only to find out that Mr. Mimasaka has been brutally murdered. There also has been a rumor that a monster is guarding the treasure on Hihoutou island, and as all the guests seem to have been unable to kill the island owner, the question of whether the island monster really exists became of utmost importance.<br><br>This murder mystery mainly plays as a visual novel, and focuses strongly on dialogues with other characters, but also allows the player to search each room and location, check info about suspects which he keeps track of in his notebook, and traverse the map, both in the mansion and all over the island. The game also features fully animated as well as pre-rendered cut-scenes. While the dialogue is no entirely present during conversations, animated cut-scenes feel just as the TV animated series.",
