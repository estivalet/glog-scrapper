  "description": "While series developer EA Canada moved the FIFA soccer series to new graphics engine technology with <i>FIFA 2001</i> on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fifa-2001-major-league-soccer\">PC and PlayStation 2</a>, it fell to Software Creations to update the series for the original PlayStation, with graphics similar to those from the previous years' versions and less teams and features than the next generation version.<br><br>The game includes teams from 16 national leagues (missing the Korean league from the PC/PS2 version) and 58 international teams (10 less than the PC/PS2 version). Gameplay modes are the same as on PS2: exhibition games, season play for the included leagues (without Brazil), tournaments (World Cup, EFA trophy and ECC) and a training mode. There is a player and team editor, but due to engine limitations, players are not modeled after their real-life counterparts as on PS2.<br><br>Four different camera perspectives are available in-game, customizable in height and zoom factor. Again due to engine limitations, the PS1 version does not feature any licensed stadiums. Controls are mostly the same as on the other versions, with simple, intermediate and advanced controls allowing for headers, volleys, one-touch moves, skill moves and in-game tactics changes. Noticeably absent however is the new power bar mechanic for controlling shot power.<br><br>",
