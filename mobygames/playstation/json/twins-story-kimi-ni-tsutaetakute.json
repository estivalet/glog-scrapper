  "description": "<i>Twins Story</i> is a romantic visual novel dating simulation adventure game. The protagonist is a high-school student and lives with his twin sister, Narumi Tateno, while his parents are working abroad. His goal beside studying? Well, to meet many many girls and try to make one of his choosing fall in love with him. While the typical visual novel gameplay consisting of dialogues and story branching choices are there, the game also puts emphasis on character's stats building which may help you get the girl of your choice, or be rejected due to lack thereof. The game features 10 different heroines, namely Saki, Rina, Izumi, Sayaka, Mami, Hanano, Yukino, Mizuho, Adelade, and Momoji, each with different hobbies and interests that you will have to try and match in order to make them take interest in you. The story progresses through calendar days where you can schedule things to do to increase your stats, visit various locations and talk to girls you meet during event scenes.<br><br>Bonus elements such as unlockable character gallery or fully unlocked BGM tracks can be accessed via main menu.",
