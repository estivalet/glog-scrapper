  "description": "Something strange has been happening in Kamiy?ga recently. Young girls have been falling into inexplicable comas, one after another. Suchie-Pai, defender of justice, believes that someone or something sinister is causing all this, but needs help finding the true culprit and saving the people of Kamiy?ga!<br><br><i>Doki Doki Nightmare</i> (&quot;The Throbbing Nightmare&quot;) is a Japanese-style adventure game with dating elements. The game is a spinoff of the popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Suchie-Pai\">Suchie-Pai</a> strip-mahjong series. The player is given a week to travel around the city of Kamiy?ga, interacting with its (primarily young and female) inhabitants to discover who has caused the strange curse on the city. The player can travel to a large number of locations throughout the city, and depending on what the player does and where, different story branches are unlocked.<br><br>In addition to the main game, the second disc features several minigames and a variety of bonus materials. After the game is cleared, it is also possible to ask other characters out on a date if their relationship has significantly progressed. Additionally, CG scenes and movies unlocked in the main game can also be reviewed here.",
