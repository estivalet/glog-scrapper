  "description": "Groove Adventure Rave is based on the manga and anime of the same name, written by Hiro Mashima. This action RPG puts the player in the shoes of Haru, the main protagonist of the manga. The game begins with a weird storm on the gang's ship where Haru is thrown overboard, along with Plue and, a little later, Elie. When Haru comes to the grand adventure starts. The only problem is, his sword (the Decaforce Sword) and Elie are both missing...<br><br>The game shares some similarities with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Diablo\">Diablo</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Shining+Soul\">Shining Soul</a> in that it is a hack'n'slash RPG seen from an isometric perspective. Haru can use normal attacks, but also charged attacks and has a small real-time inventory to aid him while in battle. Leveling up happens automatically when the experience meter is full, and doesn't interrupt gameplay with a statistics screen.",
