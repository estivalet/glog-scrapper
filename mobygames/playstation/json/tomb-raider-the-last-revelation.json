  "description": "According to Egyptian legend, Horus outwitted the evil god Set and imprisoned him in a secret tomb...<br><br>Five thousand years later, Lara Croft discovers the lost tomb and unwittingly unleashes the Set, fulfilling the ancient prophecy of his return to plunge mankind into darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all of her wit and skill to reimprison Set and save the world from Armageddon. Pursued at every turn by her arch-rival, the unscrupulous archaeologist Werner Von Croy, Lara embarks on a journey of discovery across Egypt, where she must overcome the most ingenious puzzles and infernal traps ever devised, and face terrifying evil from beyond the grave...<br><br><i>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</i> plays very similar to the previous games in the series, but some new things have been added to the game. The biggest addition is that now rather large parts of the game consist of several interconnected levels sometimes explored in any order, with puzzles in one level often requiring that some actions are done in other levels. The new additions to Lara's arsenal are a revolver and a bow with several sets of arrows including exploding and poisonous ones. The players will also find a laser sight which can be attached to any of the two weapons described above allowing manual targeting and zooming. Inventory now holds a binocular with built-in flashlight and a handy crowbar (found later in the game). Lara has also learned a few new moves: she can climb into the niches with low ceiling if the crouch button is pressed, she can now move around the corners while hanging and she can also pull levers and open trap-doors while jumping. <br><br>Graphics have been upgraded too - there are new light effects and water is now dripping from Lara's clothes when she gets on surface.",
