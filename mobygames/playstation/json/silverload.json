  "description": "Somewhere in the Old West lies Silverload, an old mining time. It has once been a vibrant, silver boom-town, but now it has become a ghost town, surrounded by perpetual storms. The town’s decline has started with a disastrous earthquake, but it may also be caused by an Indian curse, because the mine was built on land sacred to the Skaedi tribe. \nYou play the part of a bounty hunter who has been hired by the people of Silverload to find one of their children. The parents claim that it is kidnapped by &quot;the monsters of Silverload&quot;. If you survive long enough, you will discover the town’s dreadful secret. \nSilverload is a 3rd POV, inventory-based point and click adventure that belongs to the genre of horror adventures. It  includes a few arcade sequences: from time to time the player will become involved in gun fights. Silverload was originally developed for the Sony PlayStation. \n",
