  "description": "While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. <i>Rampage 2: Universal Tour</i> is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rampage-world-tour\">Rampage World Tour</a>, <i>Rampage 2</i> retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in <i>Rampage 2</i> include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.",
