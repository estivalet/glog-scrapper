  "description": "LMA 2002 is the third in the Playstation football management series, and also the first to be released for Playstation 2. The PS1 version features 8,000 players in 302 clubs, whilst PS2 expands this to 17,000 players in 722 clubs across the European leagues. Both platforms offer the choice of playing a full career or taking on one of 10 challenges, such as taking over the bottom-placed team mid-season and attempting to avoid relegation. Regardless of game mode, managers have access to detailed tactics and training settings, allowing you to work on players' weaknesses and build on their strengths.<br><br>The PS2 version lets you watch the full match in 3D, and both versions have a comprehensive highlights section, voiced on PS2 by real-life BBC analysts <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,27410/\">Gary Lineker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,380614/\">Alan Hansen</a>.",
