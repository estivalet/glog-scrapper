  "description": "<i>Ranma 1/2: Battle Renaissance</i> is a 3D fighting game. There is a Story Mode, a Battle Mode, and a VS Mode. The changing weather causes the cursed characters to change into their cursed forms when they get soaked in cold water, and back to their normal forms when they get soaked in hot water, affecting the players' fighting strategy. Throughout the game there will be rain squalls and geysers causing players and opponents to transform back and forth. This is the only Ranma 1/2 fighting game in which Ryu Kumon and Rouge appear.",
