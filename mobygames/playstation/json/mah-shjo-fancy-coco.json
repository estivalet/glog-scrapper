  "description": "Coco is a young princess in a magical kingdom, which has a tradition of shape-shifting magic. Her father, the king, explains to her that she must study magic for three years, in order to prove herself worthy of being a true heiress to the throne. Whether Coco will succeed or not depends on the player!<br><br><i>Mah? Sh?jo Fancy Coco</i> is similar in gameplay to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Princess+Maker\"> Princess Maker</a> games: the main goal is to make schedules for the young princess, alternating between actually learning magic and having vacations. Every activity influences Coco's stats, which in their turn influence her advancement in magics. Unlike <i>Princess Maker</i>, there is no RPG element and no free movement in certain locations. It is possible to visit the capital town and its nearby surroundings and talk to people, though those activities are only shown as still images. ",
