  "description": "<i>Marionette Company 2</i> is a direct sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/marionette-company\">Marionette Company</a> and you play as a same high-school student from the original. One day, while reminiscing on the events from the past, you stumble upon a pair of abandoned marionettes, Marine and Maria. You take Marine under your care while your classmate Alessa takes the other one. While Alessa don't think of marionettes as anything more than a bunch of circuits pieced together, you experience tells you that's not true and you decide to prove her wrong by once again raising your marionette to a near-human form.<br><br>This visual novel comes with a typical interface for such adventure games, and also includes unlockable CG album, but aside from regular story dialogues your main focus in the game would be to construct and upgrade your marionette to act as close as humanly possible. You can teach her communication or you can focus on construction of her physique and functional processing. While you can change her appearance with different outfit or skin and hair color, that will not change her personality or the ability to reason or understand or act differently. For that you will need to acquire and install better CPU, mother board, cooler, generator and other such parts.",
