  "description": "Based on the Casper film, the game pits you in the role of the friendly ghost trying to make a friend and a second chance at life instead of scaring everyone away.<br><br>The plot centers around the &quot;spoiled, grasping inheritor of Whipstaff Manor&quot; - Carrigan Crittenden.  She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls.  Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.<br><br>Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare &quot;Fleshies&quot; and thwart Casper's efforts.  The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.",
