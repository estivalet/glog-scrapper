  "description": "<i>Chris Kamara's Street Soccer</i> is a five-a-side soccer game.<br><br>It boasts twenty teams, a choice of pitch, and five game modes:\n<ul>\n<li>Exhibition: A single match where the player(s) select the sides</li>\n<li>League: played with four, eight or sixteen teams</li>\n<li>Cup Tournament: a four, eight or sixteen team knockout game</li>\n<li>Time Attack: where the player wins if they score x goals within a time limit</li>\n<li>Arcade: where there are power moves available</li>\n<li>Penalty Shootout: here the game is decided by who scores the most penalties in a four shot shootout, if the game is tied then this will go to a sudden death mode.</li>\n</ul>\nDepending on the mode the player can alter the difficulty, the length of each half, and the strictness of the referee. There are twenty-five teams, five of which are locked at the start of the game. The teams are not licensed teams so the player selects a country's flag and gets a generic team, for example selecting Canada's flag brings up a Montreal team. <br>\nThe game starts with a dropped ball and from then on plays as any soccer game. The game auto-selects the player nearest the ball as the active player and their movement is controlled by the left joystick, kicking is controlled by CROSS - holding down CROSS triggers a power bar which adds pace to the shot. When a goal is scored the game restarts from a goal kick, goal kicks and throw-outs are the only time the player controls the keeper as all saving, or otherwise, is automatic.<br>\nThe game does have a commentary, it is not the flowing naturalistic commentary that is found in some games rather it is a set of standard phrases such as 'Hard Tackle!&quot;, &quot;What a Scorcher!&quot;, &quot;Good Shot!&quot; and &quot;Go On, Shoot!&quot;, that are triggered by in-game actions. As well as the standard phrases the game also has a couple of unexpected ones like &quot;What The Heck!&quot; and &quot;Punch Him!&quot;.",
