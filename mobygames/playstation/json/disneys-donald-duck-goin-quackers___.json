  "description": "<i>Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers</i> for PlayStation is based heavily on the version on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/disneys-donald-duck-goin-quackers\">Dreamcast/Nintendo 64</a>, but features new graphics, redesigned levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.<br><br>To save Daisy Duck from the evil sorcerer Merlock, Donald Duck must utilize Gyro Gearloose's teleporter. Due to a lack of power, the device can't teleport Donald to Merlock's temple (where Daisy is held) right away. Instead, Donald must successively install reflector dishes at high points at Duckie Mountain, Duckburg and the flying mansion of Magica De Spell before he can reach the temple.<br><br>The game is a platformer utilizing polygonal graphics, consisting of four worlds, each made up of four regular levels, one optional bonus level and one boss fight. In the regular levels the camera is either placed behind Donald as he runs forward, or at his side, thus emulating classical side-scrolling platform gameplay. In the bonus levels, Donald must flee from something (like a bear, a car, or a rolling boulder), with the camera placed in front of him and him running towards the screen.<br><br>In the regular levels, the main goal is simply to reach the exit. Doing so gives Donald a power orb: collecting all four of them per world is necessary before the boss fight level opens up. On his way to the exit, Donald must evade pits, traps and enemies. He can jump on top of or kick enemies to dispatch them. Scattered throughout the levels are stars in different colors: yellow stars are worth one, blue stars five, and red stars ten. Collecting 100 of them gains an extra life.<br><br>There are also several optional challenges: First, Merlock has stolen and enchanted the toys of Donald's nephews. In each regular level, Donald can find three toys. To pick them up, he first has to find one of Merlock's spell books. Picking one up starts a timer counting down the seconds Donald has to pick up the toy. Once all toys in a world are found, the nephews open up the bonus level. The second challenge involves Donald trying to beat his cousin Gladstone's time record. Once a level has been finished, Donald can try the level again, attempting to beat Gladstone's time. Beating the time challenges unlocks bonus costumes that Donald can wear.<br><br>At the end of each world lies a boss battle against the likes of the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell and of course Merlock himself. Following the classic formula, each boss attacks in a specific pattern that must be evaded and opens up to counter-attack only for a short time.<br><br>Some of the game's levels are based closely, others only loosely on those from the Dreamcast/N64 version, with most of Duckburg, two of the boss fights and all of the bonus levels being mostly or entirely new.",
