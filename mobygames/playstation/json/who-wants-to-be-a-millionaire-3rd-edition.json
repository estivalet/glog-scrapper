  "description": "<i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: 3rd Edition</i> is the third game based on the successful TV show. Not surprisingly the game itself is unchanged with the exception of new questions. The player takes the role of a candidate and has to answer 15 questions by choosing the correct answer out of four given possibilities. <br><br>For every right answer he receives money but he also loses money when choosing poorly (there are two &quot;guarantee points&quot;  where he falls back to so he doesn't lose all). There are also three jokers: eliminating two false answers, asking the viewers in the studio per poll and phoning a friend. In the game the latter is a prerecorded conversation.<br><br>The multiplayer mode is restricted to &quot;Fastest Finger&quot; competition where the next candidate is chosen. Here the players have to bring the four given answers into the right order and the fastest one wins. More questions are downloadable through the internet.",
