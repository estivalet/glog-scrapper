  "description": "This is a 3D kids action-adventure based on the Disney animated movie. You take turns controlling Stitch, the cute alien experiment that can turn deadly, to avoid the bounty hunters looking for him and Lilo, the Hawaiian girl being raised by her older sister, to use her voodoo magic to scare enemies throughout levels in various parts of the island.  <br><br>There are varied enemies, ranging from a turtle to man-eating plants to alien bounty hunters.  There are three sections of five levels each and Lilo &amp; Stitch must navigate various moving platforms. Both characters can run, jump and butt-stomp, along with some unique moves of their own.  As they progress, 100 tokens and 4 special icons must be collected in each level as well as different power-ups, health and lives. The items will be found on the ground, in breakable pots or high in the air which require jumping around on platforms to get.  There's also a few mini-games like a timed race against an opponent.  Hidden photos and movie clips are bonuses to be revealed between levels.",
