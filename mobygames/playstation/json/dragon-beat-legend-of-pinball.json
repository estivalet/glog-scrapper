  "description": "<i>Dragon Beat</i> serves up three realistic, pseudo 3D, single-screen pinball tables. Even with the small playfields you are treated to multi-ball play, extra flippers on some tables and the feel of a real pinball machine. The playfields are Castle which offers multiple ramps and targets, the surprisingly modern looking Old Town, and the jungle-themed Legend. The manual is written entirely in Japanese but all of the game and option screens are in English.",
