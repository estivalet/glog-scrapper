As in the other two cases, the graphics of the remade version have been redone from scratch, to match the 2D standard of 32-bit generation consoles. Interior locations are much more detailed, with visible furniture and other items in rooms that were empty or contains just a few objects in the original version.<br><br>The 3D dungeons can now be navigated with smooth scrolling, unlike the &quot;jumping&quot; navigation of the earlier versions. The remake also has an additional difficulty level, dubbed &quot;normal&quot;; the original difficulty level is called &quot;hard&quot;. The easier difficulty level also reduces the amount of random battles. Story, dialogues, layout of locations, and general gameplay remain unchanged in this version. ",
