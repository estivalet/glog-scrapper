(Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed. There is no story mode.",
