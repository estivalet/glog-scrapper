They are always the same story that everyone may have heard with the same endings. . . However, giving some funny changes and arrangement with new development is what you can do in this game! It's not just original characters who enter the scene. Other characters come from other stories and cross over in the same world!  Like Urashima Taro bumping into Momotaro. Not only that, other characters from other many stories among old tales form unusual connections in many location with variety. It is possible to change to other character's viewpoints and it is possible to reach multiple variations of the story  ending. This game overturns the established concept that there is only one ending to one story!<br><br><br><b>?PS3™ HDD and Memory Stick Duo™ capacity requirement</b><br>60MB<br><br><br><b>?Copyright notices</b><br>©1996 IDEA FACTORY<br><br><br><b>?Attention</b><br>This software is converted from the software for PlayStation® so that it can be played on PS3™ and PSP®.<br> Please note that there may be some functions that cannot be used due to the difference of hardware,<br> and that the software may not operate in the same manner when it is played with PSP®.<br>One time fee for use or downloads on up to 2 console systems and 2 portable systems that are compatible with the content and associated with the purchasing account. <br>",
