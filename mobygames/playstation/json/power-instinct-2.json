It is a 2D one-on-one fighting game in which you take your pick from the available characters and attempt to defeat all other opponents in combat for the title of ruler of the Gouketsuji clan.<br><br>The sequel features improved graphics and music (taking advantage of CD audio), new characters and additional gameplay mechanics, such as a power bar that gets charged as you perform special moves and allows you to unleash &quot;super&quot; moves as well as increase your speed and strength for a few moments.
