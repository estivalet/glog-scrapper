  "description": "Plucky, Hamton and Furball from the television cartoon <i>Tiny Toon Adventures</i> need to escape from the spooky haunted mansion of the evil Baroness Toonenstein (played by Elmyra) where she needs their brains to build a monster. The player moves Furball through numerous rooms looking for power cell actuators needed to activate the elevators on five floors while chased by different types of evil flying Bombats which explode if they touch him.  <br><br>When the Bombat Disabler Gun is found, the view changes to a stationary sniper mode and enemies can be shot with green goo.  Furball can also open doors, activate levers, and take items such as codes to a treasure vault in the basement. There are different mini-games and puzzles to solve, in order to progress.  Plucky and Hamton will sometimes be too frightened and run away, and must be located.",
