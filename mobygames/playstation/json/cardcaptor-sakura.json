The cards scattered across Tokyo, and the Guardian Beast of the Seal, Kerberos, has put her in charge of gathering the cards back up.<br><br>The birth of a Cardcaptor, Sakura Kinomoto! Now Sakura must locate all of the cards, aided by Kerberos, her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, and a mysterious boy from Hong Kong named Shaoran Li. Together, the four must find all the cards before chaos is unleashed on the world!<br><br><i>Cardcaptor Sakura</i> is a very simple adventure game. Typically, the player navigates Sakura on a very brief and linear path, until a mini-game and/or an anime-style cutscene takes place. The mini-games are quite simple as well, usually involving timed sequences and patterns.",
