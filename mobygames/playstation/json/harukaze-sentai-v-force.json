  "description": "Long ago, civilization flourished on Venus. The environmental protection agency Goa Del maintained the planet. However, in the name of self-defense, Goa Del began to develop weaponry against the wishes of the house of lords, El Doral, and eventually war broke out between the two groups. The queen of El Doral sent her young daughter Rabis on a shuttle to Earth, but in an attack, the shuttle was separated from the convoy and made an emergency landing on the moon. In a last-ditch effort, El Doral brought the way to an end with the &quot;organic weapon&quot; HN-01, and the defeated Goa Del fled into the reaches of space.<br><br>Two thousand years later, the descendants of Goa Del, now calling themselves the Baskille Empire, are rapidly expanding their power. One day, a bright light appears near Venus, and the Baskille Empire has appeared, returning to take back their planet. And now, three sisters living on Earth, distant descendants of El Doral, have gotten caught up in the fight.<br><br><i>Harukaze Sentai V-Force</i> is an isometric strategy RPG similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Front+Mission+series\">Front Mission</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Super+Robot+Taisen+series\">Super Robot Taisen</a>. The game follows Natsuki, Mizuki, and Kagetsu, three sisters who are pilots in the Earth Defense Force. Each mission allows you to configure your character's weaponry, and as they fight, they will gain experience and level up. Before and after each mission, fully-animated cutscenes drive the plot forward, and sometimes they will appear at crucial points during a mission as well.",
