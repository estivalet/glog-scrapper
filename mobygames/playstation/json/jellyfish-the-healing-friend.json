After picking their character, players bring their new jellies home and get started taking care of them. Detailed 3D jellyfish float freely in their tank, presented at a gentle pace with relaxing (&quot;healing&quot;) music by Japanese band Gontiti. Players are given a wide variety of different ways to take care of their jellyfish, including feeding and other standard care techniques, and are able to breed their jellyfish over a long period of time.",
