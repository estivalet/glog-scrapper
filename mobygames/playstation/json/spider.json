He must move through various environments to locate the intruders who have stolen his research and his body.  The player can move forward and back as well as jump. He can also move up and down walls as well as replace certain legs with power-ups like flamethrowers.  Other cybernetic creatures that were released during the break-in are some of the hazards he will encounter.",
