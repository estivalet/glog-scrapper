  "description": "<i>Hello Kitty Bowling</i> is a bowling game featuring the feline Sanrio mascot. It can be played either as normal 10-pin bowling or in a Quest Mode, which follows a story and has different pin setups for the different stages. It can be played alone or with up to three other people against each other.<br><br>When bowling, the player has the option to set the power with up and down on the controller. The player can also walk side to side with left and right and change the angle the player is in with the L1 and R1 buttons. After setting everything, the player has to time shots with a red bar that goes back and forth across the screen. If the player does not time it well, the player will most likely end up with a gutterball instead of a clean hit.",
