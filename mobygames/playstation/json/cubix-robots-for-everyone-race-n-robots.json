  "description": "<i>Cubix: Robots for Everyone - Race 'n Robots</i> is a racing game based on the Korean television series of the same name. The story is that Bubble Town's high-octane racing championships are about to begin, and every robot wants to be the ultimate racing champion of Bubble Town. You can choose from four robots at the beginning, including Cubix, and unlock more robots as you play the game. There are three modes, Story mode, Versus mode, and Coin Race. Certain shortcuts, like jumping over fences, are illegal, and will send you back to the track, making you lose time. <br><br>Story Mode has you entering into cups to win 1st place and unlock new robots. There are three laps on each race. To win, you must get 1st place in a certain amount of races. Points are awarded for each race, and can be spent at the Botties Pit for upgrades. In Versus mode, you can play the Story mode tracks with friends. If one player is too far behind, a point is taken away from their score. You can also play tracks on your own in Versus mode. In Coin Race, you must collect as many coins as possible on the race track. You don't even have to get first.",
