  "description": "<i>Missland 2</i> is a simple &quot;spot the differences&quot; game. Just like the first title, the player is given a view of two slightly different 3D environments, and can freely look around and zoom the camera. The player must find all eight differences in the stage, randomized each time it is played, before the time runs out and without making too many mistakes. In the party mode, up to four players can play simultaneously.",
