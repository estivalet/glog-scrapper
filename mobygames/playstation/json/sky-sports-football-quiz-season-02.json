Up to four players can participate in one of four games; League Championship where you manage a team which results depend on your answers across a full season; 'hit or miss' the right answers will go you through the Penalty Shootout game; two-player Man of the Match is a head-to-head battle where speed matters and scores goals; and finally building your own dream eleven with the money you win at the Dream Team game. All games feature Sky Sport's Kirsty Gallagher as the host.",
