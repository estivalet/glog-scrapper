  "description": "<i>Mobile Suit Gundam 2.0</i> is an upgraded do-over of the previous PlayStation game based on the original anime's storyline, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/mobile-suit-gundam\">Mobile Suit Gundam</a>. This version retains the same storyline, first-person cockpit perspective, and control scheme, but has upgraded the experience across the board. 3D objects now appear in stages, such as White Base in space missions or buildings in the fight for Jaburo. All the stages in the game are newly designed; omitting some encounters from the first game but in general telling more of the original <i>Gundam</i> story, such as Garma Zabi's final attack. All FMV in the game is newly made and higher detailed, and the cockpit has been redesigned to make health, ammo, and the radar easier to read.<br><br>In addition to the story mode the game also includes two new modes: Time Attack and VS U.N.T.SPACY Mode. All story mode missions can be attempted in Time Attack mode, and the game saves the player's best completion time. In VS U.N.T.SPACY Mode the player takes control of either Char's Custom Zaku II or Char's Custom Gelgoog and attempts to shoot down Amuro. The best times for this mode are also saved.",
