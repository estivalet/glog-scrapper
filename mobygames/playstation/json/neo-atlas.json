You can discover mysterious plots, cities, ruins, creatures, pirates, monsters and additional background music on your journeys.<br><br>Whilst your admirals are out exploring, you are also charged with establishing trade routes to distribute the resources they've uncovered, enable the production of goods, and ultimately make yourself a tidy profit.",
