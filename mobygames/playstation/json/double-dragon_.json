  "description": "Released around the same time as the film of the same name and loosely based on its story, this installment in the Double Dragon series <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/double-dragon-v-the-shadow-falls\">also</a> moves away from the traditional roam-the-streets-fighting to a pure one-on-one fighter. There are ten characters to choose from, including Billy and Jimmy and the game has colorful interactive backgrounds, screen zooming, over-the-top special moves and with the inclusion of double jumps, combos, charges for the losing player and counter hits, there is plenty of room for advanced fighting strategies.",
