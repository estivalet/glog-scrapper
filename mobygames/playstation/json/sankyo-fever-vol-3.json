  "description": "<i>Sankyo Fever Vol. 3</i> is a single player simulation of five Pachinko machines from Sankyo. These are:<ul><li>CR Fever Powerful EX</li><li>CR Fever Powerful FX</li><li>Fever Mega Queen EX</li><li>CR Fever Daemon GP</li><li>Fever Daemon GX</li></ul>\nPachinko is sometimes referred to as the number one pastime in Japan, and it is played in gaming halls called parlor's. Gambling for money is illegal in Japan so players purchase steel balls with which they play the game. At the end of their session they exchange their remaining balls for tokens which, in turn, can be exchanged for goods / prizes. \n",
