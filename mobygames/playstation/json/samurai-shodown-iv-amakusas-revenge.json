  "description": "Bringing a new breath to SNK's swordsman fighting series, this 4th installment marks the return of 3 classic characters (Yagyu Jubei, Charlotte and Tam Tam, now with updated stuff), introduces 2 newcomers for the pantheon (the brothers Sogetsu Kazama and Kazuki Kazama) and brings some new backgrounds.<br><br>In spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/samurai-shodown-iii-blades-of-blood\">Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood</a>) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively).<br><br>With the intention to provide more action in the battles, the &quot;No Contest&quot; Moves were introduced: working in similar way (and under certain conditions) to the many games of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game_group/sheet/gameGroupId,87/\">Mortal Kombat Series</a>, your fighter will execute an ultimate-slaughter move in a stunned opponent.",
