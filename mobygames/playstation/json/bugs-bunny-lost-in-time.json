  "description": "On his way to the beach, Bugs Bunny accidentally finds and activates a time machine. Bugs Bunny is immediately propelled through five different areas in time and must find his way back to the present.\nIt won't be an easy task, because blocking  his way back to the present are some of the wildest troublemakers (Stupid Villians) he has ever known like Elmer Fudd, Witch Haxel, Yosemite Sam, Rocky and Marvin.<br><br><i>Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time</i> is a 3D platformer. Stages do not succeed each other linearly, but can be accessed in different order by collecting clocks and golden carrots. Bugs Bunny must dispose of regular enemies and bosses along his way. There are also a few racing and chase segments.",
