  "description": "<i>Brightis</i> is a 3D action-RPG where the player travel the land and head into dungeons as the sword-wielding Al Ted, searching for the four stones needed to reseal an evil gate that's unleashed demons into the world. <br><br>The player has to solve puzzles, fight enemies, jump across platforms, and navigate dungeons and traps much like other examples in this genre. This game's unique gimmick is that you are the embodiment of light, and can cast light down dark hallways in order to see enemies and traps. Light is represented through the pulsing blue orb just below your HP, functioning as an MP meter that slowly refills automatically.",
