  "description": "<i>Jigsaw Island</i> is a jigsaw puzzle game, and the third title in Nippon Ichi's jigsaw series. As in <i>Jigsaw Party</i> and <i>Jigsaw World</i>, it combines the jigsaw puzzle with elements of arcade puzzle games, tasking two players (or a player and the computer) with solving a set of puzzles as quickly as possible. Pieces are supplied to each player in a specific order, and there are also power-ups that can be used to hinder the other player.<br><br>The main story mode follows two young girls from the Japonese Kingdom, Asuka and Akira, as they try to improve their rank at their school's Puzzle Association, battling against other students and eventually teachers. There are also two different battle modes for up to four players.<br><br>In addition to the battle modes, there is also a regular puzzle mode for one player. There are 150 puzzles total, including both photographs and illustrations, each of which can be played as either a 24, 96, or 150 piece puzzle.<br><br>The international release, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jigsaw-madness\">Jigsaw Madness</a>, removed the story mode, leaving only the battle and solo modes.",
