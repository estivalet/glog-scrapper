  "description": "The Mission’, offers gamers the opportunity to play as some of the greatest footballers in the world.\nThe aim of the game is to rescue a 'Geo Merlin’' ball, which has been stolen by Ninjas who embody the forces of brutality and poor sportsmanship, to save the future of football in its purest form. Using a selected team of two footballers, the player must battle and puzzle his way through over 24 levels of action, dispensing with fire-spitting demons and innumerable Ninjas trained in the martial arts along the way.\nContains a mix of elements from football, action and combat games.",
