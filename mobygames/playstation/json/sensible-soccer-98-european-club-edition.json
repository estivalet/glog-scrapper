The game now has all the club teams of Europe included, with many new features that have never been seen before.<br><br>Over 90% of all in-game graphics have been massively enhanced including all player models and textures and improved crowds and stadiums. The in-game animation system has been thoroughly tweaked for a much smoother overall look to the game. There's also a brilliant, new, stylish look to the even bigger and more comprehensive menu system. New close-up penalty shootouts in full 3D gameplay is more silky smooth than ever with improved aftertouch, much improved tackling, a burst of speed for defenders and the ability to wash whites at a much lower temperature. An improved in-game sound system lets you hear the sounds of the game more clearly. <br><br>Over 200 European Club Teams are included, all with accurate player skills, etc., from the English, Scottish, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Dutch and Belgian leagues.
