  "description": "The Dark Lord has been sealed away, but peace has not yet come to this world. A young woman named Chimena is traveling the world, seeking an ancient holy sword...<br><br><i>Blue Breaker Burst</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/blue-breaker-ken-yori-mo-hohoemi-o\">Blue Breaker</a>. However, instead of an RPG, this sequel is a full 3D 1-on-1 fighting game. The main story focuses on a new character named Chimena, though much of the first title's cast also return. The player moves Chimena around the world map to different locations, where visual novel-style events may occur with other characters, furthering the story and often leading to a fight. Apart from the main &quot;Chimena's Story&quot;, additional stories focusing on other characters are unlocked as the game progresses.<br><br>There are also a number of other modes. Original Mode is an arcade-style mode that forgoes the story in favor of a string of opponents that must be defeated. Versus mode allows a free battle against the computer or another player, while Training mode lets the player practice moves and combos, and view a moves list for each character.",
