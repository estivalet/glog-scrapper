  "description": "<i>Auto Destruct</i> involves mission-based car combat.  Unlike similar titles such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Destruction+Derby\">Destruction Derby</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Twisted+Metal\">Twisted Metal</a>, this doesn't focus on arena-type face-offs with multiple opponents.<br><br>Sometime in the near future, your family is killed by a mysterious cult.  You join an underground organization dedicated to annihilating this cult, and are outfitted with an armed car (customizable to an extent).  The 25 missions vary, from simple search-and-destroy rounds to escort missions and defense missions.",
