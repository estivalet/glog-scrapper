  "description": "<i>R/C Stunt Copter</i> is described by developer Shiny as more of a &quot;software toy&quot; than a video game. It's a Radio Controlled model flight simulation that fully utilizes the PlayStation analog controller. The player view is selectable as either stationary (as with a real R/C helicopter), walking or flying behind the helicopter.<br>\n<br>\n You can do training, stunts, complete mission objectives, multiplayer head-to-head, or free flight, using one of five different models of tiny helicopters in 3rd person view.<br>\n<br>\n The game starts a new player with an obligatory training section to teach you how the helicopter flies, in which you use a helicopter with a frame attached to prevent crashes and with limited maneuverability - no looping/rolls. Using this beginner model you are graded and may qualify for flying other more capable models than the trainer.\n Only after completing the training, you can fly stunts or do missions. Stunts include for example shooting at targets, flying through hoops, doing rolls and loops, and flying inverted.<br>\n<br>\n In the two-player competition mode you can shoot at your opponent's helicopter, and cause it to crash.<br>\n<br>\n All your flights are graded and also commented upon by an instructor, who will either over-enthusiastically applaud your success or sarcastically ridicule you for the often spectacular failures.<br>",
