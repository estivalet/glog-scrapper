  "description": "<i>Linda³ Again</i> is an enhanced remake of the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Linda%c2%b3\"> Linda³</a>.<br><br>The main story line in this version remains unchanged for the most part; however, many of the dialogues have been altered, and several characters modified and/or presented in a different way - which, naturally, also has an impact on the story. For example, a cut scene early in the game showed Linda and Ken kissing in the original version; in the remake, Linda punches him instead.<br><br>All the cut scenes have been re-done from scratch. Instead of the simple animated scenes of the original the remake features full-motion anime-style movies. The change is more than just technical, as illustrated by the example above.<br><br>In-game graphics have received a significant overhaul and are more detailed. Battle graphics in particular have been enhanced; in the original version, there were no backgrounds behind the enemy pictures; in this release, battle screens are accompanied by backgrounds reflecting the scenery the battle takes place in.<br><br>Gameplay changes were also made. In addition to mission objectives (which represented difficulty levels in the earlier version), <i>Linda³ Again</i> features four parallel levels of difficulty, involving battles against animals and their collection. Difficulty of the battles themselves was also re-done in many areas; different and/or additional enemies are seen wandering in places populated by other creatures in the original release.",
