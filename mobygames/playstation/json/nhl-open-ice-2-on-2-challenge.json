  "description": "<i>NHL Open Ice</i> is the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=NBA+Jam\">NBA Jam</a> for ice hockey, with a 2 on 2 arcade action featuring a full NHL license including actual team names and logos and 120 actual NHLPA players with reflective stats for the 1995-96 season.<br><br>The game features power-ups that will aid the players along during a game including the &quot;Hot Meter&quot; which is filled with every score, body check and steals.  Once the meter is full, the player will literally catch fire and their stats will max out for a brief period of time, allowing the player to score goals better, steal the puck more often, etc.<br><br>There is five difficulty settings and adjustable options such as period time times and cheat options such as &quot;Big Head&quot; mode and multiplayer capabilities for either head-to-head action or co-op play.  <i>Chicago Blackhawks</i> announcer, Pat Foley, lends his voice talents to the game for in-game commentary.",
