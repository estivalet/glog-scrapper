  "description": "<i>Tsurikichi Sanpei: The Tsuri</i> is a simple fishing game based on the manga by Takao Yaguchi.<br><br>Gameplay consists of first picking a fishing spot from which the action will take place. Each spot consists of a single screen where the player gets to aim where to try his luck. Once the float sits in the water the player has to wait for a fish to bite by watching a close-up picture where any bobs and nibbles can be seen. Once a fish bites, the player has to fight the fish until it's tired enough to give up. This is done by pulling the rod in the opposite direction of where the fish is swimming while keeping an eye on the line tension. If the line tension gets too high or low, the fish will get away. Once the fish's energy bar is sufficiently depleted, it gives up and can be reeled in.<br><br>The game can be played in two ways; Story Mode or Free Mode. Story Mode follows the main characters from the series through as series of events divided into chapters where fishing, of course, is at the center. Free Mode lets the player fish without the goal oriented story in the way.",
