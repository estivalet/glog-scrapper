  "description": "If you think it's a hassle to clean out the grill, marinate meat, watch it slowly get burned on the grill as it starts to rain outside... this might be the game for you. <i>Yakinikubugy?</i> puts you in the role of a BBQ chef, and it's your job to make sure the customers leave happy and full from your restaurant.<br><br>The goal of each stage in the game is to make sure you keep all 3 customers happy when the timer runs out by handing out the right food to the right person, while making sure it's not undercooked or burned to a black piece of coal. The customers each have a food they like and one they hate, and they can suddenly change their minds in the middle of a stage, so figuring out what they want to eat and when is the key to success. You can also earn combos by feeding the same customer several times in a row with food they like.<br><br>You use chop sticks to maneuver around a 3x4 squares big grill where you have to put down pieces of meat and vegetables and grill them to perfection. The closer to the middle of the grill you put the food, the faster it cooks, so if you have a customer yelling at you to hand him/her something, you can put the food there.<br><br>If you're too slow or forget about a piece of food, it slowly turns to coal and you have to tap it to clean the grate. Otherwise you won't be able to use that square again.<br><br>You can either play alone or against a friend. The game is sponsored by Gyu-Kaku, a chain of Japanese BBQ restaurants.",
