  "description": "<i>Eik? no St Andrews</i> (?????????????) is a golf game which focuses on the original course at St Andrews also known as the home of golf. Gameplay modes include training, stroke play, match play and tournament. Depending on the type of game, you can play against one or more players in turn or compete in match or tournament against CPU players. Character models include several professional golfers from that time, although a lot of things are adjustable, include character heights, player names and their hand preference.<br><br>Gameplay uses 3rd-person back camera and shows a swinging ellipse around the player character which indicates power of the swing, which once pressed will show red blip on the ball icon which will downsize red circle indicating precision with which you hit the ball, which also requires good timing to hit the ball in best possible way sending it off flying long distance. Each strike is indicated with a vector arc in different color so at any time in the game you can see your full trajectory from the starting point to your current position.<br><br>During the tournament, each hole has a brief overview introduction sequence shows the terrain all around with camera showing it from high altitude. The game also features live-action videos for each of the track. Those videos, along with town overview and foreword by an actor portraying Tom Morris, a 19th century golfer, can be accessed from the main menu. Various game data can be saved onto memory card such as scores and replays. The settings screen allows for change of the time of day, weather control (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and random), BGM and movies can be toggled on/off, and number of days for tournament can be set (between 1 and 4 days).<br><br><table class=\"techInfo\">\n<thead><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Course Guide</td></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Hole</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Par</th>\n<th>Distance (in yards)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The Burn</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>370</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>The Dyke</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>411</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Cartgate Out</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>352</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Ginger Beer</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>419</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Hole O'Cross Out</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>514</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Heathery Out</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>374</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>High Hole Out</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>359</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Short Hole</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>166</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>End Hole</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>307</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Bobby Jones</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>318</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>High Hole In</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>172</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Heathery In</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>316</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>Hole O'Cross In</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>398</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>Long Hole</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>523</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Cartgate In</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>401</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Corner of the Dyke</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>351</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>The Road Hole</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>461</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Tom Morris</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>354</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
