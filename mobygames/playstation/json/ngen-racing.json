Instead of a car, like in most racing games, you control a Fighter Jet Plane.<br><br>The game features two game modes: arcade and N.GEN. In the arcade mode you play a serious of championships. Winning a championship grants you access to a higher one. In N.GEN mode you start with a poor plane and have to earn money to upgrade it so you can participate in more challenging and more rewarding races. You can choose between arcade or professional controls.<br><br>The planes can shoot various weapons, such as missiles, rockets and guns at the opponents. There are 38 jets to fly in on 14 different tracks.<br><br>In Two player mode you can play Powerball. Here each player has to try and pick up the ball and score points by flying through drones.",
