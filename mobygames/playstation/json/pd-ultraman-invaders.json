  "description": "<i>PD Ultraman Invaders</i> is an updated remake of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> featuring a wide variety of heroes and villains from the numerous <i>Ultraman</i> television series produced over the years, rendered in a cartoony SD style. In addition to the original Ultraman, there are also appearances from Ultra Seven, Ultraman Ace, Ultraman Taro, and many others.<br><br>Gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the original title. Waves of enemies slowly advance toward the player, who shoots at them from the bottom of the screen behind a number of defense posts. The action can be viewed from either a pseudo-3D perspective behind Ultraman's back, or the standard top-down view. There are also special attacks available, which differ depending on which character is currently in the action. There is also a version of the original <i>Space Invaders</i> included.",
