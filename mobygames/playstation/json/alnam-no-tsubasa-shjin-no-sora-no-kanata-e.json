The world of Alnam needed a long time to recover from the dreadful cataclysm that left its mark on it forever.

A fourteen-year-old orphan named Kusumida becomes involved in the grand struggle and must put an end to the Duke's plans before it is too late.<br><br><i>Alnam no Tsubasa</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/turbografx-cd/alnam-no-kiba-jzoku-jnishinto-densetsu_\">Alnam no Kiba</a>. Like its predecessor, it is a Japanese-style role-playing game with a character-driven story, linear advancement, and simple leveling-up. Combat is turn based, with up to four player-controlled characters forming a party. Characters can attack physically, cast spells, or execute special attacks that take up a part of a corresponding gauge. Magic is learned by receiving magic points for winning battles and using them to create various spells. The game features 3D background graphics with 2D sprites representing characters.",
