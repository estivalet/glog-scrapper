  "description": "A home version of the popular TV show, where playing as one of the 24 selectable characters you will have to answer questions, bank prize money and vote tactically to become the winner.  <br><br>Questions are presented in a multiple choice format with only the first letter of the answers displayed. Difficulty settings can be changed so that all the answers are shown fully, or for the Junior setting there is only a choice of 2 answers.<br><br>The game supports single and multiplayer options for the main game plus there is a longer single player championship mode where you must play and win 4 shows to succeed. <br><br>The game faithfully creates the TV studio setting and features video and sound clips of host Anne Robinson for an authentic Weakest Link experience.<br><br>",
