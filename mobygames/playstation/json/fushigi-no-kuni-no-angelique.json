  "description": "This game is a variation on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/angelique\"> Angelique</a> story: an ordinary school girl named Angelique becomes involved in a struggle to become the Queen of Cosmos, for which it is necessary to befriend the handsome and powerful Guardians of the Elements. The game features the same world and graphics as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/angelique-special\"> Angelique Special</a>, with a slightly different story: Angelique falls asleep outside near a tree, and dreams that she fell through a rabbit hole (in an <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> fashion) into the magical land where she encounters her eternal rival Rosalia.<br><br>Unlike other Angelique games, <i>Fushigi no Kuni no Angelique</i> plays like a board game, with the kingdom divided into fields on which Angelique moves. There are no visible dice, but the amount of fields Angelique can walk on is determined randomly by clicking on the &quot;move&quot; button. Fields can either be empty, placed inside a location (like Angelique's own room), trigger events, conversations, etc. In some places it is possible to find items, which can then be used on another field to help Angelique advance more quickly, increasing her chances to become the queen.",
