  "description": "<i>Double Cast</i> is the first of four Yaru Dora (????) interactive anime dramas that play as an actual move with player's choice branching the story. The game uses full-motion video during gameplay and pauses and shows subtitle only when player's character is talking (text-only, no voice for main character) prompting the player to press the button to continue, similar to visual novel concept. Same as was the case with the other four Yaru Dora games released for PlayStation, this game too was later ported to PSP with some some graphical enhancement and newly included CG gallery.<br><br>The story follows a high-school male protagonist who wakes up at the fountain next to a pretty girl who just helped him out of the garbage where you passed out drunk. The girl seems to have an amnesia, and only thing she remembers is her name, Mitsuki. Until she remembers who she is or where she lives, you offer her to stay at your place. As it turns out, a female lead role is needed for a movie project at your movie club, and Mitsuki auditions for it. Despite her jealous twitching eyebrow, the manager of the movie club caved in to all the guys that were mesmerized by Mitsuki's appearance. But as the time passed, something strange started to happen around Mitsuki. At first it seemed like an accident, but it was soon clear someone was out to get her and whoever that was, he was not happy with you being in her life either. Was there a stalker? Was there something in Mitsuki's past that is coming to haunt her? The game turns into a suspenseful thriller as she struggles to remember her past and unlock the secret behind it.",
