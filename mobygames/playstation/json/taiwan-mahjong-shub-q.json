  "description": "<i>Taiwan Mahjong Sh?ubù Q?</i> is a mahjong simulation which follows traditional Taiwanese rules. Unlike most other variants, which traditionally feature hands of 13 tiles, Taiwanese rules notably feature hands of 16 tiles and this rule is prominently featured in this game. <br><br>The focus of this game is its tournament mode which pits the player against a large number of simulated opponents. The outcomes of all of the games are simulated, not just the player character, with AI players also being eliminated or rising in the ranks as appropriate. A single match mode is also available, and players can choose any three AI players to play against in this mode. Players are also given a detailed set of several dozen rule options to tweak gameplay to their liking.",
