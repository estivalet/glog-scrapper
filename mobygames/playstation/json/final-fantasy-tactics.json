  "description": "<i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> was a big move for the whole <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Final%2bFantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during the Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.<br><br>In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled &quot;guests&quot; with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to nearly endless combinations.<br><br>The PSP version of the game mostly reiterates the original for the PSOne. Visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy, looking like the old version with a zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. Port developer Tose added cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.<br><br>Also the PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/final-fantasy-xii\">Final Fantasy XII</a> and Luso from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift\">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a>. Two new job classes have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you've reached the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team mission).",
