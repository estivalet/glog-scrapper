  "description": "<i>pop'n music 5</i> is one of the many titles in Konami's long-running rhythm game franchise. Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen along nine tracks, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the &quot;groove meter&quot; increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.<br><br>This release includes all of the music from the arcade version, along with several tracks and modes from the arcade version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/popn-music-6\">pop'n music 6</a>, which had already been released. It also functions as a Key Disc for the Append Disc releases in the series, much like Konami's other Bemani franchises.",
