  "description": "<i>Little Princess: Marl ?koku no Ningy? Hime 2</i>, also known as <i>Little Princess: The Puppet Princess of Marl Kingdom 2</i>, is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Rhapsody%3a+A+Musical+Adventure\">Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</a>. Unlike its predecessor, Little Princess uses a more traditional RPG battle system, but it still contains many of the same themes of love and music.<br><br><i>Little Princess</i> takes place years after the events of <i>Rhapsody</i>, where the protagonists of the previous game have settled down as the rulers of Marl Kingdom and now have a daughter, Kururu. Kururu gets entangled in a dispute between two families of witches, and must track down the pieces of a shattered gem.<br><br>The battles follow a standard RPG battle system of enemies on the opposite side of the screen from the players and commands selected from a text menu. However, two of the characters have companion &quot;puppets&quot; that cast magic for them. The puppets level up along with the characters, and when a spell is cast, money is taken instead of magic points.<br><br>The game was released twice; the first included a bonus disc of illustrations and a sound test, the second was a budget release.",
