  "description": "<i>Three Wonders</i> contains three different games: <i>Midnight Wanderers</i> (side-scrolling action), <i>Chariot</i> (shoot-em-up) and <i>Don't Pull</i> (puzzle).<br><br><b>Midnight Wanderers: Quest for the Chariot</b><br><br><i>Midnight Wanderers</i>  (<i>Roosters</i> in the Japanese version) is a run-and-gun game. The player walks along side-scrolling stages while shooting enemies with a bow. The player can grab power-ups such as stronger shot, or a companion that follows the avatar and shoots. The gameplay is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=ghosts-n-goblins\">Ghosts 'N Goblins</a>, made by the same developer. If the avatar gets hit he loses his clothes and will walk in his underwear in the same way.<br><br><b>Chariot: Adventure Through The Sky</b><br><br><i>Chariot</i> is a shoot-em-up similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gradius\">Gradius</a>. The player shoot enemies on a vertically scrolling screen, collect power-ups and fight end bosses. The player collects power-ups such as three-way shot, stronger laser, extra points, bombs and shields. If the player picks up extra bombs, they attach to his or her ship like a tail. The end bosses are themed after the classic elements, like the wind, the Moon, the sun, etc.<br><br><b>Don't Pull</b><br><br><i>Don't Pull</i> is essentially a polished and updated version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=pengo\">Pengo</a>. In this single screen game, the player plays as a bunny or chipmunk walking through a maze full of baddies. The player can push the blocks of the maze to crush the enemies.<br><br>If a tile that is pushed is blocked by another tile, it is crushed and clears the way through the maze. There also are special blocks, for example a block with a bomb icon, that explodes and stuns any nearby enemies. Bonus points are earned for crushing multiple enemies with a single block push.",
