  "description": "<i>Barbapapa</i> is an educational game featuring the shape shifting family for younger children.<br><br>The game consists of seven different games which all focus on different creative and learning activities. Each of the seven Barbababies host a game featuring their favorite things;\n<ul>\n<li>Barbazoo (yellow): Loves nature and animals. His game is a side scrolling game where he collects apples, avoids spiky balls falling from trees as well as bees and badgers.\n<li>Barbalala (green): Loves music. Her game lets the player pick up to three different instruments, which will correspond to one of three buttons on the controller (+ vocals on a fourth). Then the player can play music live using the set instruments.\n<li>Barbalib (orange): Loves books. In her game she shape shifts into an item, and using her shape as a clue, the player will have to assemble a 4 piece puzzle (each piece has 3 alternatives).\n<li>Barbabeau (black and furry): Loves art. In his game the player gets to pick between Barbapapa and Barbamama to use as a model for a picture. Then the player gets to pick any of three shapes to turn them into, as well as a background picture. Barbabeau will then paint a picture using the selected choices made by the player.\n<li>Barbabelle (purple): Loves beauty. Her game has the player identify items by choosing the corresponding word out of three alternatives.\n<li>Barbabright (blue): Loves science. In his game he turns into an airplane in a ravine, and the player has to help control him to gather balloons while avoiding vultures. The game scrolls &quot;into&quot; the screen and the plane is seen from behind.\n<li>Barbabravo (red): Loves bravery and heroism. His game is a snowball fight where four of his siblings have turned into fortresses with button symbols underneath. When Barbabravo peeks up from behind one, the player presses the corresponding button to throw a snowball at him to get points. If the family dog peeks out, however, the player has to avoid throwing or he/she will get a point deducted from the score.\n</ul><br><br>The game was developed for use with the Kids Station peripheral. If played with a standard controller, it makes exclusive use of the face buttons (square, triangle, X and circle).\n",
