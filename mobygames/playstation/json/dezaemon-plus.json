  "description": "<i>Dezaemon Plus</i> is an updated PlayStation release of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?platform=SNES\">Dezaemon</a> on the Super Famicom.  Both games allow players to create their own vertical shooters through use of an icon-driven tool set.  Players can control enemy placement, behavior, weapons, powerups, boss firing points, and so on.  A graphics editor allows players to draw backgrounds, along with sprites for players, enemies, and even explosions.  A music editor, very similar to the one in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mario-paint\">Mario Paint</a> allows players to construct background themes for each level.  Players are limited to a maximum of five levels, and a limited amount of shared memory for all graphics.<br><br><i>Dezaemon Plus</i>'s changes primarily include parallax scrolling for enemy sprites and backgrounds, and a selection of new or altered instruments in the music editor.  Players can save their creations to a memory card and share them with friends.  The game also supports the PlayStation mouse, making graphics editing a little easier.<br><br><i>Dezaemon Plus</i> also contains an updated version of the Super Famicom's demo game <i>Daioh Gale</i> (which players can use as a template for editing), as well as submissions from two editing contests held by Athena.  13 winners and runner-ups are included, 9 of which are fully playable.  The remaining submissions are included as gameplay videos.  All submissions were created using the <i>Dezaemon</i> tools, giving players some ideas of what they can create with them.<br><br>The game was released on the PlayStation Network in Japan, and as a &quot;PSOne Classics Japanese import&quot; (so menus are untranslated) in the U.S. and Europe.  The game does not feature USB mouse support or analogue controls, making image editing somewhat difficult.  However, created games can be copied to PlayStation Memory Sticks and shared. ",
