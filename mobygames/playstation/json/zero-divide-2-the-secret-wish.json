  "description": "XTAL has been defeated and the hackers responsible rounded up. However, the leader of the hackers reveals that the group have also unleashed a second artificial intelligence into the data library, known as EVE. The player must take control of one of EVE's attack programs and use them to destroy the other guard programs and then EVE herself.<br><br><i>Zero Divide 2: The Secret Wish</i> is a sequel to the robot fighting game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zero-divide\">Zero Divide</a>. The game features higher resolution graphics and more detailed character models. It adds two new robots, the nurse-like Pixel and the crab-like Cancer, along with a few new bosses and hidden characters. It also adds various new arena types of different shapes (the original game only had standard square arenas), including completely walled-in ones, as well as arenas with low barriers that the opponent can be juggled over to lead to a ring out. Rounds are now considerably shorter, and the robot's armour easier to knock off. ",
