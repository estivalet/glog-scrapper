  "description": "<i>Sheep</i> is a sheep herding game. Unbeknownst to most people, sheep are actually aliens that were sent to observe the earth millions of years ago.  In the process, they were dumbed down to the sheepish mammals we all know and love today. <br><br>In this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Lemmings\">Lemmings</a>-inspired game, your goal is to herd sheep across 28 hazard-filled levels so they can be rescued by their educated alien cousins. You play as one of the four sheep herders. These are the humans and dogs Bo Pee, Adem Halfpint, Motly and Shep. You herd four breeds of sheep and have to protect them from the evil mr. Pear.",
