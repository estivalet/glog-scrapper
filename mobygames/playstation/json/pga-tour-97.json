Game modes include letting the player practice a round of golf, compete in a tournament, have a shoot-out, or compete in a Skins game.<br><br>The game features two 18 hole golf courses to play at. Both platform versions of this game include the Sawgrass golf course, with each also including a unique golf course of their own. The Playstation version includes the Spanish Bay links, while the Saturn version includes the Spyglass Hill course.<br><br>When on the course, player select what club they want to use. They also can set the angle, pitch and backspin of the ball before taking a swing.\nThey then have to aim where they want their shot to go. When shooting, players have to contend with the &quot;Target Arc&quot; power bar interface which effects the velocity and accuracy of each shot. This meter also factors the players risk in their shot by determining the degree of difficulty it would be to make the shot. Bold shots get rewarded while risky shots are not.<br><br>The game also features TV style commentary and several different camera angles, including a picture in picture view.",
