  "description": "<i>C: Contra Adventure</i> is a sequel to some of Konami's earlier Contra classics. <br><br>The game's story follows the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/contra-legacy-of-war\">Contra: Legacy of War</a>. It follows Ray, the only surviving member of the Contra task force (who is originally from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Contra%3a+Hard+Corps\">Contra: Hard Corps</a>), fighting an alien invasion in the jungles of South America.<br><br>All the innovations that were introduced in <i>Contra: Legacy of War</i> are maintained in this game: memory card saving, hit-points, three-dimensional fire fights. However, the gameplay varies depending on the level and perspective used.<br><br>The nine levels are a combination of mostly overhead with some side scrolling, and third person 3D.  For a different twist in one of the levels your character is weightless.<br><br>City Rescue - sidescrolling \nVillage - third-person 3-d \nCanyon - overhead \nPyramid - third-person 3-d\nWeightless - Sidescrolling\nHunting - third-person 3-d \nAlien Lair - sidescrolling <br><br>The weapons are the standard laser, machine gun and spread weapon.
