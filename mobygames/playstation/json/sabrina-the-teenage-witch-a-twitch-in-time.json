  "description": "In this 3D action-adventure, Sabrina's cat, Salem, accidentally breaks the Cosmic Clock. Unlike normal clocks, this one not only imprisons Chaos, but keeps history stable. (You'd think they'd secure it better.) Now, it's up to Sabrina to find and recover the pieces of the clock, and stop Chaos.<br><br>Gameplay should be familiar; run and jump through each of the 4 time periods (there are multiple levels in each time period, and not all areas are visitable the first time through), cast spells at the many enemies you encounter, and collect items. Redeem gems to buy new outfits, which allow you to visit new areas, and replace misplaced items to open new paths.",
