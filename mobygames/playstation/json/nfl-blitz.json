  "description": "<i>NFL Blitz</i> gives the National Football League the same over-the-top treatment that Midway had used so effectively with NBA Jam.  Features include exaggerated muscle-bound player models, &quot;turbo&quot; buttons, fast action, and some pretty wild rules changes (like 30 yards for a first down!). Blitz is nothing if not a unique football gaming experience.<br><br>Player taunts (&quot;This is MY HOUSE!&quot;), unpenalized late hits, and amusing running commentary from the announcers (&quot;That was totally uncalled for -- but awfully fun to watch!&quot;) all add to the game's violent charm.\n",
