  "description": "<i>Arkanoid Returns</i> is the fourth game in the <i>Arkanoid</i> series. It is largely similar to its predecessor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arkanoid-doh-it-again\">Arkanoid: Doh It Again</a> as it has the same power-ups (plus the Giga-Ball) and board size. Some of the level designs have even been reused. The game has 50 levels, and the theme changes every 9 levels. Unlike past games, it doesn't have any boss battles.",
