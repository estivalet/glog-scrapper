  "description": "A console version of <i>Backyard Soccer</i> based on  <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/backyard-soccer-mls-edition\">the MLS Edition</a> minus the MLS license, the game mechanics mostly follow that of the computer versions -- pick a field, pick a team name and colors, and choose who you want to be on your team. You may also play through a season. <br><br>Although it may sound like the same game, the ball physics and player movement is entirely different from the PC/Macintosh versions. It can be seen as less realistic; the players and ball move far more stiffly than in the computer versions.",
