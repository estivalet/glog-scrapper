  "description": "In a grim, dystopian future, the World Destruction League has become the prime source of entertainment. Television crew is following the participants as they travel across the world, competing in just what the league's name implies: destruction. With their heavily armed tanks, the combatants do not just destroy each other: they lay waste to everything around them...<br><br><i>World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks</i> is a tank combat game that has similarities with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=BattleTanx\">BattleTanx</a> games, as well as vehicular combat titles in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Twisted+metal\">Twisted Metal</a>. Single-player gameplay consists of a tournament mode, in which the player selects a tank and takes it through a series of combat matches. The game's focus, however, is on the multiplayer, which includes different modes: deathmatch, capture-the-flag, frenzy, (a capture-the-flag variant with randomly appearing flags), as well as a so-called &quot;domination mode&quot;, in which players must capture several tank generators scattered across the arena. Up to four players can compete in each of the multiplayer modes. <br><br>Various power-ups can be picked up on the arenas. These include turbo boosts, shields, fire missiles, grenades, mines, artillery and satellite strike (which allow players to target a specific spot on the arena and bombard it with missiles or a focused ion cannon blast), as well as guided missiles, which can be steered through the arena.",
