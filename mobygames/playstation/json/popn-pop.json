  "description": "<i>Pop'n Pop</i> is a puzzle game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=puzzle+bobble\">Puzzle Bobble</a>; the player's goal is to release colored bubbles from the bottom on the screen within a limited amount of time, trying to match three or more bubbles of the same color. The difference in this version is that bubbles cannot bounce on the walls; the player can only release them vertically. The game features characters from various Taito games, such as Bub and Bob from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bubble+Bobble\">Bubble Bobble</a> series, Tiki from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/new-zealand-story\">The New Zealand Story</a>, the dwarves from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/don-doko-don\">Doko Doko Don</a>, and others.",
