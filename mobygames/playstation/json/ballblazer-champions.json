  "description": "An updated version of the classic Ballblazer. The basic rules have stayed the same: two players in rotofoils compete to put the plasmorb into the enemy's goal. But the new version adds numerous power-ups including weapons into the game, so you can blast the enemy out of the way.<br><br>Choosing one of 8 different characters, each with a unique rotofoil, you compete in the Interstellar Ballblazer Championship to attain the title of Master Blazer. After a won game, you can upgrade your rotofoil with new equipment.<br><br>In addition to the tournament mode, there is also a practice option and a split-screen multiplayer mode.<br><br>",
