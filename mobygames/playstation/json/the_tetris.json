  "description": "<i>The Tetris</i> is an officially licensed <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> game that is part of the SuperLite 1500 budget series. This version consists of a single player mode and a multiplayer mode for two players. The singleplayer mode works like any other version of Tetris with the aim being to direct blocks down a well with the goal of creating and removing lines down the bottom of the well. The player then scores points and for every few lines removed the game's level increasing which leads to blocks falling at a higher pace. Before playing it's possible to choose a starting level. The multiplayer mode is for two human players only with no AI opponent being available. It works just like the singleplayer game but with one difference. When a player removes multiple lines at once, garbage blocks are sent over to the opponent whose stack then will rise. The player that survives the longest will win the match. ",
