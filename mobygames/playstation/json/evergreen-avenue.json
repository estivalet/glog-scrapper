  "description": "This is a world where spirits and magic exist, but have slowly been disappearing. Long ago, relations were cut between the living world and the spirit world, but recently the king of spirits has been considering restoring this connection. Moldelvia, a small town on the northern continent, has been chosen for an investigation into this possibility, and the king of spirits has sent seven spirits into the forest north of the town. They are to find a human guide for the king of spirits. They happen to come across two suitable candidates: a boy with the magic power to control puppets, and a girl who has overcome an impoverished upbringing with admirable spirit. These two must teach the spirits the ways of the human world, and ultimately invite the king of spirits back into their plane of existence.<br><br><i>Evergreen Avenue</i> is a simulation game. Choosing either a male (Catan) or female (Ira) character, you must help each of the seven spirits learn the ways of human life by scheduling sessions with them each week and playing mini-games to determine your effectiveness. Events will pop up from time to time, where you have personal conversations with the various spirits or with your rival. At the end of each month, you are graded in comparison with your rival, and you must sufficiently educate the spirits by the time six months have passed.",
