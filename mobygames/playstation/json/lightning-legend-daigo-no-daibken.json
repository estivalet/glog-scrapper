  "description": "The ancient country of Japon has existed for millennia, through times of peace and war. However, long ago, an evil creature called Dragules was sealed away in what is now the capital city, Azumakyo. Even today, the descendants of the heroes who sealed that monster away still live in Japon. One such person is a young boy named Daigo Raioh, who was rescued by a mysterious stranger when he was only eight years old. Now 14, Daigo has set out to find the one who inspired him to become a hero. At the same time, an ancient evil has begun to stir once again...<br><br><i>Lightning Legend</i> is a 3D 1-on-1 fighting game with a strong focus on story elements. The single-player story mode allows the player to choose from one of eight characters who are each traveling around Japon for their own personal reasons. Extended dialogue sequences before and after each battle drive the story. There is also a two-player versus mode.<br><br>The fighting system is comparable to other contemporary fighting games, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-street-fighter-ii\">Super Street Fighter II</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dead+or+Alive\">Dead or Alive</a>. Each character has their own set of standard and special moves, executed by various button commands. Each character also has unique special moves that can be used when their power meter is filled. It is also of course possible to jump, dash, block, and throw opponents.",
