  "description": "<i>Super Robot Wars F Final</i> (or &quot;Super Robot Taisen F Kanketsuhen&quot;) picks up where <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-robot-wars-f\"> Super Robot Wars F</a> left, starting at stage 35. F and F Final were originally thought as an unique game, but production delays made the producers decide to split the game in two parts.<br><br>This game features the first appearance of Mazinkaiser (created by contaminating the Mazinger Z with Getter rays).\nGameplay mechanics are the same of Super Robot Wars 4 (and Super Robot Wars F, of course). It's a turn strategy game, when attacked the player can decide to counter, to dodge (halves the % of being hit) and to defend (it halves the damage eventually received).\n",
