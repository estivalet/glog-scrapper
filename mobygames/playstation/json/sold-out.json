  "description": "<i>Sold Out</i> is a Japan-exclusive &quot;band simulation&quot; video game published by Shinko Music.<br><br>In <i>Sold Out</i> you are basically a band manager. At the very beginning you will have to choose a main vocalist for the future band. There are five available, all with their own styles. Then you will have to cruise the city and visit eight different locations in order to meet other musicians and composers that will sell their songs.<br><br>To successfully make a contract with a certain musician, you will have to answer few of their questions. If you don't choose the correct or appropriate option, you will not be able to make a contract and will have to wait until the musician appears again in the future. The band can be formed once a guitarist, bassist and drummer are hired. Then during the course of the gameplay, the band will have to make concerts in six different venues and release at least one CD under the three different recording companies. Promoting the gigs and CD releases are always essential to achieve success. During a concert, you can make few movements with the band members (except the drummer) and control the spotlights (and firework too but only in the last two venues).<br><br>There are 10 songs available, and to play each one at its &quot;fullest&quot;, you will need to gather the best lineup. If the band play a song with members that are not the most &quot;adequate&quot;, the sound will be different (worse) than when you use the best lineup. Therefore the attendance number and money gain will be obviously poor.<br><br>In the &quot;band meeting&quot;, there are options such as &quot;group talk&quot; and &quot;rehearsal&quot;. Choosing these two every single week will certainly influence the attendance of your upcoming gig and CD sales. Other options in band meeting include &quot;song list&quot; (where you can hear the songs you bought and read its lyrics), &quot;member change&quot;, &quot;band break up&quot;, &quot;gigs&quot; and &quot;CD release&quot;.<br><br>In the &quot;band chart&quot; you can check the gig attendances, CD sales, and listen to the song that your band played in a specific gig. Listening to them is important to spot which are the worst or best musicians for a certain song.<br><br>All the members are replaceable except the vocalist, however you can still hire other four vocalists in order to buy other songs, but having a song doesn't guarantee that you can play it because each vocalist can only perform about four or them. A song can be bought only when a certain vocalist is under contract.<br><br>The game will be over only when the money is all gone, that means if you choose &quot;band break up&quot;, the game will still continue as long as there's still money left, and you can start a new adventure with a new band. Meanwhile if a contracted musician is not used for a long period of time, he or she will eventually resign. Also, if the gameplay takes too long, the band will automatically disband by itself due to lack of motivation.<br><br>To finish the game, the band must release a cd under &quot;Bonny Record&quot;, and reach an attendance of at least 65000 people in the Tokyo City Dome. To access this final gig, you will have to play a song with the best lineup for it, otherwise you will not be allowed to access this last venue. Once you reach or surpass that number, the ending movie will start playing.",
