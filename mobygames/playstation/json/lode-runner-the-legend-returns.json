  "description": "A resurrection of the original classic platform game with a number of updates such as one and two player options, detailed graphics, character moves, a level editor, and music with sound effects. Besides running from some red-toga wearing &quot;Mad Monks&quot; that eat you (like in the &quot;Beast Master&quot; movie) if they catch you, you have a few things on hand to use: small bombs, big bombs (nothing will reappear when they destroy something), a drill (for stone floors), booby-traps, and a few other things up your sleeve.",
