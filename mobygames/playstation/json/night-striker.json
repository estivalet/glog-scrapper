  "description": "<i>Night Striker</i> is a third-person shooter reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-harrier\">Space Harrier</a>. Laser optics expert Dr. Lindvery Maska and his daughter have been kidnapped by a terrorist group, and Dick Dagras, head of the Special Service Agency, is mobilizing a group of elite soldiers experienced in the use of special armored flying cars, in order to rescue Dr. Maska and destroy this terrorist group.<br><br>The player flies through each stage, controlling their armored car and shooting down waves of enemies. A boss appears at the end of each stage, and after this the player must choose what path to take in the next stage, as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/darius-series\">Darius</a>. Instead of lives, the player has a shield that takes damage from each hit, but is recharged at the end of each stage.<br><br>The Sega CD version of the game features remixed CD-audio, and the Saturn version features a set of exclusive bonus levels.",
