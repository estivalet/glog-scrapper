  "description": "In <i>Mitsumete Knight</i>, you are a young man who is sent to the fictional medieval country of Dolphan, where you must train to become a Holy Knight and to defend the country from attacks by the neighboring state Valpha. But as you arrive at Dolphan, your interest is shifted towards the pretty local girls. Will you be valiant in your training, or will you spend your time trying to have a date?<br><br>This is essentially a &quot;dating-sim&quot; game with elements of RPG. You have a schedule and have to decide what to do in order to charm the girl of your dreams. Various activities increase your skills, and it's important to remember which girl will be impressed by a particular skill. In addition, you also have hit points and gain levels, just like in a traditional RPG. Sometimes you'll be attacked by the knights from Valpha or other enemies, which will result in battles. The outcome of such battles largely depends on your previous training. <br><br>",
