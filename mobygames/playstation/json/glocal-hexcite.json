  "description": "<i>Glocal Hexcite</i> is one of several conversions of the popular computer and board game. Players take turns placing shapes on a grid of triangles that make up seven hexagons. Any shapes placed on the board must touch the pieces already in play on at least one complete side; any outside hexagon completed will earn bonus points. If a player has any pieces left over at the end of the match that cannot be placed, they lose points for them. Matches are best two out of three.<br><br>The PlayStation version of <i>Glocal Hexcite</i> features a story mode with a cast of cute characters, as well as a two-player versus mode and an &quot;Official Game&quot; mode where the rules are slightly different from the normal game.",
