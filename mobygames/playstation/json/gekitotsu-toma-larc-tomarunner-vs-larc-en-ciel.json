  "description": "<i>Gekitotsu Toma L'Arc: Tomarunner vs L'Arc-en-Ciel</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Gekis%c5%8d+Tomarunner\">Gekis? Tomarunner</a>, but this time the focus is on the Japanese rock band L'Arc-en-Ciel. The game came to be for two main reasons; The lead singer of the band (Hyde) really loved the original game and the game served as good promotion for the band who were really popular at the time and had a new album in the works. The original game, as well as the band were both under Sony's roof at the time.<br><br>The gameplay is very similar to the game's predecessor, keeping the on-foot racing with heavy emphasis on using the terrain to gain the upper hand over the opponent. The characters all run at a set speed, but using the left and right arm as well as well timed jumps on poles, springboards and hurdles will give the player a speed boost. If enough momentum is gained, the character leans forward and starts dashing at a much faster speed. Some areas will even allow the player to be airborne for a certain amount of time if the right path is chosen and if enough speed is gained. Hitting obstacles, getting punched by opponents or having any of the &quot;weapon&quot; items used against the player will slow their speed down significantly, sometimes even resulting in the character falling over in a stunned state.<br><br>There are several modes in the game to choose from, including a single player tournament, two players versus each other and a series of tutorial levels where the player can practice the basics of the game (if a player fails enough times in any of the tournament levels, she/he is sent to the appropriate tutorial as a &quot;punishment&quot; as well).<br><br>The game is mostly cosmetically different from the original, and instead of the original characters the four band members have taken their place initially. Several of the original characters can be unlocked later through various means, such as beating them in races, completing certain objectives etc.",
