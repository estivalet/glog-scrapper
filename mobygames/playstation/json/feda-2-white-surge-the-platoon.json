  "description": "Taking place after the end of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/feda-the-emblem-of-justice\">the first game</a>, <i>FEDA 2</i> follows returning character Tom Woodland and new protagonist Harvey Winston. A civil war has broken out between the western and eastern regions, with players being thrust into the conflict. Although this game largely follows the tactical RPG mold of the previous one, the exploration portions have been removed with a greater focus on the tactical battles. The alignment system has also been removed, simplifying players' relationships with other characters.",
