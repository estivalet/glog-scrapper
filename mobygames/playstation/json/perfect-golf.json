  "description": "<i>The Perfect Golf</i> is a 3D polygon golf in which the word perfect refers to all the minutiae the game covers which is uncommon in golf games, sort of like a perfect guide. Besides the actual game mode, there are many extras included in the game, such as simulation mode which lets you enter your data and simulate the strategy of around 480 golf courses with detailed info on each of the course, its tracks, contact info and more. Advice mode contains live-action videos and comments by Hiroshi Tahara (?? ?), a professional golfer, as well as a detailed list of rules and manners with explanations and comic art representation.<br><br>The game mode covers around 200 actual golf courses in Japan, letting the player go through any of them in 1, 9, or 18 holes play. Several existing pre-defined characters modeled after professional golfers are available to play as, or you can generate your own golfer. The game uses behind camera but offers many options through the menu before each hit, some of which lets you move around the golf terrain like focus on the flag in the distance, or check your position by displaying the top-down representation of a hole you're at. Before hitting the ball you can select the club, where and how strong you wish to hit the ball, or change your stance. After all is set for a hit, the red circle on the ball will blip in a loop becoming smaller which requires timing to hit it perfectly, while the strength of the hit is set at ease before and doesn't require you to dictate it at the gauge bar as most other golf games do.",
