  "description": "<i>Mary-Kate and Ashley: Crush Course</i> is a game for one or two players.<br><br>The girls learn that their arch enemy, Courtney, has been seen near their lockers. On investigation they find pieces of a torn up note, an invitation to a beach party no less, but they have no idea who it's from. This sets the scene for a series of challenges, the rewards for which are further pieces of the note which eventually reveal which of the cute guys has a crush on them. The challenges are:<ul>\n<li>Freshman Year: <br>The Physics Class where a game of mini-golf is used to explore gravity, velocity and friction. <br>The Cheerleading Tryouts where the player(s) have to match the moves made by the gym teacher</li>\n<li>Sophomore Hall: <br>The Marine Biology Class which is a timed game where the object is to collect creatures and litter, one goes into the bin and the other is returned to the sea.<br>Journalism Class where the player(s) must explore the school and take photographs of the people on their assignment list.</li>\n<li>The Junior &amp; Senior Hall:<br>The Talent Show where the object is to follow the instructors moves and beat Courtney.<br>Journalism, again, but this time the player is taking pictures for the school year book.<br>Finally a series of seaside arcade games, Ball Toss, Treasure Hunt, and Hoops</li></ul>\nAll the mini games can be played as a series in game-mode or individually. In game-mode the games are graded, a B or higher is needed to win a piece of the message, and initially the player(s) will only have access to the games in the Freshman year. <br>They are all one or two player games and are keyboard controlled.<br><br>\n",
