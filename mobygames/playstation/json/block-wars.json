  "description": "One of the countless games based on the classic Breakout formula, <i>Block Wars</i> turns the game on its side -- literally. Two players play opposing games facing toward the center of the screen, attempting to clear their blocks and push the board towards their opponent's paddle. The winner is whoever clears all their blocks first or pushes the opponent's blocks all the way toward their paddle. There are three game modes, including 2-player Versus Mode. The game features character designs by famed illustrator Go Nagai.",
