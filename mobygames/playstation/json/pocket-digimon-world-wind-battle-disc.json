  "description": "A Museum was opened in the Digimon World. It preserved some ancient history and artifacts of the Digital World within. But one night, some evil Digimon decided to brake in and steal all the items, scattering them all around File Island.<br><br>Jijimon, the owner of the museum and eldest in the File City, decides to enlist some help from a Digimon Tamer (the player) to retrieve all the lost exhibits. These exhibits consist of art, music, information of Digimons, history of Digital World and video clips, which can be reviewed in the console game after collecting them. The actual main game primarily happens in a PlayStation accessory device known as PocketStation!<br><br>You can only get 3 different Digimons from the PS1 game to download to PocketStation. These are Patamon, Kunemon and Salamon. You can only use one at a time on the PocketStation game, though.<br><br>In the PocketStation, you can raise your Digimon and battle it either with in-game Digimon or a friend's PocketStation wirelessly over IR connection. You can also connect it to other Bandai Digimon games and products.",
