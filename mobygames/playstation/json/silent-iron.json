The game is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Ace+\">Jet Ace</a>.<br><br>The game offers thirteen missions in which you have to shoot down enemy aircrafts and mechs with either bullets or missiles while trying to avoid enemy fire. Both bullets and missiles will deplete as will your fuel. Fuel and ammunition can be replenished during missions by flying through a green ring saying fuel or bullets. You start the game with three lives and shooting down enemies earns you points for a high score, sometimes bonus points can be collected by flying through a green ring saying the number of points.",
