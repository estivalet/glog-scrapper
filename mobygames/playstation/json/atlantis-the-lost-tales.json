  "description": "The advanced city design of Atlantis shows that a fully-fledged society must've functioned there, and this adventure game brings it to life. Queen Rhea is the leader who is under threat, and young Seth is the character you control as he aims to save the day. How can he know who to trust, and who has their own agenda in this complex world?<br><br>The world of Atlantis is displayed in fully-rotational full-screen 3D comprising of millions of polygons and full lip-synching using a proprietary system. Listen out for sounds of danger - sometimes they are the first warning you get.<br><br>There are 5 different continents to explore, and each has its own cultures. In total there are 50 characters you will interact with, and puzzles using an inventory system. Save points are limited by the game.",
