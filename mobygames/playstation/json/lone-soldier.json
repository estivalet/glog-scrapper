  "description": "An alien force known as the Varinians have invaded Earth, and stolen an experimental &quot;super-missile&quot; in order to blackmail the world's governments into delivering further payloads of radioactive materials to them. Having further bolstered the defenses of their mothership by hiring on human mercenary forces and other ne'er-do-wells, there's only one man capable of wading through the enemy forces and defeating the alien menace: An ex-special ops unit by the name of Hank, who claims to &quot;pick his nose with a bayonet and wipes his arse with sandpaper.&quot;<br><br>Gameplay sees players taking direct control of Hank from a behind-the-back perspective, as you shoot your way through linear stages. Levels require you to kill a minimum percentage of enemies before proceeding to the next, lest you are made to repeat the same level again. Weapons include an Uzi submachine gun, bazookas, flamethrowers, and hand grenades.",
