  "description": "<i>Mass Destruction</i> puts players behind the controls of a one-man tank. The environments range from arctic to desert to urban. The player can blow up trees, buildings, walls - whatever you don't like the look. Enemies will come at you in tanks, planes, helicopters, and on foot. Each of the different weapons available to the player works best on a specific enemy. The player can use guided missiles for the helicopters and run over infantry men with the tank.",
