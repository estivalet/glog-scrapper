  "description": "<i>Choro Q Wonderful!</i> is the 4th game in the series and the last one to be released on PlayStation. Much like the previous games in the series, it involves racing and exploring in cute &quot;super-deformed&quot; cars, but it also adds some new things such as mini-games and an RPG element. The player also has to buy petrol and parts and this involves bartering with the sellers. The various cars have their own personalities, and there is a story involving them threaded through the game.",
