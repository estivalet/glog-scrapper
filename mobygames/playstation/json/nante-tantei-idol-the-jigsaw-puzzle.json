Tantei Idol: The Jigsaw Puzzle</i> is a jigsaw puzzle game featuring characters from the Manga written by Taku Kitazaki as well as images of Japanese swimsuit model Minato Yamabuki.<br><br>The game can be played in either an Endless Mode or a Time Attack mode. Regardless of which is chosen, the premise is that of assembling a picture which is first shown whole as a guide, then broken down to individual puzzle pieces. The player controls a cursor to pick up pieces and put them back into place. There are several different styles of pieces chosen at random before the start of the puzzle, such as square blocks, traditional puzzle pieces, zig-zag pieces and more.<br><br>There is also an image gallery for viewing all of the available images in the game.",
