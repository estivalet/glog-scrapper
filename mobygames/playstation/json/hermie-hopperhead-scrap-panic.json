  "description": "<i>Hermie Hopperhead: Scrap Panic</i> is a 2D platformer that takes inspiration from the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Sonic\"> Sonic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros\">Mario</a> games. Hermie Hopperhead is a young city kid with weird-looking red hair that sticks out in all directions. While waiting for his girlfriend, Trish, he happens to spot an egg with arms and legs come leaping out of a nearby garbage can. The bipedal egg coaxes him to come with it, and Hermie is lead into another world called Egg World. The world's resident villain, Mad Migo, is trying to take over this world of innocent egg people. What's worse, the evil Migo has taken Hermie's girlfriend, Trish, hostage. It is now up to Hermie to put a stop to Mad Migo's plans and rescue his girlfriend.<br><br> The gameplay is very similar to that of Mario games: enemies are usually defeated by jumping over them. A notable feature is the assistance of the inhabitants of the Egg world. Some of them follow the protagonist around and may turn into platforms and other things to help his progress.",
