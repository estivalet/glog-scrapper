  "description": "The ancient Maya civilization's artifacts sit buried somewhere deep in the jungle, their advanced astronomical secrets buried with them just waiting for adventurers to find them... One such adventurer is a teacher named Randy who, with several friends, flies to Guatemala in search for the legendary Jade Mask. This Japanese-style adventure game plays similarly to other games in the genre; gameplay is entirely menu-based, with players given a variety of exploration and dialogue options, while the graphics are presented with a cinematic art style and many detailed illustrations.",
