  "description": "Goofy stars in this 3D interactive adventure where he notices 5 photos in his home are missing three elements each. He must search his house and around his neighborhood for the missing items and place them back in the correct photos. Each fully restored photo will trigger a classic Goofy cartoon concerning the photo's topic such as &quot;Art of Skiing&quot; and &quot;The Blue Ribbon.&quot;  Finding a specific number of film canisters throughout the game will also trigger a sixth photo.  <br><br>There are 15 different environments such as the home's main floor, upstairs, basement, garage, attic, kitchen, Max's bedroom, recreation room, and back- and front yard. Objects that Goofy can interact with are highlighted, such as the furnace and refrigerator.  There are five additional sports-themed mini-games including golf, skiing, racing, and fishing that are triggered when certain items are found.  Also, there's a phone quiz in the foyer that gives players multiple choice trivia questions about Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto and others.",
