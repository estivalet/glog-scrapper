  "description": "<i>Genou no Altemis</i> is a detective adventure game that puts you in a role of Kyouichi Kusakabe, a 3rd-year college student who inherited a detective agency after the sudden death of his father. Being novice in the field won't stop him from trying to solve the mystery of what seems like an apparent suicide. The owner of a prestigious school for young actresses jumped of the roof. Could this really be a suicide or is there a culprit trying to mask it? After the prologue, you can branch the story based on your selection among five different heroines that will help you in your investigation, which take the story into entirely different directions and change other characters' dispositions toward you, even the culprit may end up to be a different person. Heroines that affect the story course are Makoto, Sarasa, Kozue, Moe, and Ryouko. The gameplay is a mix of visual novel dialogue interface and detective reasoning while questioning characters and looking for clues.",
