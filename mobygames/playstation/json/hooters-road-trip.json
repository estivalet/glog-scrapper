  "description": "In <i>Hooters Road Trip</i>, the player takes control of a muscle car, competing in races and different skill tests sponsored by Hooters Restaurants, a popular food and bar franchise in the U.S. that employs well-endowed women, in locations such as California and Florida.  The gameplay mostly consisted of racing against computer opponents while avoiding oncoming traffic, such as other cars and semi-trucks.  <br><br>The winner of these races will get to meet a real Hooters Girl (video wise of course), chosen for the game for each state they actually live (i.e., if they player wins a race in Florida, the player will get to see a Hooters Girl from a restaurant in Florida).  There are 12 different cars to choose from, some of which need to be unlocked by winning certain races.  Players can also race against each other in two-player action while the graphics are reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Destruction+Derby\">Destruction Derby</a>.",
