  "description": "<i>Super Robot Taisen ? Gaiden</i> is a side-story to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-robot-taisen-\">Super Robot Taisen ?</a> that takes place in the immediate aftermath of that game's climactic final encounter. It includes 45 new missions, features a simplified upgrade system compared to previous entries, and introduces the Support Ability system that allows adjacent units to attack or defend in unison.<br><br>The featured series roster is smaller than its predecessor, as it focuses more heavily on the series' own original characters, but several new series including <i>Combat Mecha Xabungle</i> and <i>Turn A Gundam</i> are represented.",
