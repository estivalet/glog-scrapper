  "description": "<i>WaiWai Tennis</i> is a tennis game using behind-the-player angled camera view. The game is authorized by JPTA (Japanese Tennis Association) and tried to be realistic even though characters may look less so. You can play as one of pre-selected male or female tennis players, or you can create your own character. Each character has his own ups and down, the game features dozens of moves and character skills which can become better through practice and playing matches and tournaments. Characters also have their preferred hand which will decide whether they'll hit a ball using a backend or forehand. The ball will not be automatically hit if you're in its vicinity, instead, you'll have to be well positioned to hit the ball and time your swing as well as the direction in which you wish to hit the tennis ball. Whether you catch and hit or miss the ball may also be affected by your skill level to perform a certain type of moves.",
