  "description": "You are standing behind the white house. There is something in the mailbox. A video message from a wizard informing you that you are the sweepstakes winner to the Valley of the Sparrows... right now, by magic flight. Upon arriving at this mysterious place however, not everything is as it should be. There's nobody to meet you and those who you do come across don't seem to have any knowledge about a sweepstakes. It looks like this is a private vacation and you'll need to find your own way through this land.<br><br><i>Return to Zork</i> is a first-person adventure game using live actors and video sequences. The game is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Myst\">Myst</a> in interface; the player is also able to rotate the viewpoint to discover new areas and uncover items that can be used or picked up. Various characters will be met along the way and spoken to via a system of dialog choices. The game allows the player to experiment with items in various ways, including discharging them; however, this often leads to &quot;dead ends&quot;, rendering it impossible to complete the game.",
