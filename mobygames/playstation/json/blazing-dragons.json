  "description": "<i>Blazing Dragons</i> is an adventure game based on the Nelvana cartoon of the same name. In this twist on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=King+Arthur\">King Arthur</a> legend, the player controls a young dragon named Flicker who lives in the kingdom of Camelhot. Flicker is an inventor who wants to become a knight and win a tournament. The prize is the hand in marriage of Princess Flame, Flicker's lifelong love interest. The player must solve puzzles to defeat the evil mechanical Black Dragon, the human race's entry into the tournament. The gameplay is mostly straight inventory-based point-and-click, but there are several arcade sequences that the player must successfully complete in order to progress.",
