  "description": "The famous psychiatrist Cyanos B. Cyan was preparing to go home from work when he was asked to counsel a girl called B.D., who has lost her vision and memory in an accident. When a gunshot is fired in his office, he realizes that he has no other choice but to help the poor girl. Through conversations with her over the phone, Cyan tries to shed light on the memories that haunt her...<br><br><i>Forget Me Not: Palette</i> is a remake of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Palette\">freeware adventure game</a> originally created in RPG Maker 95 featuring all new graphics, cutscenes with voice acting, music and a UI more suitable for the game. Players will need to have the psychiatrist call B.D. to gain control of her and go through nodes connecting different areas of her house, identifying various objects to help her find out what happened. Going through each node will have B.D. lose her energy and once she has no energy remaining, she will complain that her head hurts, hang up the phone and players will have to call her again to start over.<br><br>Collecting shreds of memories will allow B.D. to gain extra energy and players will need to find a place to &quot;put&quot; these shreds in order to unlock new nodes. There are some areas where B.D. can partly recover her energy and players will need to take note of those areas in order to progress through the game as they may not be able to acquire enough energy to progress otherwise. The story is told in scenes which players will encounter in a random order and requires a lot of backtracking as players unlock each node.",
