  "description": "<i>Carmageddon</i> for Sony PlayStation - is a unique version of the first game from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/carmageddon-series\">Carmageddon</a> series.<br><br>Due to the serious PlayStation's hardware limitations nearly everything was done from scratch for this release. That is why all the levels are completely different from what was created for the original game. Also, the zombies were made as 3D models instead of sprites (by the way, there is no possibility to turn on pedestrians as an alternative to zombies, but their blood is still red).<br><br>Core gameplay remains the same, but there are also mission levels with certain tasks to accomplish. All levels are divided into tiers and to progress further each level in a tier must be completed. There are some old cars and drivers as well as several new ones. It is impossible to steal opponents' cars as it was in the original title, instead of that nearly all of them can be bought for the credits in the shop.<br><br><i>Carmageddon</i> for Sony PlayStation was released only in Europe.",
