  "description": "The sequel to &quot;Spectral Force&quot; is set in a fantasy world called Neverland. The ruler of Demon Kingdom, Janes, was defeated by the hero Chiffon, leaving behind a son and a daughter, the children of his human wife. The two half-demons strive to regain the lost power. The sister Hiro re-builds the Demon Kingdom, while the brother Jadou finds a way to communicate with our world, and summons a Japanese schoolgirl who soon becomes a mighty warrior under his guidance. This sets the stage for further wars that once again begin to plague the Neverland...<br><br>This is a strategy war game in which you can play as one of the many kingdoms, including those that do not have a direct influence on the main story. You fortify your castles, hire generals, defend your country and invade others throughout several years. You can choose a combat strategy for your troops. Their strength depends on the special abilities and morale of the generals, as well as on weather and terrain. You can also cast magic spells in combat. ",
