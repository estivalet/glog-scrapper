  "description": "<i>Jigoku Yuuen Satsujin Jiken</i> (????????) is the second game from Kindaichi Case Files series for PlayStation console (overall third released game in the series), often referred to as <i>Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo 2</i>. The story protagonist is Hajime Kindaichi (????), a high school student, and more importantly a grandson of a renowned private detective after whom he inherited a knack for solving crimes by using deduction and reasoning similar in style to Shinichi Kudou in <i>Detective Conan</i> series.<br><br>Miyuki Nanase (????), Hajime's childhood friend got tickets for Shell Park, which is a resort with a sea theme split in four areas: Fantasy World, Aqua World, Adventure World, and Visitor World. After waking up Haime from his rather romantic dream, she storms out towards the park. During his pursuit of her and constant quarrel along the road, they spot a police car with detective Kenmochi heading somewhere. Not too far away, they come upon a crime scene where the victim was found hanging from a tree. It doesn't take but a few good looks for Kindaichi to point that this is not a suicide but a homicide. As they arrive at the Shell Park, after a little wondering they stumble upon a dead body near the jet coaster, and a small explosion takes out the &quot;S&quot; letter from the park's sign turning what's left of it to look like a Hell Park.<br><br>With so many people and staff around, the culprit could be anybody, but Kindaichi isn't going home until he roots out the evil and find the murderer. The game plays in two different ways. Adventure part is done through a typical visual novel conversation where all the characters feature voice acting and every scene is animated. Characters on the scene are animated while talking or just standing idly, while characters who are talking but not visible on the scene get animated in a small window in front of the displayed dialogue text. Exploration mode uses 1st-person perspective where you can move freely in 3D world of Shell Park. Dialogues also use the very same 3D scene as a background images, while cut-scenes use fully anime-like.<br><br>The game includes a couple of bonus materials enclosed within the manual, namely, a map of Shell Park which is double in width and height to a jewel case manual, and stickers featuring game title and main two characters (Hajime and Miyuki) which are designed to work as a PSX memory card stickers.",
