  "description": "The plot of <i>Castlevania Chronicles</i> is similar to that of the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=castlevania\">Castlevania</a>: in the end of the 17th century the dreadful vampire Dracula is resurrected after a century of slumber. The people in Transylvania flee in horror, but the brave Simon Belmont takes his Vampire Killer whip and ventures into the ominous castle to put an end to the Lord of Darkness.<br><br>The similarities to the first installment of the series are also evident in the game's overall structure and basic gameplay, as well as in level design and usable items. Most of the weapons and items from the first game return, with more rare and hidden items making an appearance. Familiar stages have been re-designed, and many new stages are introduced as well.<br><br>The PlayStation version includes a new rendered intro and ending, enhanced music and graphic effects, as well as an easier difficulty level (&quot;Arrange Mode&quot;). The original difficulty level from the Sharp X68000 release is present as well (&quot;Original Mode&quot;).",
