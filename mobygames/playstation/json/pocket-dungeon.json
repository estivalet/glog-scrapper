  "description": "Pocket Dungeon is a dungeon crawling role-playing game which is played entirely on PocketStation, Sony’s PDA crossed with a memory card. The PlayStation disc is used entirely for transferring data to the PocketStation, and the rest of the game takes place entirely on the tiny LCD of the PocketStation. The game has you exploring dungeons, levelling up, talking to NPCs and fighting monsters in classic RPG style. It also features a multiplayer mode, in which two players can battle using the monsters they've defeated in their dungeon adventures.",
