  "description": "It's the end of the Dominion Wars in the year 2377. Borg ships have been detected in the Titan system and are encroaching on Klingon space. Starfleet are mobilizing a squadron to repel the attack. One of the ensigns assigned to attack is Ryan Cooper, a rookie ensign just out of Starfleet Academy. But when a new force, the Kam'Jahtae, descendants of the Klingon enemy Hur'q, attack in hopes of reclaiming the space they once had, Ensign Cooper and his crew under Lt. Commander Worf inside the USS Typhon are in a race against time to save the galaxy from invasion!<br><br>In <i>Star Trek: Invasion</i>, you play as Red Squadron ensign Ryan Cooper, and fly the new Valkyrie fighter ship through thirty missions. Up to six versions of the craft are available in the game: three training versions that are only used in two-player modes, and three &quot;Marks&quot; versions that you fly during the game. (The higher the Mark, the more powerful it is.)<br><br>As you fight against the Borg, Romulans, Cardassians and a new enemy known as the Kam'Jahtae, you'll also chat with your fellow crew members, including Trek favorites Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard) and Michael Dorn (Lt. Commander Worf).",
