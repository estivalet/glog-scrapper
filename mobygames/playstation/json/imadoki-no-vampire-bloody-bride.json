  "description": "<i>Imadoki no Vampire: Bloody Bride</i> is a dating simulation game mixed with turn-based combat.<br><br>The game features a young vampire who reaches (vampire's) adulthood. But in order to become mature he must suck the blood of a girl with a &quot;Platinum Aura&quot;. However, this task is harder than it may look because the girl must willingly let him suck her blood.<br><br>The young vampire is sent to the human world in order to find a girl with that aura, having 3 years to complete that task. In order to get consent though, the vampire must work on his appearance, manners, strength and other skills and schedule dates with the girls where he must choose appropriate responses to improve his relationship with them. <br><br>As a vampire, the boy can wander at night in order to find common girls and suck their blood. Successfully sucking a victim's blood will have the vampire level up which will give him 10 points to assign to any skill which players wish to improve. The vampire will also encounter monsters with whom he'll fight in order to help him reach his adulthood, gain experience, souls which can be used to purchase items, weapons and accessories and berries which he can give to his female demon servants to improve their skills and have them successfully spy on the girls the player wants the vampire to go for.",
