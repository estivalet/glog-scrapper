  "description": "<i>Hugo: Frog Fighter</i> is a puzzle game starring Hugo the TV troll. The crocodiles of Don Croco are catching all the frogs. They plan to eat them at a big barbeque. Hugo is now off to save them from certain death.<br><br>The game is played from a birds eye perspective on a single screen per level. Hugo has to jump from floating tree trunks to gas bubbles and rocks to reach the end of the map. Usually, before the end of a map can be reached, a key has to be retrieved that opens a box. This holds another key that unlocks the end of the map. <br><br>Sometimes enemies like spiders and jumping fish have to be evaded. After completing a map a password is given that can be used to skip to this level when playing the game the next time.",
