  "description": "<i>Omega Assault</i> is a shooter where the player takes control of a large mech robot. The game is played from a first-person cockpit view. The player has not free movement and can only move to his left and right while freely moving the crosshair in any direction. The game has twelve missions which all involve shooting down other robots in futuristic city environments, while avoiding not to get shot down. The player's robot has three weapons that can be switched at any time (providing there's ammo left). They are the short range basic fire gun, the large range electromagnetic laser and the devastating bombs that do lot of damage but where the ammo is scarce. Enemies that are defeated sometimes leave different things behind them like points and power-ups that can be shot at to be collected. These include energy restoration and new lives. Enemy robots come in six different colors, and each of them has a different speed, weapon and amount of energy. ",
