  "description": "Once upon a time, there was a prince who wanted nothing else out of life but marry his sweetheart Fiana and live happily ever after. But his fate took an unexpected turn when his malicious brother Yurias killed their father, the king, and framed the prince for murder in order to get Fiana for himself. Possessed by despair, the prince's soul could not rest in peace. The prince made a pact with Satan himself, and was given the Castle of the Damned, where he would set traps to capture souls, grow stronger, and eventually get his revenge...<br><br><i>Deception</i> is a first-person perspective game that has elements of strategy and role-playing. The main activity in the game is setting traps for those who dare to venture into the castle, which requires magic points. Captured invaders can be dealt with in various ways. They can be released, killed, or have their soul devoured. The game registers the prince's deeds with a morality system: killing innocent people who just happen to be inside the castle would lower the morality level of the protagonist. Devouring the souls increases the hero's parameters, similarly to experience points in RPGs. Money can be obtained from corpses and spent on expanding the castle. Body parts can be used to create and summon monsters, who would help the owner to stop invaders. ",
