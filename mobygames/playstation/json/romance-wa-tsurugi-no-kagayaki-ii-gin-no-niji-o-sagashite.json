  "description": "The events of this game take place a few years after those described in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=romance+tsurugi+dos\"> first game</a>. The new hero is Keith, a young owner of a restaurant in the capital city of Barran. However, he also has a second profession: thief. He only steals from evil people, following the Robin Hood-like tradition of his father, who dedicated years of his life to uncover the secret of a mysterious dungeon known as the Tower of Daidalos. Keith wants to follow in his father's footsteps and to unravel the mystery of the tower. One day he accidentally meets a beautiful young girl who has lost a precious gem. The charmed hero swears he would find it and bring it back. But he doesn't know that the disappearance of the gem is closely connected to the mystery of the Tower of Daidalos...<br><br><i>Romance wa Tsurugi no Kagayaki II</i> shares many elements with its predecessor. While the exploration in the game is done in traditional Japanese RPG fashion, the battles resemble those of a turn-based strategy game, since the characters can move on the battle screen and can only attack when enemy is within the range of their weapons. There are no random battles in the game; all the enemies are visible on screen.<br><br>Like in the first game, the player is able to control the growth of characters, similarly to a Western RPG. Experience points can be accumulated, and leveling up is done manually by the player. Different character classes require different amount of XP to raise a corresponding attribute (for example, it costs less to raise a mage's magic power than stamina).<br><br>It is possible to imbue weapons with magical items to increase their powers and learn special weapon-related skills. There is also a dating system present in the game. The player can buy items for the female party members to increase their affection, and take them on specific sub-quests. This also influences the ending of the game.<br><br>Unlike the first game, <i>Romance wa Tsurugi no Kagayaki II</i> contains no nudity or sexual scenes, even though there is plenty of sexual innuendo in conversations and events.",
