BBros and SBB both involve your world being attacked by the Bubble King (the funny synopsis of BBros in the instructions notes &quot;One day for no particular reason the Bubble King began a siege on Earth's cities with multi-sized breakable bubbles&quot;- Idi Amin he ain't.), while BBuddies involves precious art being guarded by bubbles- in a rare turn of events, you play as the thief looking to steal the art!",
