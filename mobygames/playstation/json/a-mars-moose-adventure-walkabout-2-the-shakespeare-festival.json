  "description": "<i>A Mars Moose Adventure: WalkAbout 2 - The Shakespeare Festival</i> is among the more than 100 Lightspan Adventure educational games that were distributed to American elementary schools in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<br><br>Mars Moose and his friends are looking to perform a play at the local Shakespeare Festival, but don't have the $30 they need to rent the stage. They're given a chance to earn the money, however, by performing one of three tasks, each of which pays $10. In &quot;Backdrop,&quot; the player needs to sort props into the proper chests. In &quot;Orchestra Pit,&quot; the player needs to match sounds to the right musical instruments, and in &quot;Bookshelf,&quot; the player needs to organize Shakespearean scripts.<br><br>Part of Lightspan's reading and language arts curriculum, the game is geared toward children ages 5-7 and aims to teach musical instrument identification, how to sort and classify and information, and how to identify the beginning, middle, and end of a story.",
