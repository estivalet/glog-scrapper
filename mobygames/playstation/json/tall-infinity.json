  "description": "<i>Tall: Infinity</i> is an action puzzle game where the object is to build a tower by matching colored blocks. A block can be grabbed by standing on top of it and rolled in either direction. If the touching faces of two blocks share the same color when the block is released, they are matched and create more blocks for use in building the tower. There are also some blocks which have no color at all, and cannot be matched, as well as blocks with a rotating arrow on them, and can only be rolled in one direction. A block can be rolled up one level on top of another block, as long as there is open space next to it for the block to get to speed.<br><br>A time limit is imposed by the &quot;borderline&quot; which creeps up the tower. The borderline moves up one level every so often, and if it reaches the lowest incomplete level of the tower, the game is over. The borderline can be slowed by quickly matching blocks and maintaining a combo. Large combos also create additional new blocks when they are completed, making them essential on the more advanced levels.<br><br>There is also a puzzle mode where a preset assortment of blocks must have all of their faces cleared within a set number of steps. There are several BGM tracks and characters available.",
