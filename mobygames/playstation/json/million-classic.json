  "description": "<i>Million Classic</i> (?????????) is a simulation game which focuses on breeding and creating the ultimate racing horses. Player starts by creating your protagonist, the horse owner, which consists of entering the player's name and selecting the portrait for your character. Also, you get to select an outfit for your jockey (just the jacket) which can be customized in look, patter and color. The rest of the game focuses on you tending to your horse(s), making sure they are well taken care of in paddocks, and trained to become a good racing horses. You can also name your horses using similar interface to that for naming your character. You can buy and sell horses, breed them (selectively based on DNA strain), present them, and use them in races (the player does not control the race itself, you are more in a role of a manager or horse owner in this case).<br><br>The game comes with both jewel-case size manual book and technical book. Technical book gives more details on DNA and inbreeding, as well as courses, styles and other technical info. Additionally it includes four stickers with game artwork.",
