  "description": "<i>G·O·D Pure</i> is a remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=G%2eo%2ed\"> G.O.D: Mezameyo to Yobu Koe ga Kikoe</a>.<br><br>The story and the gameplay system remain the same; the changes in the remake mostly involve presentation. The game's graphical style remains rather faithful to the original in house interiors; however, cities and most dungeon-like areas have been re-designed as pre-rendered images. The perspective has become somewhat of a mix between the original top-down style and third-person perspective. Character graphics are very close to the original in style.<br><br>A few pre-rendered movie sequences were added during some of the key events of narrative. CD-quality music has been re-recorded for this release. ",
