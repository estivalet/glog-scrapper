  "description": "Aimed at children, <i>Herkules</i> is a minigame-focused release. The game features a 45-minute animated movie, which features voice acting and forms the basis for the art used in the minigames. There is a colouring book, where you can select from six illustrations and a smorgasbord of colour to bring the scene to life. Sliding tile puzzles have the player recreate a scrambled picture by moving the pieces around.<br><br>The PlayStation 2 version of the game was released as <i>legend of Herkules</i> and added two additional minigames not present in the original PlayStation game. Jigsaw puzzle is a self-explanatory event with three sizes of difficulty available. And of course, the card game memory match, which also has multiple levels of difficulty.",
