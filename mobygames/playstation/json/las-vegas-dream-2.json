  "description": "With $1000 in your pocket, you enter a futuristic casino with the hope of becoming a high roller. At the casino, you have the option of trying your hand at slots, blackjack, craps, roulette, poker, or keno. The game also contains a practice mode for the games. You have eight days in total to become a VIP and win the game. Each game takes off a bit of time for each playthrough, and there is also an eight-hour sleep option.<br><br>Despite only being released in Japan, the game contains English voice acting and FMVs. The FMVs set up encounters that can cause the player to either win or lose money by pawning off jewelry or asking for a favor. They can also simply drain the eight day clock via going shopping or viewing fireworks with the fellow casino goers.",
