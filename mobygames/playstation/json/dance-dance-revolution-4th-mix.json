  "description": "This music rhythm game challenges your eyes and your feet, with the appropriate dancepad controller.  Arrows appear on the screen and you must step in the right direction at the right time.  A wide range of difficulty makes it easy to learn for beginners while having extremely difficult songs for veterans.  The arcade version had about 140 songs, the Playstation version cuts it down to 48 tracks, but with the several new tracks and some oldies, make it an added value to the DDR fanatic.  All the features from the previous home versions are here: link mode, edit mode, diet mode, and plenty of other extras.",
