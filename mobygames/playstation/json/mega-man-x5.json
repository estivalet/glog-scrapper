  "description": "Years after the Reploid Wars, all seems peaceful in the world. But peace was not meant to last forever. When the &quot;Eurasia&quot; space colony is attacked by an unknown virus, the call goes out! X and Zero are called back into action to help destroy the colony, which is now on a collision course with Earth, and is expected to collide into the planet in only 16 hours! At the same time, Sigma, the archenemy of the Maverick Hunters, shows up again...<br><br><i>Mega Man X5</i> retains the gameplay style of the previous games, adding new features such as advanced Maverick AI, bigger and more challenging stages, and new gameplay elements: ducking and swinging on vines and ropes.",
