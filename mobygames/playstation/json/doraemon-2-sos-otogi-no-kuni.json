  "description": "Doraemon has brought a giant television from the future for Nobita and his friends to watch, but when they turn it on to watch some famous fairy tales, they find that all the heroes have been captured by an evil demon! Using another device, Doraemon transforms each of his friends into one of the famous heroes, and they enter the storybook world to rescue the captured heroes.<br><br><i>SOS! Otogi no Kuni</i> (&quot;SOS! Fairy Tale Kingdom&quot;) is a side-scrolling platform action game based on the popular children's cartoon <i>Doraemon</i>. Each stage is based on a famous fairy tale, with one of the children taking the role of the lead character to rescue the story's hero. For example, Nobita's stage casts him as Momotaro, while Shizuka's has her playing Little Red Riding Hood.<br><br>There are five stages, with each one featuring a different playable character, that can be played in any order. Each stage is broken into multiple sections, and includes at least one boss battle. Once all five stages are cleared, a sixth stage opens up.",
