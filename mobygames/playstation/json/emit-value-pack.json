  "description": "<i>Emit</i> is a visual novel divided into 3 parts which was made to help Japanese people study English. The game can be played both in English or Japanese with the ability to listen to the audio and/or read the transcript in both languages. There are 2 modes to play the game: Story mode and English Game mode. The story mode is the main game divided into chapters where players get to watch the story unfold and can do a number of exercises after each chapter. During the story mode, players can pause the game at any time in order to look up a term they didn't understand or to change the language.<br><br>The exercises are:<ul>\n<li>Listening comprehension activities where players pick the right options to check their understanding of the story.</li>\n<li>Guessing what's going to happen where players choose the question that's closest to their opinion and listen to the characters in the story commenting about the player's opinion.</li>\n<li>Conversation practice where students can listen to the characters speech and act out the dialogues.</li></ul>\nThe Value pack is a compilation of all 3 volumes of the game bundled together. This compilation marks the first time the game was released on the PlayStation.",
