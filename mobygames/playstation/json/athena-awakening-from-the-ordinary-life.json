  "description": "A spin-off of SNK's successful <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=King+of+Fighters\">King of Fighters</a> series, &quot;Awakening&quot; casts you as Athena Asamiya (of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/athena\">Athena</a> fame) as she discovers her latent psychic powers and uses them to aid her friends and unravel a conspiracy that threatens all of Japan, if not the world.<br><br>The game plays as a 3D adventure game with polygonal characters over pre-rendered backgrounds, and the main gameplay mechanics involve conversing with npcs and gaining clues as well as using your powers to solve several puzzles which involves following some audiovisual clues and repeating them. Do it right and you can use your power effectively, do it wrong and you'll give Athena a psychic backlash and drain her health. &quot;Action&quot; sequences play the same but involve tighter time limits and a turn-based system in which you must avoid enemy attacks in order to successfully use your powers.",
