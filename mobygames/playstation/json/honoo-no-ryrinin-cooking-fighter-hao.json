  "description": "The master chef Hao goes in a quest to hunt down and avenge his master by hitting every inn and restaurant he finds and picking a duel with the resident master chefs. Instead of hitting each other senseless however, the chefs engage in cooking fights, in which the character who prepares the best dishes wins.<br><br>The game is played in a top-down scrolling arena, in which you control your character and try to hunt down the animals that serve as the base of your recipes, once defeated you must perform special moves while cooking them, which decides the type of dish you get. Hitting each animal with the varied vegetables and seasonings found littered across the arena also expands the range of dishes you can create. At the same time the opposing player is actively trying to hunt down his own animals and can hit you to try to steal your dish (and vice-versa), the one that finishes first winning the match.<br><br>The game features colorful anime-styled cutscenes between fights, and includes a single-player story mode and a 2-player Vs mode, in which you can freely select from all the chefs in the game.",
