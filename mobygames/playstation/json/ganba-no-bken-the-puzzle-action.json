  "description": "<i>Ganba no B?ken: The Puzzle Action</i> is an arcade style action game similar to Capcom's classic coin-up game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Pirate+Ship+Higemaru\">Pirate Ship Higemaru</a>. The game is based on the 1975 anime TV series directed by Osamu Dezaki.<br><br>The player (or players if two people are playing) get to pick one of the mice from the Anime to control out of the seven available. The game itself is played from a top down perspective where the player tries to eliminate enemies by picking up items from the ground and using them as projectiles to dispose of foes. The items either break on impact or can be used an infinite amount of times. The player can rack up bonus points if they hit enemies and items in a row, causing a chain reaction of destruction. There are also hidden bonus items to be found under the weapon items. There are three ways that levels need to be beaten, and the player will be informed before the start which of the three applies to the upcoming stage. One is disposing a set number of enemies within the time limit. The second is to gather a set amount of hidden bonus items before the timer hits zero. The third is defeating a boss creature (on the last level of each section).<br><br>If the player were to lose a life, he/she gets to pick a new mouse from the roster of seven. The mouse which got defeated won't be available to the player until the next section of the game. Losing all the mice means the game is over.<br><br>Aside from the story the game also has a gallery, where the player can view unlocked artwork as they progress through the game.",
