  "description": "<i>Sentou Kokka: Air Land Battle</i> is the first in a series of <i>Sentou Kokka</i> (????) turn-based modern warfare strategy games. The game uses hexagonal maps and consists of all types of units, meaning player engages in fight on land, in the air, and on the water. Similar to other such games, each unit icon represents several units of the same type which are visible during combat animation. Units have movement radius, attack and defense stats, ability to auto-engage when enemy comes into firing range, experience, range of sight, etc. which gives them advantage over specific types of enemy units. Map terrains vary from forests and mountains to seas to deserts with cities and ports scattered around the maps which provide additional bonuses when conquered. The game supports up to 3 warring sides at once, each of which can be controlled by a player or two can be controlled by an AI.",
