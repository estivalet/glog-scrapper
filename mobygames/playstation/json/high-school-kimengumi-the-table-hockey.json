  "description": "<i>High School! Kimengumi: The Table Hockey</i> is a table hockey game based on the manga by Motoei Shinzawa with the same name.<br><br>The game can be played alone or up to four players. If played alone, the game is broken up into story sections for each of the characters between every opponent. And if played in versus mode, both players get to pick a character each (all with different special attacks), and go at each other.<br><br>The game is played from one end of the air hockey table and the player controls a paddle. The rules are; first to score 7 points wins the round. Best out of 3 rounds wins the game. While playing, bonus items will appear on the table and, if hit with the puck, they will give the character an advantageous item to use whenever needed. They may range from such things as earthquakes, invisible puck, force field blocking the goal and much more. Each character also has their own unique special attack which can be unleashed upon the opponent once a meter has filled up next to the player's portrait.<br><br>There is also a gallery, where pictures can be unlocked and viewed as the player progresses through the game.",
