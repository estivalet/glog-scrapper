  "description": "<i>Pachinko Paradise 2</i> is the second title in Irem's long-running pachinko simulation series. It features reproductions of four pachinko machines made by Sanyo Bussan: <i>CR Umi Monogatari 3R</i>, <i>CR Umi Monogatari 3</i>, <i>CR Umi Monogatari 6</i>, and <i>CR Umi Monogatari</i>. There are two modes available: Ts?j? (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sany-pachinko-paradise\">previous title</a>, there is no story mode.",
