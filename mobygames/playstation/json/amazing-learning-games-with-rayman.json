  "description": "Join Rayman in his quest to recover the Book of Knowledge which has been stolen by the evil Mr. Dark.  The gameplay of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Rayman\">Rayman</a> game is still present but kids from ages 6-10 must also read, count and spell as Rayman battles his way through the landscapes.  <br><br>As you guide Rayman around the platforms, you jump to different platform levels and can grab ledges or spin his ears to fly if you miss a landing.  He must throw his fists at enemies and grab rings for bonus.  The Magician will guide you as to what you must do in each level such as follow a path that has a correctly spelled word and go left or right depending if it's spelled right or wrong.  In other cases you may choose a word that rhymes, calculate a mathematical sum or step on a number.\n \nMath activities include counting, adding, subtracting, comparisons, and place values, while Reading Exercises cover spelling, phonics, word recognition, and word classification.  The three knowledge adventures consists of: 12 activities, 180 game levels in 6 worlds, with 50 different characters.  ",
