  "description": "<i>F?raiki</i> is a visual novel blending photographic backgrounds with anime-style character overlays. The player character is a travel blogger and photographer, who travels to Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido to document his journeys for his blog. On the boat to the island, he encounters a number of young girls also traveling there, whom you will have additional opportunities to meet during the main part of the game.<br><br>The main gameplay involves traveling around Hokkaido via motorbike and stopping at any location the player wishes, to take photographs or just enjoy the beautiful scenery of Japan's least densely populated and coldest region. While you will often encounter other people on your travels, be they local residents or the girls you met on the boat, doing so is not necessarily mandatory to enjoy the game as a whole. The game time is spread out over a month, and at the end of each game day, the player can set up a camping spot and write to their blog about a specific place visited, attaching pictures taken by the player where appropriate; the player will also see comments posted to each new blog post, or receive emails from the girls detailing where they will be so that the player can meet them if so desired. In scenes where the player does meet the girls, they will often accompany you through a specific location, and you will have the opportunity to take unique pictures of them against the scenery. All the backgrounds consist of actual photographs, with the characters often superimposed into the scenery where appropriate.<br><br>Originally released for the PS1, the subsequent PS2 re-release contains higher resolution graphics and full voice acting for all non-protagonist characters.",
