  "description": "In <i>Perfect Assassin</i>, you play an assassin who has lost his memory somehow and you have to make sure he gets it back.<br><br>The gameplay is from a third-person view, but the camera is always located at a set place on a map. You can walk anywhere on the map and the camera will follow your movement, but it will remain on the same spot, regardless of what you do.<br><br>The gameplay has some action in it, but mostly it is adventure-style solving of puzzles or talking to people.",
