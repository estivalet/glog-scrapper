  "shortName": "magical-drop-f",
  "description": "This is the first title in <i>Magical Drop</i> series developed exclusively for the home console. Basic gameplay is similar to other entries in the series: you need to clear the screen of falling drops of different color. This is done by grabbing a drop of any color and shooting it back on the board trying to connect 3 or more drops of the same color to make them disappear.  <br><br>Aside from Battle mode and Endless mode <i>Magical Drop F</i> features an RPG mode entirely new to the series: the player controls Justice, a girl who's on the mission to find 7 Magical Drops scattered across the land. Justice travels around a village talking to other characters, challenging them for battles and obtaining items and power-ups. In battle mode the player can use rechargable special attacks which usually have some benefits for the player or make mischief for the opponent.",
