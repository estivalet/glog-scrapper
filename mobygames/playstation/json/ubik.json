  "description": "The game is based on the novel <i>UBIK</i> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,20836/\"> Philip K. Dick</a>. The player controls the main character from the book, called Joe Chip. He is working for a company called Runciter Associates in Los Angeles (in the year 2019), and his job is to protect companies against industrial spying from other companies. With genetic engineering and the development of replicants both sides have PSI-powers at hand to reach their targets.<br><br>In the game you lead, train and equip a squad of selected individuals (with various abilities, be it several kinds of weapon skills or PSI) through 3D-realtime rendered maps, where you sometimes can interact with your environment or even talk to some individuals.
