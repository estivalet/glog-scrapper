  "description": "A compilation package featuring the classic arcade puzzle games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/puyo-puyo-2\">Puyo Puyo 2</a> for the Playstation.<br><br>Gameplay involves stacking and ordering color-coded blobs or &quot;puyos&quot; as they fall into your play area and arranging them in groups of the same color to clear them off the screen before you get flooded with falling pieces a la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a>. The twist in Puyo Puyo is that you must also select a character and then face-off against a series of opponents in vs matches in which every time you clear groups of puyos you send &quot;garbage&quot; puyos to your opponent (and vice versa) in hopes of stopping his advance and outlasting your opponent.<br><br>The compilation comes with both full games and several choices of gameplay modes, as well as also including a completely independent &quot;quest&quot; mode in which you play an rpg as series heroine Arle as she explores the world in search for 6 magical seals. You can equip items that enhance your stats and roam the game world in a top-down world map view, interacting with npcs and exploring dungeons, with all fights taking the form of Puyo Puyo duels.",
