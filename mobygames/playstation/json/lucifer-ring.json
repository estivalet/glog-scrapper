  "description": "In true fairy tale style, evil is about to lay its dark shadow over the world. The only way to stop this from happening is to collect 4 magic rings. Cue Nash, generic hero. Equipped with a sword and a limited amount of magic he sets out to slash, hack and slice his way to the 4 rings and in the end, a much nicer world to live in.<br><br>The game plays much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Golden+Axe\">Golden Axe</a> but in full 3D, where Nash walks along a linear path and is constantly confronted by monsters who want nothing more than to end his life. Every now and then the player is given an opportunity to choose paths to get from point A to point B in several ways. At the end of every stage there is a boss waiting for Nash to make his day just a little less sunny and cheerful. In other words, they are usually evil and need plenty of killing.<br><br>Nash has two standard attacks, one harder (but slower) and one weaker (but faster). Nash also has the ability to jump to cross broken bridges, cliffs and other natural hazards. A meter at the top of the screen fills up as Nash kills enemies and when it is full the player will be able to unleash a very powerful attack, which usually kills all the enemies on the screen.",
