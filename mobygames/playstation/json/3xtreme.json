  "description": "This extreme racing game comes with four different game modes. The modes are Season, Exhibition, Time Trial, and Freestyle. The main mode is the Season mode, which lets the player race through three circuits of a number of races each. The first circuit has six races, the second eight races, and the third has ten races. In these races the player is competing against five other racers in order to get in the top three positions for season standing points. The higher the position in the race, the more points the player will have to spend on better equipment.
