  "description": "One of the many releases in Konami's long-running rhythm game series, <i>beatmania featuring Dreams Come True</i> includes 13 songs and remixes by the popular J-Pop band <i>Dreams Come True</i>. It is a port of the earlier arcade version who has 18 songs, where two remixes and three songs by Konami's own artists have been removed from the home release due to copyright license. Additionally, this release can also be used to play the numerous <i>beatmania</i> &quot;append discs&quot; that Konami released. Despite being the second game of featuring the J-Pop duo after <i>Dancing Stage featuring DREAMS COME TRUE</i>, there were not more games imitating this strategy brand.",
