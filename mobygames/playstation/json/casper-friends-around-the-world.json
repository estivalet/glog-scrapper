  "description": "Players join Casper in his quest to rescue his lost friends and help them return home after being scattered all over the world by the evil ghost Kibosh. Players will have to guide Casper through over 10 levels, each filled with classic platform game action and adventure. With Casper, players can explore each level to find the missing map page, and to collect all of the scattered friendship crystals. As players explore each level, they can further enhance Casper's moves by finding three special power-ups that will give Casper the edge over the evil Kibosh. Casper must find all of his missing friends and help them return home before it's too late.",
