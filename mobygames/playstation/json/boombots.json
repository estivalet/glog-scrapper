  "description": "Some time ago - it could have been 1983 or 15 billion years -  alien cats invaded Earth, nabbed all of its house cats, and took off.  Dr. Pick created fifteen BoomBots, each with distinctive abilities and personalities, and sent them to destroy Mandu, the space alien cat king, and rescue Earth's house cats. <br><br><i>BoomBots</i> is a 3D one-on-one fighter that relies on distance fighting (gunshots and the like) and use of the 3D interactive environment for strategic purposes. The game has a cartoony style and humorous overtones. The FMV intros are done with clay animation.",
