  "description": "For decades, the clans of Bloodland were locked in a never-ending war; then the Wanderer arrived with the Book of Knowledge. He divided the book and gave each clan a piece, hoping the clans would come to rely on each other's newly acquired knowledge. The Wanderer left and the clans, hoping to reassemble the book, returned to their old ways. <br><br>That is when Syn appeared. She turned the pieces of the book into weapons and organized a tournament of the clans' warriors. Whoever wins the tournament will control the Book of Knowledge and become the ruler of Bloodland.<br><br><i>Cardinal Syn</i> is a gory versus fighting game, set within a series of character-specific arenas that may include traps such as poisonous puddles or lava. Players can choose between 20 characters, each with unique combos and weapons (including ranged and magic attacks) and battle their way through the tournament. Additional modes include Practice, Survival, and Team Battle.",
