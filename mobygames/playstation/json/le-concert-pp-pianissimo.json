  "description": "<i>Le Concert pp</i> (pianissimo) is a rhythm game in which the player takes the role of a young female classic orchestra conductor. &quot;Pianissimo&quot; refers to the volume of a soft sound or soft note. It was released alongside <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/le-concert-ff\">Le Concert ff</a>.<br><br>There are five open stages, plus a secret one which will appear only if good results were achieved. After beating the stage five, a very short ending will play. To see the &quot;real&quot; ending (plus credits), the stage six must be finished. Before and after each stage there will be dialogues between the protagonist and other characters.<br><br>Every level consists basically on directing the orchestra by making the right movements and hitting the buttons in proper time. &quot;Pieces&quot; of the music appear from the right of the screen, the better you get the higher your ranking will be.<br><br>There are two different game styles: gamers mode and musicians mode. In the latter one, &quot;musical dynamics&quot; will be displayed instead of regular buttons (those from the PlayStation controller).<br><br>Once a stage is finished, the music will be unlocked and can be listened in the &quot;listening room&quot;. One of the music included in Pianissimo is &quot;Radetzky March&quot; (composed by Johann Strauss Sr.).",
