  "description": "<i>Rescue Shot</i> is a shooter developed and published by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Namco\">Namco</a>. On one side, it differences from the famous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Point+Blank\">Point Blank</a> series. The game, in fact, looks more like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/time-crisis\">Time Crisis</a>, which doesn't rely on accuracy less very much, thus letting you enjoying the fast-pace of the game dynamic. On the other side, the variety in <i>Rescue Shot</i> is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Point+Blank\">Point Blank</a> series.<br><br>The game takes place on a lot of different scenarios, full of traps to avoid and dangers to overcome: from a manufacturing industry to a tube, from a Japanese market district to a country village.\nThe main character in the game is Bow, a dog who wanders through a fairytale-esque land where all sorts of minions try to hamper his progress. The aim of the adventure is to help Bow regain his memory after he fell off a cliff. He needs to collect all 5 dream fragments to be able to make a wish, so he can remember where he came from.<br><br>Each of the 10 scenarios (grouped in 4 stages) has got its unique inhabitants (robots, birds, porcupines, bats, ...) and boss (a tiger, a wolf, a machine...). Tons of items in the background, from mushrooms to spiders and flowers (and even windows), can be shot to reveal power-ups of all sorts. Occasionally you have to shoot Bow in the derriere to get him to jump over obstacles, or a timely shot to the head will cause him to duck flying objects.",
