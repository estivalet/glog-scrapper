From many of these links emerged the hives. <br><br>The usual mission objectives in the game are to destroy the mutated creatures and the hives, rescue local inhabitants, while &quot;beaming up&quot; weapon upgrades along the way. Players are then awarded &quot;trophies&quot; for each world saved or if it is saved quickly. These trophies allow the player to receive new ships.   ",
