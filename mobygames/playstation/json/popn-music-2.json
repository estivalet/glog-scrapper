  "description": "<i>pop'n music 2</i> is one of the many titles in Konami's long-running rhythm game franchise. Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen along nine tracks, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the &quot;groove meter&quot; increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.<br><br>This release includes all of the tracks from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=pop%27n+music\">first game</a>, along with the new tracks from the arcade release for a total of over 40 songs to play. Several new high-difficulty modes for advanced players have been added, and there is also support for a miniaturized 5-button version of the game called <i>Dokodemo pop'n music</i> that can be played on the PocketStation or Dreamcast VMU. It also functions as a Key Disc for latter Append Disc releases in the series, much like Konami's other Bemani franchises.",
