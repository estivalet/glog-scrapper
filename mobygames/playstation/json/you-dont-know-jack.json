  "description": "<i>You Don't Know Jack</i> is a humorous trivia game for up to three players. The players take part in a quiz game, which partly parodies television shows such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Jeopardy\">Jeopardy</a>. The players do need to answer serious questions, and knowledge of various topics (ranging from classical literature to modern pop culture) is required; however, the show's host is distinguished by his sense of sarcasm, sometimes offering humorous wordings for questions, and sardonically addressing the participants.",
