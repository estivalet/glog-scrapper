  "description": "The FIFA series returns for another season to the original PlayStation with <i>FIFA Soccer 2004</i>. Changes compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/fifa-soccer-2003__\">the predecessor</a> are minimal, with updated stats and rosters, new music tracks, redesigned menus and even some gameplay modes and teams removed. None of the new gameplay features of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/fifa-soccer-2004\">next-generation version</a> like Off-the-Ball control, second-tier leagues or career mode have made it to this version.<br><br>The game includes teams from 12 different national leagues, plus 19 teams from the rest of the world, as well as 36 international teams. Game modes include friendly matches, season play for all 12 leagues and several tournaments: EFA Trophy (i.e. UEFA Cup), European Champion's Cup (i.e. UEFA Champions League), International Cup (i.e. World Cup) and European Challenge (i.e. European Championship). Custom cups are also available.<br><br>Controls as well as camera and gameplay options are unchanged compared to the previous year. Advanced passing and shooting with power bars can be toggled on and off.",
