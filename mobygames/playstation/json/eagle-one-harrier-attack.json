  "description": "Eagle One: Harrier Attack is an action game that casts the player as a United States Marines pilot who flies a variety of missions against a terrorist group that has taken over the Hawaiian islands. An underground terrorist group has detonated an electromagnetic pulse device in the air over Hawaii, which has destroyed all lines of communication, rendering U. S. military forces based there useless. The U. S. president responds by deploying a Marine Corps task force led by Eagle One. Using a multipurpose attack plane, the Harrier Jumpjet, the player must regain control of the Hawaiian Islands. ",
