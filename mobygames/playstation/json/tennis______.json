In Tournament Mode, you face off in either singles or doubles, which get harder as you progress. You must get into the Top Seed in order to get into the Championships and win. In Free Mode, you can choose the settings, court, and either singles or doubles. There are 16 different characters, each with their own signature moves and skills. You can change the difficulty of the CPUs in both Tournament Mode and Free Mode.",
