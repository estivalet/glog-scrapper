In the single player mode, you will have to choose between the three classic sub-modes : tournament, time attack and single race. New with this release are the two 2-players modes : Duel and Driver Vs Police. In the Duel mode, race head to head against a friend. In the Driver Vs Police mode, one choose to play a police man, the other must try to drive as fast as possible to escape.<br><br>The game also features three skill levels, repairing and fine-tuning options in the tournament mode, and of course new and enhanced graphics to race through France and its famous cities such as Marseilles, Paris or Lyon. Three bonus races can also be played in London, Edinburgh or Las Vegas!",
