It features reproductions of three pachinko machines made by Sanyo Bussan: <i>CR Sushiya no Taish? P7</i>, <i>CR Sushiya no Taish? M3</i>, and <i>CR Sushiya no Taish? L8</i>. There are two standard modes available: Ts?j? (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed.<br><br>The game includes a simple story mode where the player takes the role of Gen-san (better known as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Hammerin%27+Harry+legacy\">Hammerin' Harry</a>) who travels around his two with two friends, solving problems by playing pachinko.
