  "description": "<i>Engacho</i> is based on a popular Japanese children game. You play a little boy named Sunzuki, who wants to prove to his angry father that he is not a coward and can stand up against the terrible monsters of the Oops Five group.<br><br>The gameplay is turn-based, and your goal is to outsmart the monsters and get to the exit of the stage without colliding with them, and make it there within the set limit of steps. Each monster has his own movement style, so you have to learn how they all move to stand a chance. One will move opposite of your movements, one will imitate you exactly etc.<br><br>There are different modes in the game, such as training, in which you face just one monster of your choice and get used to his patterns; puzzle mode, which takes you through a series of rooms with different shapes and monsters; and battle mode, in which you are thrown into large rooms where all Oops Five members roam freely.<br><br>Unlike its little brother <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Engacho%21\">Engacho!</a> on the Wonderswan, this game is viewed from an isometric perspective while the other version is top-down.",
