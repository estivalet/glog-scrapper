  "description": "As the name states, <i>Victory Zone</i> is a Pachinko simulator. Pachinko is a gambling device resembling a pinball machine without flippers. Balls are launched into the play field, to hopefully land in an area that gives bonus balls. The player can control the launch speed of the ball, but nothing else. The tables feature a slot machine mechanism in the center, that if landed on, will spin, with the largest payouts coming from here.<br><br><i>Victory Zone</i> includes 10 modern electronic tables, and 10 mechanical tables from Sankyo. Tables can be customized in various ways, including changing the background graphics and music, as well as gameplay changes. In addition, a two-player mode (called Attack Mode) is included, where one player has a certain amount of time on a table, then player 2 has to beat their score.<br><br>In-game, the table can be panned, zoomed, and rotated to examine it more closely. The player's wins and losses over time are recorded and can be viewed as a graph.",
