  "description": "<i>Ikky?-san: The Quiz</i> is a quiz game based on the anime with the same name revolving around the historical Zen Buddhist monk Ikky? and his adventures as a child.<br><br>There are several game types to choose from, such as Story mode and a  Versus Mode (either player vs. player or player vs. computer). The gameplay is simple. Questions are written at the top of the screen and the player gets four alternatives which all correspond to the four buttons on the controller. To progress, a certain number of questions have to be answered correctly. If a question is given a wrong answer, Ikky? loses a chance. If all the chances are gone, the round is lost and the player has to try again.<br><br>There is also a gallery where images can be viewed. These are unlocked as the player progresses through the game.",
