  "description": "<i>Spawn: The Eternal</i> is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,94289/\">Todd McFarlane's</a> Spawn comics.  The game switches back and forth between two styles of play.  There's an exploration mode, which is along the lines of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tomb+Raider\">Tomb Raider</a>.  Spawn must climb and jump his way through a variety of environmental obstacles while smashing crates and furniture to find power-ups.<br><br>When you approach an enemy, however, the engine switches into something between a 3D fighting game and an old-fashioned side-scrolling beat-em-up.  Spawn must defeat one or more enemies, who may be surrounding him before he can continue.",
