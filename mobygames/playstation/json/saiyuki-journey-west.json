  "description": "<i>Saiyuki: Journey West</i> is loosely based on one of the four classical novels of Chinese literature, <i>Journey to the West</i> (Chinese: <i>Xi You Ji</i>) by the 16th century writer Wu Cheng'en. This tactical RPG lets the players take the role of the novel's hero who is also a historical character, the 7th century scholar and Buddhist monk Xuanzang (Japanese pronunciation: <i>Sanzo</i>) and his monster companions, including the famous monkey Sun Wukong (Japanese pronunciation: <i>Son Goku</i>), as they travel to India. The game takes quite a few liberties with the original tale, including allowing the player to change Xuanzang's gender, giving each monster a more powerful &quot;were-&quot; form, and tying each character, save Xuanzang's, to an elemental affinity.<br><br>The real meat of the game is the tactical battles, where careful unit placement and use of each monster's unique special abilities determine the outcome of the battle.",
