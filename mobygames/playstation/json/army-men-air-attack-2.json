The player controls a green toy helicopter through a suburban setting. The aircraft is equipped with weapons and a winch. At the start of each mission, the player can choose the helicopter model and its co-pilot (whose characteristics modifies the behavior of the airship. For example, a specialist in guns increase the accuracy of shots). The mission objectives vary: there are rescue missions, where the winch is used to collect a character or object, demolition missions, where something has to be destroyed, and escort missions, where something must be protected from enemy attacks.<br><br>The PlayStation version contains two additional missions.<br><br>",
