  "description": "The year is 2067. Prosperity has spread throughout the world. However, decadence has started society's decay. Similar to the decline of the ancient Romans, the only spectator sports left are blood sports. Duels between huge tanks, known as cyber sleds, are the most popular.<br><br>The user plays as one of these future gladiators. Jump into one of 6 tanks, each varying in speed, shield strength, weapon power, and maneuverability, and enter an arena.<br><br>As an added bonus, choose between the original arcade arenas or exclusive PlayStation arenas. Avoid obstacles and try to blast your opponent into small unrecognizable pieces with machine guns, heat seeking missiles and other weapons. The game also supports 2 player modes, via a split-screen option.",
