  "description": "<i>Ky?mei-hen</i> is a direct sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/twilight-syndrome-tansaku-hen\"> first</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Twilight+Syndrome\"> Twilight Syndrome</a> game, continuing the spooky adventures of the three brave and reckless high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. The first mystery involves a girl named Sakura Himegami, who was killed in an accident many years ago; apparently, her ghost is still around somewhere. The trail leads to an abandoned path in the mountains; Mika decides to venture there, while the other two are going back to school at night, hoping to find more clues.<br><br>The gameplay is identical to that of the previous entry: the player navigates the digitized images of the girls over 2D backgrounds in a side-scrolling/third-person perspective manner, searching for clues, triggering scenes, and choosing responses and/or actions when prompted by the narrative. As in the first game, these choices may influence the course of the story, and lead to various endings of the chapters; reaching a &quot;bad&quot; ending prevents the player from continuing to the next chapter.<br><br>",
