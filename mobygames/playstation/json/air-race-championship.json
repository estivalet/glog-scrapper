  "description": "<i>Air Race Championship</i> is an arcade style racing game where you fly planes through imaginative tracks. The tracks lead you through cities, caves, rivers and even some underwater tunnels. You start with a choice of four tracks and three planes. There are more tracks and planes but you have to unlock them. You can play solo in grand prix mode or time attack, or race against a friend in split screen mode. It is a spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bravo-air-race\">Bravo Air Race</a>.\n",
