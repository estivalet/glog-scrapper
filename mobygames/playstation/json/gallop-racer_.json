  "description": "<i>Gallop Racer</i> is a horse racing simulation. It has both a season and preseason mode. The game lets the player customize the color of their jockey's stripes. Players can spend their starting money to purchase horses (each with their own unique attributes) at the Horse Shop and can earn more money by doing well on the track. On the other hand, players can lose money by not placing in a high enough position during a race as entering races costs money.<br><br>While on the horse track running their horse, players can apply the whip to the horse and can also rotate the view of the race. The game tracks the players performance throughout their racing season.",
