  "description": "Premier League Stars is football game from EA released just a few months before FIFA 2000. The two games are quite similar but Stars is a bit more pacey and more action than the more realistic FIFA. Whereas FIFA has several leagues the Stars game has focused on the English Premier League and it is full licensed with all the real clubs, kits, stadiums and players. The most unique feature in Stars is that it is using the Stars concept which means that you collect stars when winning matches, scoring goals and similar. The stars could be used to improve the players in different skills such as passing, shooting and tackling. ",
