  "description": "<i>Tall: Twins Tower</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tall-infinity\">Tall: Infinity</a>, and builds directly on the ideas it. The gameplay is largely the same, but new in this version is the choice between two different characters, each with different special abilities. One has the ability to pick up a block that's between two other blocks, and would otherwise be immovable. The other has the ability to shift a layer of blocks horizontally.<br><br>Also new is a two-player versus mode, which was noticeably missing from the original game.",
