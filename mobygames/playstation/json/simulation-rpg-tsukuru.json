  "description": "<i>Simulation RPG Tsukuru</i> is, much akin to its brethren in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=RPG+Maker\">RPG Maker</a> line of games, a construction kit and editor to make RPGs. In this case, it's &quot;simulation&quot; RPGs or, as they're more commonly known, tactical/strategy RPGs in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Fire+Emblem\">Fire Emblem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Shining+Force\">Shining Force</a>.<br><br>The construction kit gives the player a menu based interface where it's possible to change almost every detail of the game being made, down to the character sprites, background music and individual statistics for each character.",
