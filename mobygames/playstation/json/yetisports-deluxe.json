  "description": "<i>Yetisports Deluxe</i> is collection of two mini games based on the Yetisports browser games:<ul><li>Super Pingo Throw: Based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Yetisports+Part+1%3a+Pingu+Throw\">Yetisports Part 1: Pingu Throw</a>. The player takes the part of a polar bear with a baseball bat. A penguin falls from a mountain and the player has to hit him with a timed mouse click. The goal is to time this perfectly so the penguin flies a long range. In comparison to the browser game this version adds additional obstacles which stop the penguin, wales which give a speed boost when the penguin lands on it and wind. There is also an additional playing mode where the player has to strike other ice bears which are standing on the runway.</li><br>\n<li>Orca Slap: Based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Yetisports+Part+2%3a+Orca+Slap\">Yetisports Part 2: Orca Slap</a>. Here the player stands in front of a big dart board. Then penguins fly into the screen (on at a time) and the player has to throw a snowball at them. Then the penguin gets deflected and flies to the dart board and the player scores. The goal is to get a high score. In comparison to the browser game this version adds a slot machine between rounds where the player can get additional penguins or snowballs. There is also an additional playing mode where the player has to hit specific fields on the dart board.</li></ul>Both games feature improved graphics and a multiplayer mode.",
