  "description": "<i>A.IV. Evolution</i> is an updated console-only port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/take-the-a-train-iv\">Take the A-Train IV</a>, the fourth main entry in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Artdink\">Artdink</a>'s long-running railroad management simulation series. It is largely a straight port of the original PC title, but the interface and graphics have been redesigned for the console format.<br><br>The most significant new feature of this version is the ability to ride the trains and view the player's city in a full 3D polygon view, which would become a staple of later entries. The game was later released internationally with a number of additions as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/a-train_\">A.IV Evolution Global</a>.",
