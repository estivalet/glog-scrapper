  "description": "In this game you are Duncan - a man, who must save the worlds of Dream and Reality from dark force.<br><br>While in the PC version called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreams-to-reality\">Dreams to Reality</a> you have a whole dream world to explore, progressing in a storyline, solving puzzles and having conversations with NPCs, the Playstation version is a simple arcade-style game: you're placed in a small area of floating isles where you must defeat all the monsters and collect all the objects in order for an exit to pop up. This exit will then lead to a new small area of floating isles. In this game you can choose between a variety of playable characters, all of which have a different skill and style of movement. Also, the intro video is completely different to that of the PC version.",
