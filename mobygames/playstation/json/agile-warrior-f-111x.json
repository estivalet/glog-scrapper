  "description": "Because of international conflicts and new dangers due to terrorist attacks the Air Force needed to construct a new warplane which can be uses for multiple roles like frontal attacks or stealth operations. The result: a mixture between the YF-23's (high performance airframe), the X- 31's (thrust-vectoring maneuverability), and the F-111's (superior terrain and weapon-guidance systems).<br><br>In <i>Agile Warrior: F-111X</i> the player pilots one of these aircraft to solve the mentioned issues in about six missions. To be successful he needs to utilize all of the aircraft's features, e.g. rockets, a radar which uncovers nearby enemies or the ability to cloak. The latter is important during the stealth missions in which the player needs to avoid hostile radars.",
