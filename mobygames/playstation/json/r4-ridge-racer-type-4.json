  "shortName": "r4-ridge-racer-type-4",
  "description": "Developed exclusively for the Sony Playstation, this fourth title in the <i>Ridge Racer</i> series features new visuals, powered by goraud-shaded polygons, giving each car and track a more refined appearance, while keeping the same arcade gameplay popularized by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=711719243724\">the first game</a> of the series.<br><br>While it includes the usual time attack and a new split-screen versus mode, the focus of the game is the <i>Real Racing Roots '99</i>, Ridge City's three heat, seven race championship, with the grand finale in a speedway during New Year's Eve.<br><br>The player starts by choosing one of the four teams available (from easiest to harder): <i>Micro Mouse Mappy</i>, directed by the lovely Sophie Chevalier who hopes to win the first title in many years for the French team to honour her ill grandfather, <i>Pac Racing Team</i>, a recently created Japanese team directed by Shinji Yazaki who expects to create an immediate splash in the Ridge City racing scene, from Italy the RRR champions <i>Racing Team Solvalou</i>, with the demanding Enki Gilbert at the helm, and the American team <i>Dig Racing Team</i>, who has fallen into financial difficulties, with team director Robert Chrisman struggling to provide the driver with a car capable of out-handling opponents.<br><br>After picking a team, the player can choose one of the four car makers available: <i>Lizard</i> and <i>Assoluto</i> keep the old RR tradition of cars drifting wildly on corners, but <i>Age Solo</i> and <i>Terrazi</i> offer a new experience with their &quot;Grip&quot; cars that require more breaking and careful trajectories, but are easier to control during turns.<br><br>The player earns (and so, unlocks for free play) cars by completing races; however, final placement defines how good the car will be. By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the <i>Shooting Hoops</i> speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked.<br><br><i>R4 Ridge Racer Type 4</i> also includes an extra disk, featuring the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=711719243724\">Ridge Racer</a> in higher resolution. For a time, the game was also sold as a bundle along Namco's innovative Jogcon controller.",
