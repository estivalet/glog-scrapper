  "description": "A simulation of the classic game of the same name. As you can imagine from the name, this is a no-frills game, but it still comes with three modes, (normal, special, and quest) and multiplayer options. (1-4 players, with computer players as desired.)<br><br>Normal mode is the regular bowling game, but special mode sets up 45 pins instead of the usual 10. Quest mode, on the other hand, randomly places 3 pins in the lane, creating a more strategic play.",
