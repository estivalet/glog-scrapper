  "description": "<i>Paca Paca Passion</i> is the first title in the rhythm game series from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Produce+Co%2e%2c+Ltd%2e\">Produce</a>, and is a conversion of the 1998 coin-op title of the same name. Choose from one of four members of band: keyboard and brass-playing bunny girl Purika, guitar-shredder-with-blue-hair Coke, sun-loving pianist Miruka, or afroed drum machine Geroppa, and battle against one of your bandmates to see who can jam better. Each person plays a different instrument on each track, and different instruments correspond to different difficulties on each song.<br><br>Each player has a column divided into 32 sections. Each section can either be gray (indicating no note), or one of four colors (each assigned to a button). A marker scrolls down the column in time with the music, and you must press the buttons for the markers to play each note. Play better than your opponent and you'll win the song and continue to the next one, where you once more pick a band member and instrument.<br><br>The game includes Original and Arcade modes, as well as 2-player Battle and Cooperative play.",
