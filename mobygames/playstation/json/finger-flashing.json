  "description": "Finger Flashing is a puzzler which can best be described as a rock-paper-scissors action puzzle game. You pick one of the two characters available then head out to defeat monsters, using either your wand if you play as Poi or a rocket launcher if you play as Cyikke.<br><br>The game mechanics are similar that of a falling block puzzle, but here you walk along a straight stage and meet monsters instead of them coming to you. Your character always walks forward, but you can set the speed he'll walk in by pressing the L1/R1 buttons. The enemies in the game are mainly made up of walking, mutated hands and in order to dispose of them you need to shoot them with the right kind of finger gesture to make them disappear.<br><br>The game features several game modes, such as Story, Score Attack (with a timer), Time Trial and Battle, where you can play against a friend.",
