  "description": "<i>Power Dolls 2</i> is a turn-based mecha-themed tactical game set in a futuristic scenario of the 26th century. Like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/power-dolls\">predecessor</a>, the game focuses on the war between the planets Omni and Earth. The player commands the all-female Detachment Of Limited Line Service (&quot;Dolls&quot;) squad and can opt for going through the campaign in a linear fashion or directly select specific missions from the main menu.<br><br>The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous game, with some interface-related and customization additions (such as more detailed ways to outfit mechas). The player must build a team out of several available pilots, assigning a mecha or another type of craft (plane, mobile rocket-launcher, etc.) depending on the type of mission and its requirements. The player then proceeds to the actual mission, navigating squad members in turn-based fashion through a top-down area. Like in the first game, tactical considerations (pre-mission choices, positioning of team members, etc.) sometimes carry more weight than actual armed confrontations with the enemy.",
