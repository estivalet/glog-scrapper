  "description": "<i>WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game</i> merges the personalities and action of the WWF TV show characters with a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret &quot;Hit Man&quot; Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.<br><br>Although presented as a wrestling title, this game is structured like a one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF. Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer.",
