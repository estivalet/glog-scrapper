  "description": "Virtual Pool is the definitive pool simulation game that actually teaches novice players how to play and even promises to improve the game of the pool shark. Developed by a team of physicists and professional pool players, Virtual Pool brings the game to life with the highest degree of accuracy. Balls roll, skid, collide and move on a fully rendered 3D controlled pool table that mirrors reality. <br><br>Virtual Pool has revolutionary features that allow players to actually 'walk' around the table to check out their next shot, take a closer look, back away, look left or right and then line-up the shot like they would in a real game with a real table. This title also allows players to take an overhead view from above, something unavailable in a real pool game! <br><br>Taking game tips from World Champion pool player &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Lou Butera is guaranteed to improve the player's game. &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Lou will teach players over 30 famous trick shots the player can practice on their computer screen and then implement on a real table.
