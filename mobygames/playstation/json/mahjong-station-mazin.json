  "description": "<i>MAZIN</i> is an early full-3D mahjong game. Ten heroes from the past and present, including a Greek warrior, a wild-west gunman, a 15th-century Romanian vampire, and a retro-futuristic robot, have been gathered together by the gods for a mahjong tournament. The game faithfully reproduces the 4-player variation of the ancient tile game, mixed with a highly-animated anime style where every move is reason to shout.<br><br>The game includes two modes. In Campaign Mode, the player takes control of a young man named Katsuya Ibuki and must prove his worth to the God of Mahjong. There is also a Free Battle mode where the player can choose any character to play as. In addition to the featured 3D &quot;Virtual&quot; mode, there is also a &quot;Standard&quot; 2D mode that ditches the extra animations and voiceovers to streamline the gameplay.",
