Also on the same flight is Veltor Curtis who is being secretly watched by Chris Lanebecca, a female investigator. Soon after arriving at the airport, Veltor is attacked, Acarno tries to help, but his efforts are in vain. But then Veltor throws a small capsule to Acarno who then escapes from the airport. And then his adventure will truly begin.<br><br>Like the first game, <i>Overblood 2</i> has full 3-D levels, however there are now some pre-rendered locations in the game. You can play as three characters in the game - Acarno, Chris and a third character named Navarro Jean.",
