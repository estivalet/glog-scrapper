  "description": "<i>Dance:UK: eXtra Trax</i> follows in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/danceuk\">Dance:UK</a> and it's gameplay is virtually identical in every respect. It too takes the standard 'bemani' formula - arrows appear rhythmically on screen and the player must hit the corresponding button (on either a dance mat peripheral or the standard controller) in time with these arrows and the music. Points are awarded for accuracy with extras for making certain 'combos' (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long).<br><br>The original game PS1 version of the game had twenty tracks, this game has just twelve. It can be played in either Aerobic mode, which calculates but does not record the number of calories you've burnt during play, or Dance mode.<br><br>Dance mode can be played in head-to-head, multiplayer or jukebox modes and has four three difficulty levels, beginner, easy, medium and expert. Head to head requires two controllers while the other two require just the one. <br>\nIn all modes the player can either select the track they wish to dance to or let the game select a random track, jukebox mode also has a dance recorder function, which does not have to be unlocked as it did in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/danceuk\">Dance:UK</a>, but when the player dances to the playback the score is not recorded in the high score table.<br><br>Though the game is intended to be used with a dance mat it can be played using a standard controller. There is an optional karaoke feature which shows the words of the song while the player is dancing, the words do not show during the dance recording or playback features.\n",
