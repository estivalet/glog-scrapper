  "description": "So you wanna be a bounty hunter, eh? Let me tell ya somethin', kid...it ain't easy. But I'll teach ya. Name's Jet Black. You're aboard my ship, the Bebop. My partners are Spike Spiegel and Faye Valentine. We're bounty hunters.<br><br>So this is what you'll be doin'. When there's a bounty to be had, we'll be flyin' out to catch it. For that purpose, we've got ourselves a couple of small fighting ships: my Hammerhead, Spike's Swordfish II, and our Redtail. We'll give you one of them to try out, but you'd better damn well take care of it. Get out there, catch a few bounties, and perhaps we can eat something for dinner other than bell peppers and beef, minus the beef...<br><br>This game is based on the famous anime of the same name, and is a Japan only release.",
