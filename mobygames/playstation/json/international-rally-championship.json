  "description": "International Rally Championship is a follow up to Europess's previous rally simulation game 'Rally Championship'. International Rally Championship offers 16 new tracks set in various locations around the world from the deserts of Egypt to the rainforests of Brazil. There are various modes of play including arcade, time trial, simulation (a full rally season in which you drive on every track), championship (race on various tracks on various levels of difficulty) and custom mode in which you get to set up the race using various settings such as weather conditions and the number of cars which will actually take part in the race.\nAnother excellent feature of the game is a track editor in which you get to create your own tracks. You are able to customize your own tracks from being able to set how steep the hills will be to what the track's surface will be (tarmac, gravel, etc).",
