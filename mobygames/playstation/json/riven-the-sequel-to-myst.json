  "description": "After the Stranger has rescued Atrus, the master of &quot;linking books&quot;, from the imprisonment caused by his sons, a new task awaits the hero. Atrus's wife, Catherine, has been taken by Gehn, his own father. Gehn has appointed himself as the one to rule the Age of Riven, and has driven his world to collapse. Now he holds Catherine hostage on Riven, hoping that his son will restore the book link to the Age and free him from there. The Stranger is requested by Atrus to travel to Riven and find a way to rescue Catherine.<br><br><i>Riven</i> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=myst\"> Myst</a>, and is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay style, controls, and visual presentation. The game world is presented as a series of computer-generated still screens; the player explores it in a point-and-click fashion. Interaction with the environment is possible only when said environment is highlighted as a &quot;hot spot&quot;, and is also performed by simple clicking. Like its predecessor, <i>Riven</i> is heavy on puzzles, which rarely include using inventory items, but usually involve understanding and manipulating the complex environments and machinery of the game world.
