  "description": "Mr. Driller's world has been covered with mysterious blocks. Armed with only a mighty drill, you'll have to dig your way down to safety before his air supply runs out!<br><br><i>Mr. Driller</i> is a real-time puzzle game that relies solely on quick-thinking and a bit of planning. The gameplay is a combination of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tetris\">Tetris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a>: You have to drill down through multi-colored blocks to reach the bottom while avoiding the consequences of reckless drilling; blocks left without a foundation will drop down after a while, potentially crushing Mr. Driller. As the hero's air supply is depleted with time, the player must regularly grab oxygen pick-ups. Some of the blocks are &quot;X-Blocks&quot;, which take a few tries to drill through and take away a large chunk of the player's air if destroyed. If four or more X-Blocks come in contact with each other, they vanish and leave behind a small blue creature &quot;Chisokojin&quot;, which grants 765 points when picked up. <br><br>There are two scenarios in the game, the &quot;2500ft&quot; and &quot;5000ft challenge&quot; (called &quot;500m&quot; and &quot;1000m&quot; in the Japanese version), which are five and ten levels long respectively.
