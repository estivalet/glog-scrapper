  "description": "<i>Crisis Beat</i> is your typical 3D side-scrolling game, but with more features. It has rendered cinematics and real-time 3D scenes. The characters have their own voices, and their designs gives them an anime look. Also, you get to choose your character from 2 pairs, so their story begins differently.<br><br>The story takes place aboard a ship called the &quot;Princess of the\nFearless&quot;, which gets sea-jacked by a group of Terrorists, led by\nColonel Whigen. Your character will then have to fight through the\ndifferent areas aboard the ship in an attempt to stop the Terrorists.<br><br>The fighting heavily emphasizes combos and air juggles, and the use of background objects to attack your opponents, in a totally different way to most beat 'em ups. Also, the new Lock-On Counter system separates the game from the normal beat'em ups.\n",
