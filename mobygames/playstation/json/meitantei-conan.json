  "description": "<i>Meitantei Conan</i> (??????) also known as <i>Detective Conan</i> is an adventure game based on anime and manga with the same title. While this is not the first <i>Meitantei Conan</i> game to be released, it is the first of many such adventure games on consoles. The game contains two original new cases which can be played in any order and contains anime style opening movies for each of the cases. The game uses top-down perspective with artwork showing side view to achieve bird's perspective presentation. In both episodes, the player directly controls Conan which can move up, down, left, or right, and can talk to other characters or interact with current locations and on-screen objects. As the case story progresses, many puzzle oriented mini-games will also become available.<br><br><b>Doukyuusei Satsujin Jiken (???????) case</b><br>\nConan, together with Ran Mouri and her father Kogorou Mouri, whom Conan had made a great detective, come to visit a girl student who received a threatening letter. While they were investigating the case, an actual murder has occurred. A seemingly unrelated to the threatening letter schoolgirl has been killed. Conan isn't wasting a minute on letting Kogorou try and solve it and is already looking for clues, questioning suspects, and trying to make the deduction that will uncover the motive behind the murder and the real culprit responsible for it.<br><br><b>Kotou no Takaramono Jiken (???????) case</b><br>\nBoys detective club comprised of Conan Edogawa (whose real name is Shinichi Kudo), Ayumi Yoshida, Genta Kojima, and Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, have come to visit Ayumi's uncle. As they were playing on a yacht at the pier, Ayumi's uncle was paid a visit by a suspicious looking woman that apparently riled him up so he left the kids to play alone for a while. Before long they find themselves riding a huge waves on a rough sea which caused Conan to fall overboard. When he woke up, he found himself on an isolated island with yacht debris covering the shore and his friends missing. This in turn will turn into a quest for a secret treasure, but the island will also test Conan's survival skills.",
