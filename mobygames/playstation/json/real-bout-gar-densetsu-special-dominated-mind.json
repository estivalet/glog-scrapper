  "description": "A PSX-only Fatal Fury released as a conversion of sorts to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/real-bout-fatal-fury-special\">Real Bout Fatal Fury Special</a>. The game uses the same engine and general mechanics of said arcade game, but takes place outside of the main storyline a la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/street-fighter-alpha-3\">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a> and includes brand new and exclusive characters like a back from the dead Geese and a new end-game boss: White.<br><br>The gameplay is virtually identical to <i>Real Bout Fatal Fury Special</i>, except that the action is much faster, the super-combo system is somewhat simplified and the foreground/background system has been ditched. New to the series is the addition of cel-animated cutscenes that play during key moments, and the game also offers a 2 player mode and a series of extra features like galleries, a Fatal Fury encyclopedia and new moves when you complete the game under certain circumstances.",
