  "description": "This was one of three games released as a tie-in to the 20th anniversary re-release in theaters of the movie E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.\nAs the title suggests this is an action game, though of course with E.T. as the protagonist, it is a bloodless one.<br><br>The story here follows E.T. as he is returning home in his spaceship, and makes stopovers on several planets to pick rare and exotic plant specimens, with the ultimate goal to save the universe through this action. Some of the plants are dying and need healing, saving enough (20 pcs) plants also gives an extra life to E.T.  He can also pick up and carry smaller items, like keys, one at a time. Being an action game, E.T. has the ability to run when needed.<br><br>E.T. will meet other aliens, the native inhabitants of the planets he visits, who are opposed to his collecting of their endangered species, but E.T. has special powers to help him: Telekinesis to move blocking objects, Healing power to resurrect the dying plants, a 'Heart Stun' that stops opponents in their tracks - and he can also get a health item from weaker creatures with this method.\n",
