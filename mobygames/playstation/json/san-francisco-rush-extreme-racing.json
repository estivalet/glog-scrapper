  "description": "For the N64 version of the arcade hit, Midway added all-new courses and shortcuts. All six courses can be run in reverse, mirrored, or mirrored and reversed. There's even two hidden stunt courses! Graphically, the game sacrifices detail in favor of blindingly fast screen redraws.  <br><br>The gameplay is very arcade-like: You fly through the air with the greatest of ease, and when you hit a wall your car bursts into flames.  You can customize your car with different colors, racing stripes, tire rims and much more.",
