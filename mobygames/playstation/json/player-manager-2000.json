  "description": "A football management game from the creators of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kick+Off\">Kick Off</a> series. <em>Player Manager 2000</em> lets the player coach any team from England, Scotland, Italy, and Germany, and there is totally more than 30,000 players. Tactical options are diverse and the game features both pre- and post-match analysis.<br><br>What makes the game relatively unique is players are able to put themselves in the team. There are three ways to play the matches. The first is the commentary mode, which works almost the same way as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Championship+Manager+series\">Championship Manager</a> games. The second is the scanner mode, where the player can watch the matches from a 2D, top-down view. The third is to play these matches in full 3D, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=FIFA\">FIFA</a> games.",
