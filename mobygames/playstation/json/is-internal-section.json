  "description": "<i>iS: internal section</i> is a &quot;tube shooter&quot; in the tradition of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tempest\">Tempest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/stun-runner\">S.T.U.N. Runner</a>. The game uses flat shaded, untextured polygons to keep a high frame rate in the PlayStation's high resolution mode. Players have access to twelve different weapons, each named after a sign of the Chinese zodiac. The in-game soundtrack is techno, and much like SCEI's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/vib-ribbon\">Vib-Ribbon</a>, <i>iS</i> can dynamically change the environments based off of music from inserted CDs in certain modes. The game is very similar in terms of gameplay and style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rez\">Rez</a>, and actually was released nearly 3 years earlier. ",
