  "description": "Nobita can't take it any more! His teacher yells at him at school, his mom yells at him at home, his friends make fun of him, and the girl he likes is spending her time with someone else. He runs home to Doraemon, begging him to find a place where he can hide from the world.<br><br>Doraemon uses one of his famous tools from the future and finds a hidden cave, deep underground. However, they soon stumble on an ancient altar and wind up releasing a strange (but friendly) creature named Bit. Nobita's friends find out, but when they head back into the cave, an ancient demon appears and kidnaps everyone but Nobita. Now he must explore the cave and find a way to rescue his friends!<br><br><i>Makai no Dungeon</i> is a dungeon-crawling roguelike in the tradition of Chunsoft's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Fushigi+no+Dungeon+games\">Mysterious Dungeon</a> series, and one of many games based on the popular children's cartoon <i>Doraemon</i>. It plays just like its better-known cousin, featuring randomly-generated dungeons, and a turn-based action system where each action the player takes is also an action for all enemies.<br><br>The goal is to explore each of the dungeons and rescue Nobita's friends, who will become playable as they are found. Each level of each dungeon is filled with various items, traps, and enemies. There is also a PocketStation mini-game included, where the player can earn extra items to help in the main game.",
