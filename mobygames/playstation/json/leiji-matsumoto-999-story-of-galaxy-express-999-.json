  "description": "Based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Leiji+Matsumoto\">Leiji Matsumoto's</a> universe (&quot;Leijiverse&quot;), the game mixes up the story of the anime classic &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; with various characters and subplots from other Matsumoto's comic books (including &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;, &quot;Queen Emeraldas&quot;, &quot;Drifting Express 000&quot;, &quot;Time Sweeper Mahoroba&quot; or &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; - aka &quot;Starblazers&quot;)<br><br>You assume the role of Tetsurô Hoshino, a young boy that witnesses the murder of his mother by Count Mecha, a cyborg who hunts humans for sport. In his quest for revenge, Tetsurô meets Maetel, a mysterious lady who offers him a pass for the prestigious &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, a space train that travels from Earth to the Andromeda galaxy. There Tetsurô could get a mechanized body for free and thus be able to challenge Count Mecha...<br><br>The game itself is a 3D adventure with lots of dialogs (dubbed by the original japanese cast of the series) and some action scenes.",
