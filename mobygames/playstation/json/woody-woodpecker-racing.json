  "description": "<i>Woody Woodpecker Racing</i> is a go-kart racing game based on the popular cartoon character Woody Woodpecker.<br><br>The player selects one of the six starting characters from the series (including three differently styled Woodys, Wally Walrus and others) and races in a style reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-kart\">Super Mario Kart</a> (including &quot;jump turns&quot; for sharper angles). The player can collect items from boxes and try to slow down the opponents while driving through a 3D environment, with slopes, ramps and jumps, on tarmac or mud. Quest, championship, time trial and single race modes are available, as players try to hone their skills and unlock new characters and tracks.",
