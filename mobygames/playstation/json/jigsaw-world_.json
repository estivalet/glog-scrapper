  "description": "<i>Jigsaw World</i> is a jigsaw puzzle game, and the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pieces\">Jigsaw Party</a>. Much like its predecessor, it combines the jigsaw puzzle with elements of arcade puzzle games, tasking two players (or a player and the computer) with solving a set of puzzles as quickly as possible. Pieces are supplied to each player in a specific order, and there are also power-ups that can be used to hinder the other player.<br><br>The main attraction is the <i>Alice in Jigsaw Land</i> story mode, a parody of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Fictional+character%3a+Alice+%28in+Wonderland%29\">Lewis Carrol's famous novel</a>, in which the player controls Alice as she competes against a variety of characters in jigsaw puzzle battles.<br><br>In addition to the battle modes, there is also a regular puzzle mode for one player. There are over 100 puzzles, including both photographs and illustrations, each of which can be played as either a 24, 96, or 150 piece puzzle.",
