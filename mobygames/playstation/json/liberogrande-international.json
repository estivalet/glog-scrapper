  "description": "<i>Liberogrande International</i> (or <i>Liberogrande 2</i> in Japan) is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Libero+Grande\">Libero Grande</a>. Like its predecessor, it is an unconventional soccer game where instead of a complete team, only a single player is directly controlled, with the other 10 players being controlled by the AI, although with the option to influence their choice in plays. However, unlike the original title, <i>Liberogrande International</i> is a home console title, and along featuring a more realistic visual presentation, it's now possible to choose formation and pick any player (including goalkeeper and the title-mentioned <i>libero</i>) to control, instead of being limited to play as either right-wing or playmaker, depending on the predefined team formation.<br><br>Gameplay remains mostly unchanged; the camera follows the ball, circling around the controlled player. When the player is carrying the ball, he can do the usual actions (pass, shoot, cross, throw a long pass), while keeping an eye on other players asking the ball and running into space. With possession but without the ball the player can ask for either a low or an high pass. Without the ball, the player can either tackle or instruct other players when to attack the ball, if this option is enabled. At the end of the match, the player can see how well he performed, along a &quot;heat map&quot; on his positioning.<br><br>Since all players are now given equal billing, the player can now edit all 32 national team players' names, as well as creating his own superstar (which can be used on any national team). Game modes include exhibition (where you can play with or against a friend in split-screen mode), LiberoGrande Cup (straight elimination cup), International Cup (World Cup style tournament) and World League.<br><br>Unlike the Japanese version, the European one doesn't feature commentary.",
