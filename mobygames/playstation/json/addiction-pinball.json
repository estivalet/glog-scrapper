  "description": "<i>Addiction Pinball</i> consists of two tables based on other computer games by the same developer: \n<ul><li>World Rally (based on the anime racing game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/world-rally-fever-born-on-the-road\">World Rally Fever: Born on the Road</a></li>\n<li>Worms (after the popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Worms\">series</a> of invertebrate combat games)</li></ul>\nEach table has most of the features found on modern pinball games including multiball, a &quot;video&quot; display, bumping, up-table flippers, and challenge modes.  The tables do however lack some configuration options expected by pinball fans (most notably: balls per game, playfield angle and replay score).",
