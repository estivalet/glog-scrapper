  "description": "A side-scrolling &quot;cute'em up&quot;, Harmful Park puts you in the shoes of the two daughters of a well-meaning inventor that sends her daughters in weapon-loaded, flying hoverbikes to retake the &quot;Heartful Park&quot; which has been taken over by one of its creators and has turned all of its attractions into mechanical beasts.<br><br>As mentioned, the game uses a cute graphic design with colorful 2D artwork, gameplay involves shooting your way past 6 stages themed as park attractions. You have at your disposal 4 different weapons selectable at any moment and which can be individually powered-up by collecting the right items. Additionally each weapon has its &quot;super&quot; attack which has a limited number of uses.<br><br>Features 2-player cooperative gameplay in the main game as well as three different competitive mini-games, such as a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pong\">Pong</a> clone (with the bikes replacing the paddles) a racing game and a four-player tank combat game.",
