  "description": "<i>Taiwan Mahjong: F?ng Chéng Zh? Zhàn F?ngyún Zàiq?</i> is a mahjong simulator which follows traditional Taiwanese rules. Unlike most other variants, which traditionally feature hands of 13 tiles, Taiwanese rules notably use hands of 16 tiles and this rule is prominently featured in this game. Although there isn't a story mode, there are a variety of AI opponents to choose from who each feature unique personalities and play styles. Aside from some standard cosmetic configuration options, players are also given a detailed set of several dozen rule options to tweak gameplay to their liking.",
