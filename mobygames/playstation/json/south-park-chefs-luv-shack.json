  "description": "Chef hosts <i>South Park: Chef's Luv Shack</i>, which mixes South Park trivia with over 20 mini games in the mold of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mario-party\">Mario Party</a>. Most of the mini games are parodies of classic arcade games.  The player chooses a South Park character (Kyle, Kenny, Stan, or Cartman) and answers the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If the player gets it right, they then spin a wheel, and get either cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by themselves, against the AI, or against other players if playing in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.\n",
