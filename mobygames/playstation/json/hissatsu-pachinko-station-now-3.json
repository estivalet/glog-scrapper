  "description": "<i>Hissatsu Pachinko Station Now 3</i> is the third in a series of pachinko games from Japan. <br><br>Pachinko is sometimes referred to as the number one pastime in Japan, and it is played in gaming halls called parlors. Gambling for money is illegal in Japan so players purchase steel balls with which they play the game. At the end of their session they exchange their remaining balls for tokens which, in turn, can be exchanged for goods / prizes.",
