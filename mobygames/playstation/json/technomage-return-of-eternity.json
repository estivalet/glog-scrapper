  "description": "The fantasy world of Gothos is populated by two kinds of people: the Dreamers, who are capable of using magic, and the Steamers, whose civilization relies on technology. The two peoples live in separate areas, mistrust each other, and usually avoid contact. But more often than not, natural human feelings are stronger than anything else. A Steamer man and a Dreamer woman fell in love with each other, and the fruit of their passion was a boy whom they named Melvin. The latter grew up in Dreamertown, disliked and suspected by its inhabitants because of his mixed blood. As monsters suddenly attacked the town, Melvin was blamed for it, and expelled from his homeland. He decides to venture into the land of the Steamers and find his missing father. Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long and perilous journey, during which Melvin will become a true hero.<br><br><i>TechnoMage: Return of Eternity</i> is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of adventure, role-playing, and action-based combat.
