Many types of machines were created using this technology, including powered suits called &quot;component muscle&quot; that give the wearer incredible running speed. However, because of misuse of this technology, it was outlawed for general use and is now reserved only for military purposes...and for a famous sports tournament called Running High.<br><br><i>Running High</i> is a high-speed futuristic foot-race game for one player. There are six racers to choose from, and three tracks (with a fourth unlocked after clearing the first three). Each racer has different abilities, and all of them will play dirty in trying to be the first to the finish. You can attack the other racers with punches, knock them down, and vault over them.",
