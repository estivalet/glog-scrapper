  "description": "<i>Bishi Bashi Special</i> is a compilation (and conversion) of the Konami arcade titles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bishi+Bashi+Champ\">Bishi Bashi Champ</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-bishi-bashi-champ\">Super Bishi Bashi Champ</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Handle+Champ\">Handle Champ</a>.<br><br>Gameplay is made up of tons of mini games, all of which use a simple 3-button interface that mimics the arcade originals. The mini games encompass a wide variety of button-mashing, timing and button combination games. The games themselves can be anything from making hamburgers, throwing a pie down a church aisle to balancing a car on a floating narrow gravel road and much more.<br><br>The game can be played alone, vs a computer player or play up to eight people using a multi-tap and three controllers.",
