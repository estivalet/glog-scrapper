  "description": "After failing with a monkey-making scheme, Pucky Duck and Buster Bunny only have a single pouch of magic beans left. Just like in the fairytale, a huge beanstalk emerges from the beans and open up new worlds and - supposedly - greast treasures. The player takes control over Plucky while they explore eight different areas in a scavenger hunt based on nursery rhymes.  Prizes include the goose that laid the golden eggs and a fabled, priceless harp. The comical quest takes our heroes through classic nursery rhyme locations based on <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, <i>The Three Bears</i>, <i>Old Mother Hubbard</i> and more.<br><br>The game consists of two parts: First are the sequences on the beanstalk where Plucky tries to reach the next treasure location. Those are platforming sections in which the end of the screen needs to be reached without dying to one of the many obstacles, for example by rolling to the side when a weight appears and threatens to bury Plucky. An optional hard difficulty adds additional hazards and traps.<br><br>When the clue locations are reached, the game becomes a point &amp; click adventure. Based on a clue provided by Babs Bunny, Plucky needs to find the correct item to click on. Each location consists of a single screen and has a number of optional hot-spots which launch animations.\nWhen the the item was found, Plucky receives part of a key; three parts of a key open up the chance to steal a valuable prize from the mysterious giant. <br><br>",
