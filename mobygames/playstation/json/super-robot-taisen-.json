The ship is repaired and its technology reverse-engineered, becoming the flagship SDF Macross in preparation of an attack on Earth. Just eight years later, their worst fears come to reality, with the Neo Zeon Army launching an all-out attack on Earth.<br><br><i>Super Robot Taisen ?</i> is one of the many titles in Banpresto's mecha-crossover tactical RPG series, and the first release in the <i>Alpha</i> sub-series, which was the first major reboot of the franchise after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-robot-wars-f-final\">F Final</a> ended the original storyline.
