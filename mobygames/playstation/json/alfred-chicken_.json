  "description": "Oh no!  Alfred's girlfriend Floella has been chicknapped by the malevolent MekaChicken!  Navigate Alfred through worlds of cheese, playing cards, children's toy blocks and more weird locations as he pursues MekaChicken and defeats an army of psychotic snails along the way.<br><br><i>Alfred Chicken</i> is based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-alfred-chicken\">1993 game</a> of the same name.  It features updated polygonal graphics and a CD quality soundtrack, in addition to all-new levels.  However, the basic gameplay is the same - guide Alfred through action-packed platform levels and snatch up as many gems as you can along the way.<br><br>Peck at the balloons strewn throughout the levels to release them - once you've released them all, you can progress to the next level.  A watering can is also hidden in each level - collect these for Alfred's friend Mr. Peckles, who is (naturally) a gigantic smiling sunflower. Doing so will score Alfred a bonus for the level.",
