  "description": "Milano is a girl who's just moved away from home. With a new home and no money or furniture she quickly puts two and two together. She needs to work to make money in order to decorate her new house to her liking!<br><br>The game is more or less broken up into a few different components. One of them being the part time jobs Milano has to take, which play out like mini games. They can be anything, from button mashing games where she has to clean dishes, to side scrolling action game when she needs to milk flying cows or arcade style puzzle gaming when she's working at a bakery making cakes.<br><br>The other two main parts of the game are the stat building, which is done at Milano's house by doing things like eating food, cleaning, getting a shower and so on. And the final is the reward for all the hard work... the decorating of the house! With the money earned Milano can go through a furniture catalogue and pick out things she likes and can afford. Then the player gets to place the items in the home for her.<br><br>In the beginning of the game there are only a few jobs available, but more are unlocked as Milano works her way through the game.",
