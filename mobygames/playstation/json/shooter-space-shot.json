  "description": "Ace fighter pilots Cyber, Nigo, and Wells have been sent on a mission by the Republic Special Forces to destroy a secret weapon before it is completed. Between missions the three pilots will chat about the status of the mission as well as other topics in FMV cutscenes.<br><br>The player's craft is equipped with two Vulcan guns. Two additional Vulcan guns are attached to FANG extensions, which operate similarly to the options of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Gradius+series\">Gradius games</a>. Additionally the ship can fire a very powerful Over Drive beam or turn invulnerable and dash through enemies and bullets with the Booster. Both can be used to start a bonus chain counter to earn additional points, and both also increase the Over Drive Gauge which will cause the ship to overheat and lose functionality if filled. Unlike most scrolling shooter games the player's ship can withstand several hits before it is destroyed.",
