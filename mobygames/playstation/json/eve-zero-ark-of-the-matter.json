  "description": "<i>Eve Zero</i> is a prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/eve-burst-error\">Eve Burst Error</a>. Once again, the player controls the two main heroes of the series: the witty and womanizing private investigator Kojiroh Amagi, and the beautiful red-haired secret agent Marina. The events of the game take place shortly before those of <i>Eve Burst Error</i>. Kojiroh is working at Katsuragi Detective Office together with his girlfriend Yayoi. Dr. Nishina, the head of a genetic research facility, hires Kojiroh to investigate the disappearance of his son Shin. At the same time, Marina receives an assignment from her boss Kohno, which involves watching over a representative of an American company. As in all EVE games, the two stories appear unrelated in the beginning and are gradually linked together later in the game.<br><br>The player needs to switch between the two protagonists frequently in order to advance in the game. The interface consists of a menu that makes it possible to interact with the game world. Beside the traditional &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, and &quot;Go&quot; commands, there are many others, specific to the situation. Being a Japanese-style adventure game, <i>Eve Zero</i> does not feature any puzzles.",
