Race through 11 tracks filled with loops and danger chargers.<br><br>Cars and tracks are unlocked as you play, either by winning races or performing stunt flips, side rolls and combos. Two player races can either be pure head-to-head, or also feature the computer cars. The soundtrack is rock-based, including tracks by Metallica and Primus.",
