  "description": "<i>Small Brawl</i> steps in a different direction from other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Twisted+Metal\">Twisted Metal</a> games, with all the characters from them represented as children at school getting bullied by Calypso, who wants them to enter his contest and win a ultimate prize. The kids from Calypso's school (like Thumper,Auger and Sweet Tooth) enter Calypso's contest so they can quit his bullying and win his prize. <br><br>All the characters build life-like remote control cars ranging from a ice cream truck, to a hearse so they can fight each other with weapons ranging from chewing gum to firecrackers, toothpicks to flaming barbie heads so they may win. <br><br>The physics engine is from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/twisted-metal-2\">Twisted Metal 2</a> Small Brawl's battlegrounds include tree houses, putt-putt courses, and in bowling allies. These have no hidden areas, but there are lots of unlockables. Tournament (defeat 8 enemies and 2 bosses), Endurance (survive the carnage as long as you can) and Challenge (take on / out a specific rival) modes are included, with multiplayer Co-Op and Head-to-Head modes.",
