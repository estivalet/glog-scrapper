  "description": "A computer virus is spreading and infecting the operating systems in Labors around the city, and as the newest member of Tokyo Metropolitan Police Special Vehicles Section 2 it's the player's task, along with the rest of the unit, to try to find the cause and make sure it's dealt with before things get out of hand.<br><br><i>Kid? Keisatsu Patlabor: Game Edition</i> is a blend of two distinctly different styles of gameplay; It divides the game into Visual Novel sections as well as action where the player fights criminals and infected Labors in the city while piloting AV-98 Ingram-3, the police's own labor mecha. <br><br>The visual novel parts of the game contain no interaction with the game and are meant to convey the bulk of the story in the game. These act as the first and last part of each chapter, with the fight section in between. The action sections has the player face off against other labor mechas in various parts of the city. The action leans towards a tactical style of play, where the player needs to let an action bar fill up completely before he/she is able to do any offensive moves against the opponent. In the meantime, the only option is to find a good position from which to rush in and attack, while blocking and avoiding the enemy attacks. The AV-98 Ingram-3 is equipped with a gun, which can be used a limited number of times to fire at the opponent from a distance. The player needs to stand still and aim before firing the gun, and a direct hit causes damage and that the enemy falls over for a short period of time. The biggest part of the fighting is made up of grappling the opponent and trying to rack up high combos of punches, kicks and throws. The longer the chain, the more damage is dealt. Certain attacks will break the chain, so it's important to choose the attacks correctly. Hitting the opponent is done by timing button presses to visual cues on screen.<br><br>As the game progresses, 3D models of the defeated opponents can be viewed in a special gallery from the main menu of the game, along with information about the respective labor mecha.",
