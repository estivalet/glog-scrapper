  "description": "Jack Fremont is an ordinary guy with just one unique talent: his knowledge of TV shows. Otherwise, his life isn't going too well, and he is about to be evicted from his place. However, one day, bragging about his encyclopedic abilities, Jack is confronted by two CIA agents who tell him that a powerful terrorist is about to destroy Los Angeles. Apparently, the terrorist was uncredited in some TV shows and resorted to violence in protest. Now it's up to Jack to stop him and save the city.<br><br><i>Fox Hunt</i> is a spy comedy that heavily relies on live-action full-motion video to advance the plot. The gameplay is restricted to interludes between the movies, and features both adventure and action elements. In some places the player has to explore rooms and find items, while others are built like action sequences. There is a time limit in many of these episodes, and a few branching story arcs.",
