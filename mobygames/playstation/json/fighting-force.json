  "description": "<i>Fighting Force</i> is a 3D fighting &quot;beat-em-up&quot; in which the player can choose to control one of the four available characters. Each of the characters has his or her own advantages and weaknesses (e.g. superior strength but slow movement), and each possesses a powerful special move that depletes their health. Besides fists, they can use objects such as chairs, trash cans, and car tires, and weapons such as knives to fight the minions of the evil criminal mastermind Dr. Zeng who aspires to control the city.
