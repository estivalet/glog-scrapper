  "description": "<i>Riot</i> is a futuristic sports game. The court is a hall similar to a basketball field but the basket is in the middle. The goal is to throw a charged energy ball into the basket. It is charged in energy fields that are placed in the opponent's half. There are three areas which give a different amount of points. The team which has the most points when the game is over wins. <br><br>Every team consists of six players which have different scores in condition, speed, power and accuracy. Occasionally appearing power ups give a boost to one ability. There are no rules against attacking the opponent's players. 23 camera angles, including top down and directly behind the used player, can be used during the game.<br><br>There are three playing modes: Exhibition matches are a single game between two of the 16 teams. In the second mode, there is a playoff tournament where several player-controlled teams can participate. Only one team can be controlled in the league mode.",
