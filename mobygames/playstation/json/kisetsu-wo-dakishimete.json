Game is virtually a fully animated visual novel which in turn makes it look like an anime where you can affect the story and outcome by different choices during gameplay. The game features voice-acting for all the characters except the protagonist whose words and thoughts are displayed as subtitles during this interactive anime. The game features 27 different endings which are split into 5 good endings, 4 normal endings, and 18 bad endings.<br><br>The story takes place during the time of spring and opens with you walking down the road with your friend, Tomoko, who was harboring a feelings for you for some time. She might have gathered the courage to indirectly opens herself to you and confess, when the moment was abruptly interrupted by your notice of a young girl lying unconscious under the cherry tree. A girl you seem to have known from your high-school days. And it just so happens she lost her memories and doesn't remember anything, including how she got here.",
