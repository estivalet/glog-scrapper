  "description": "In <i>Click Medic</i>, the player takes the role of a doctor who can perform life-saving operations with a tool called the VB Machine. The machine is full of life-saving antibodies, but must be controlled by a human pilot. Thus, doctor and machine are shrunk down and sent inside the patient, <i>Fantastic Voyage</i>-style.<br><br>In the first stage of gameplay, the doctor talks to their patient in order to learn symptoms, make a diagnosis, and ease any medical anxieties the patient may have. The second stage takes place inside the patient's body, in which the VB Machine is sent to find the source of their ailments and fight it in turn-based RPG combat. The player has many different antibodies at their disposal, and needs to choose the correct ones to combat the virus or other bodily threat.<br><br>The player needs to keep an eye on the patient's vitals and the VB Machine's energy levels; if any of them fall too low, the mission will be failed. Additionally, while many different paths can be traveled in order to reach the virus, some paths may cause the patient's vitals to drop or may be incredibly painful to them, while other paths may not open up until others have been explored. It may sometimes be necessary to abort a mission, in order to stabilize the patient from the outside.",
