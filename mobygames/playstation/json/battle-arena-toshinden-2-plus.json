  "description": "<i>Battle Arena Toshinden 2 plus</i> is an updated version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/battle-arena-toshinden-2\">Battle Arena Toshinden 2</a> for the game's re-release on Japan's &quot;The Best&quot; range (equivalent to the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Platinum&quot; ranges in the U.S and E.U).<br><br>It adds no new characters or attacks, rather it polishes and tweaks what is already there by enhancing the graphics (slightly sharper textures, particle effects replace sprite effects), tweaking character balance (with some attacks such as Fo's Mystic Sphere and Duke's Knight Strike having slightly new behaviour) and speed (the game runs notably faster than the Playstation version of the original game).<br><br>Finally, the ability to save unlocked characters, scores and control setups has also been added (this was present in the PC version of Toshinden 2, but not in the Playstation version).",
