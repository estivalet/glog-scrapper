  "description": "The year is 50 B.C.. In the sole, well-known Gaulish village that stands against the Roman oppressors, Chief Vitalstatistix announces a contest to find out who is the bravest, boldest, and strongest Gaul. The volunteers for the contest are Astérix, Obélix, Cacofonix and Mrs. Geriatrix, who compete in a series of different mini-games, split in four days. These range from shooting various objects (and unfortunate pirates and Romans) at a marching Roman army, gathering ingredients for Getafix, eating fast at a feast table while avoiding rotten food items, hunting wild boars, racing with catapults, racing while carrying another Gaul on a shield, demolishing a Roman camp and more. Players can engage in practice mode (play each activity individually), Mega Madness mode (campaign mode with connected activities and cumulative ranking), and team play. Each mini-game can be played by one or two human players.",
