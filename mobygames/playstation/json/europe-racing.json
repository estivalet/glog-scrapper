  "description": "Caesar, a former top driver, now organizes illegal car races and invites the player to join Europe Racer, a race through different European cities. The focus is on the racing itself, but players also need to outrun the police who set up road blocks and try to bump cars off the road.<br><br>The game has been split up into three game modes: Quick Races (single track, duel, time trial, sudden death), Championship and Adventure. Quick Races offers all cars and tracks with different game types, while championship is divided into three sections, for each of the vehicle types: Standard, Sports Car and ATV. Adventure consists of 20 tracks after each other. The European cities included are London, Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, Athens, Hamburg, Stockholm, Rome, Florence, Paris, Amsterdam, Marseille and Moscow. Each city has distinctive landmarks.<br><br>While racing, players can choose to represent a club, based on nationality and with a different car skin. There are more than 30 cars with different speed and handling, from regular cars to sports models and off-road ATVs. During championships vehicles can be upgraded. Players can pick up items while racing, such as boost, repair (cars can be damaged and have a visible damage model), invincibility and cash. The streets are filled with traffic, pedestrians and obstacles. There are different camera perspectives to choose from and there is support for downloadable tracks and cars.",
