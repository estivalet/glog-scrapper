  "description": "That didn't take long. Only a few months after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/slayers-royal\">Slayers Royal</a> and already Lina, Gourry, and an even larger cast of characters will have to save the world yet again. If they don't all kill each other first, of course.<br><br><i>Slayers Royal 2</i> plays similarly to the first game, but with several tweaks. You can no longer look at any object on a town screen, but there is now an event button that will automatically talk to anyone on the screen you're able to talk to. The passage of days from the first game has been expanded to include five times of day, and some events only happen at specific times. In combat the automatic turn system from the first game has been replaced with a more traditional one turn at a time. Terrain now has variable height, and can be raised or lowered with specific spells. Finally a spell's wait time is now reflected in the time it takes a character to cast a spell, making it possible to avoid a spell or attack a caster to prevent the spell from finishing.",
