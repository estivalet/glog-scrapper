  "description": "Puzzle Arena Toshinden takes the furious fighters right out of the ring and into the world of puzzle games! The game plays out much like the Puyo Puyo series by Sega. Connect 3 balloons of the same color to make them disappear. Get combos to have black pieces fall on the opponent's side that are harder to get rid of.<br><br>You can play standard 1-on-1 games, knock out competition where you (and your opponent) each pick 4 characters to see who'll be the last man/woman standing.",
