  "description": "General Storm and his militia are out to take over the world, and it's up to you to stop them. <br><br>Luckily, you are armed with a battalion of tank prototypes. While there are only three different types to choose from at the beginning, the number of choices will grow to 12 as more tanks are discovered throughout the game.<br><br>Play takes place in either the Arcade or Quest modes. Arcade has the player fighting through 10 levels of driving and shooting action, where players can pick up new weapons like laser beams, plasma cannons, and missiles. Between each mission, there is the opportunity to change tanks. <br><br>Quest mode plays the same way, except the player is not given the opportunity to switch vehicles and must drive the same tank through all of the levels. Can General Storm be defeated?",
