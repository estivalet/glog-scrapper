  "description": "<i>Bomberman Wars</i> is an isometric tactical RPG, as opposed to the traditional top-down action/maze games in the franchise.<br><br>There's a story mode, where the main character, King Bomber, rules over the kingdom, but has to fight off Bagular and his soldiers, in order to conquer all land. Gameplay-wise, the player controls the King and his knights, moving the characters around in a grid, with limited moves each turn, as is usual in tactical RPGs.<br><br>This game is one of the first in the series to shift its main focus from multi-player to single player gaming. However, a versus mode is also available in addition to the story mode.",
