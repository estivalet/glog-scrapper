  "description": "<i>Kururin Pa!</i> takes an explosive take on the falling block genre. Players drop pairs of blocks containing string; linking up different blocks of string can produce long lines that cross the playfield. Sometimes, the player will be given a spark of fire instead; lighting up one of the ends of a piece of string will set the entire piece on fire, destroying many pieces at once. In addition to the string, there are a few garbage blocks: snowmen, who melt when adjacent squares are comboed; and two different kinds of bombs, which expand the players' combo abilities.",
