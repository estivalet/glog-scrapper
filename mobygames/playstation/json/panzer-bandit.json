  "description": "An evil robotic army invades city after city and nothing seems to stop them, that is until fighting hero Kou and his band of heroes decide to put the hurt on the invading forces and set off in a quest to liberate each city and finally destroy their flying robotic whale HQ. (Yeah, robotic whale HQ). <br><br>The game prompts you to select from four different characters, each with his/her unique moveset and sends you off for eight enemy-infested stages in which you must use your attacks to pummel everything that crosses your path. You only have two planes of vertical motion, which are mainly used to avoid enemy fire, and the game includes a power-bar that increases with your attacks and allows you to unleash super moves. These moves also increase an overheat gauge which renders you useless for a while, so as to avoid abusing the super moves.<br><br>Features an anime intro and cutscenes, and the game uses 2D sprites with some polygonal elements for background elements.",
