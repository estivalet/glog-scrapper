  "description": "<i>Legend of Legaia</i> is a Japanese-style RPG. Your initial party consists of three characters: Vahn, Noa, and Gala - two males and one female. You engage yourself on a quest of freeing your planet from a mysterious mist which is floating above the planet and which can turn anything it touches into a dreadful monster. In order to clean the planet from the horrible mist, you have to find so-called Genesis Trees which are scattered around on the planet. <br><br>The combat system is a bit similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xenogears\">Xenogears</a>, as it utilizes combo attacks. Your choices aren't just attack, defend or use special abilities: the attack option itself has many choices: high-attack, low-attack, kick etc. Apart from this system, the game is a typical Japanese-style RPG with 3D graphics, anime/manga aesthetics, world map exploration, etc.",
