  "description": "This game features all 29 NBA teams from the 1999-2000 NBA season. The game modes included are Exhibition, Season (28, 56, or 82 games), and Playoffs (either the 5-7-7-7 game series or single elimination format). There is also a Create Dunk mode which lets players create signature dunks by positioning the limbs of the basketball players in all sorts of different ways.<br><br>Game options let the player choose whether to play a sim or arcade type of game, set the difficulty level (rookie, veteran, all-star, or hall of fame), set the quarter length, and whether to turn fatigue, touch shooting, auto replays, and close scores on or off. The game also contains player and league leader stat tracking. Rosters can also be managed with the player being able to edit, trade, sign, and draft basketball players.<br><br>During the game, if players choose to use touch shooting, they will see a\nmeter every time they take a shot at the basket. Depending on what color the meter is when the shot is released will greatly effect the chances of the basket being made. Icon Passing and Icon Cutting make a return from the previous entry of the series. Icon Passing lets the player select which team member they want to get open for a pass while Icon Cutting lets the player select which team member they want to cut towards the basket.\n",
