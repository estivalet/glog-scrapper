  "description": "<i>Shingata Kururin Pa!</i> refines the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kururin-pa\">original game</a>'s formula with a few new features. This time around, if a fire block is dropped in a place where it has nothing to burn, it will smoulder in place until a nearby fire helps it burst into flames; this allows the player to build some much more complex combos. Each character now also has a unique block type with its own effects.",
