  "description": "<i>Afro Ken: The Puzzle</i> is a puzzle game where you control a dog who has to align afros by color and then stomp on them to make them disappear. You have to be quick though, since the water level rises constantly and there are spikes in the ceiling. The only way to keep it down is to constantly make afros disappear. If you manage to get combos, the water goes down even more.<br><br>You can move the afros around one square at the time, much like in a sliding puzzle by walking over them. You have to do this to align the afros in groups of at least four, so you can stomp them. There are also other obstacles to get in your way, such as bombs and big rocks that can't be destroyed very easily.<br><br>The game features the standard puzzle play modes; Timed, versus, endless puzzle and more.",
