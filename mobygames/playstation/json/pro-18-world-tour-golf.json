  "description": "This golf game has TV-style presentation, with commentary by Peter Alliss and Bobby Clampett. Courses and players are photo-realistic, with course layouts accurate to within 3 centimetres. There are no fly-bys, although you can pan around the course to give some clues as to its layout. Four button presses are used to take a shot; draw and fade are set by how long the appropriate press is held down for.<br><br>Several leading players are featured, including Colin Montgomerie and Vijay Singh as well as female and amateur players. There are three courses - Royal County Down, The Lost City and Couer D'Alene (plus Royal Birkdale on the North American edition). ",
