  "description": "Tiny Tank mixes quirky humour, science fiction and action-packed tank battles. The player controls the wisecracking yellow mini-tank of the title. It's up to Tiny Tank to stop the dastardly Mutank and his robot army from decimating what's left of mankind. <br><br>Through 25 intense, varying levels, Tiny Tank rolls, shoots, and quips his way towards victory. Collect nanometal and boost Tiny's powers, collect P-brains to increase smarts, and configure your weapons as you see fit. Tiny can also send out his remote-controlled 'Teeny Weeny Tanks' to scout, gather resources, or provide protection.<br><br>Twelve mission-based levels are accessible and a menacing boss awaits at the end of each, so be prepared! The game also features a 2-Player Versus mode.",
