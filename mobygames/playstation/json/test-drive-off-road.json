  "description": "The <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Test+Drive\">Test Drive series</a> of racing games traditionally involve driving cars on tarmac. However, a sub-series of games involving hazardous racing on less prepared surfaces was commenced with this title.<br><br>Choose from one of four monster trucks (Hummer, Land Rover Defender 90, Jeep Wrangler, and Chevrolet K-1500 Z71), each of which has its own handling as well as realistic damage modeling. Take them through 12 tracks incorporating sand, snow and dirt. In the single-player mode your task is to progress through increasing challenging leagues. <br><br>An assortment of camera angles are supplied to play from. 3 exclusive remixes of Industrial band Gravity Kills make up the soundtrack. Up to four drivers can race against each other.",
