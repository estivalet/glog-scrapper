  "description": "In this 1st-person, point and click adventure game, you play a dog (in a dog's universe) living under the brutal and corrupt regime of a dictator named Chegga.  Chegga has full control of the media and has placed his friends in positions of power.<br><br>Players must collect evidence of Chegga's wrong doing and sell it\nto a shadowy group called C.A.T.S. (Coalition Against Totalitarian Society) which will presumably use the information to wrest control from Chegga.  In selling this information, the goal is also to be gaining enough money to purchase a train ticket, leave this part of the world, and try to make a better life.<br><br>The way the plot is laid out, it is unclear whether the player's character is out to rid the world of a tyrant or simply in it for the money.",
