  "description": "<i>Return Fire</i> is the spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Fire+Power\">Fire Power</a> and it fits in both the strategy and action genres. You can take control of one of 4 vehicles, a jeep, helicopter, tank and a missile launching vehicle (but actually called The Armoured Support Vehicle (ASV).<br><br>There are are two ways to win, the easier one would be to capture the enemy's flag by bringing it to your bunker with the frail Jeep. This is the main objective. The other way to win is to destroy your enemy, a secondary objective.",
