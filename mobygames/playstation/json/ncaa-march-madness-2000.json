  "description": "March Madness 2000 is the third title in EA Sports' college basketball franchise. This time, there are over 200 teams to choose from, including 16 top women's programs. The teams have unique playbooks, play styles and fight songs. Game options include exhibition games and tournaments. The Dynasty mode allows one to lead a team over several seasons, with recruiting and &quot;red-shirting&quot; of players included. &quot;Rivalry Mode&quot; allows the automatic selection of a team's arch-nemesis as the opponent. There are new motion captured moves (including several flashy dunks), and the new &quot;Dynamic Ball Control&quot; feature allows for more precise control of moves like crossovers and spins. The game features commentary by Dick Vitale.",
