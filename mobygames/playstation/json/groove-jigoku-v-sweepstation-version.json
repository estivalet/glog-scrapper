  "description": "<i>Groove Jigoku Five</i> is one part a DJ mixing console and also a collection of mini-games.<br><br>The DJ mixer screen is a music editor where players can listen to music and alter it by changing the beat and applying various effects and sounds. Initially only a portion of sounds is available, and to unlock the rest of them the players need to play the other part of <i>Groove Jigoku Five</i>.<br><br>The other part of the game is a collection of mini-games, or hell part-time jobs. These games are usually short and visually simplistic. On the mini-game selection screen only three random mini-games are available at each time and the players need to play more to unlock more games. They include counting people in traffic, crossing a road collecting mushrooms along the way, chopping logs, racing to the cliff, remembering the right sequence, spotting ghosts, assembling ball pens, and more. For doing these jobs the players get some money, which they can spend at vending machines, which give out random prizes. It can be either sounds for the DJ mixing console, or just random collectible pictures.<br><br>Most of the mini-games were later reused in the PSP game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wtf-work-time-fun\">WTF: work time fun (Baito Hell 2000)</a> practically unchanged or with minor cosmetic iterations. The game's structure, except for the DJ mixing part, was also carried over to <i>WTF: work time fun</i>. ",
