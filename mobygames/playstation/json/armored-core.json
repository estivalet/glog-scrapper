  "description": "You play the role of a Raven mercenary, piloting a powerful Mech called &quot;Armored Core&quot;. You only work for profit, as the money you make goes towards upgrades and repaires to your mech.<br><br>Multi-national companies are lined up at your door, paying you to complete certain objectives, which mainly include the destruction of a certain target or another mech. The more you complete, the better the pay and job offers, therefore allowing you to build the ultimate Armored Core.<br><br>Apart from the single player campaign, you can take on a friend in a multiplayer battle. You each control a mech, and battle it out in a large war area (ranging from huge cities to desert planes).",
