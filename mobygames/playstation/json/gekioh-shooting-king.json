  "description": "<i>Gekioh</i> is an enhanced port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/shienryu\">Shienryu</a>. This release adds the following game modes:\n<ul><li>Pocket Mode: imitates PocketStation graphics, with deliberately primitive visuals consisting of heart-shaped enemies and blocky ships.\n<li>Comical Mode: music and sound effects are replaced by laughter and applause (when the player reaches a high score).\n<li>Stingy Mode: the player has only one life and no continues; only two levels are playable.\n<li>No Mercy Mode: a harder difficulty level.\n<li>Slow Mode: darker graphics and sound effects reminiscent of horror themes (e.g. enemy and player-controlled ships scream when destroyed). All sprites on screen move slower, but the amount of bullets fired by enemies is increased.\n<li>Ancient Mode: the screen has a yellow tinge and displays &quot;cracks&quot;; music is changed to reflect a &quot;retro&quot; setting.</li></ul>",
