  "description": "A radical graphical remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zork-the-great-underground-empire\">Zork: The Great Underground Empire</a> made some 19 years after the series debut on a PDP-10 mainframe at MIT, this version boasts the incorporation of modern gameplay amenities undreamed of the first time around, such as automapping and, er, graphics.<br><br>Given ample time to drift wildly, the story and premise appear to have remained remarkably close to the source material -- the locations, layout and denizens of this fantastical subterranean treasure-hunt familiar to anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the original game.  Where the biggest change lies, of course, is in the transition from the text parser to an interface controllable by a console's joystick.  Adapting some sentence-construction conventions from the graphical adventure game genre (and the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), menus selectable with a joystick pointer fill in for common &quot;action&quot; verbs while icons represent the inventory items the verbs influence; an expanded compass rose permits precise navigation of the Flatheadian ruins. (Alas!  No secret joystick-button combination for &quot;xyzzy&quot;!)<br><br>In short: as faithful a reproduction of the original experience as you're going to find without employing a keyboard or voice-recognition software, plus &quot;modern&quot; graphics, sound and music!",
