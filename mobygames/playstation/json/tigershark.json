  "description": "<i>Tigershark</i> is set in 2060, where a Russian commander is seeking to sink the entire Pacific tectonic plate by constructing geothermal taps in the ocean. Only the Tigershark, a powerful prototype attack subfoil (submarine-hydrofoil) can stop it. The Tigershark will encounter enemy submarines, hostile aircraft, and powerful battle cruisers in battles in both sea and air. Some missions require escorting ally submarines to safety.",
