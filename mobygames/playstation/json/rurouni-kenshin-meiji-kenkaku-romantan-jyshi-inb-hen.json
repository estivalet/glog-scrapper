  "description": "This is an RPG with an alternative plot to the original Rurouni Kenshin series in which the main protagonist isn't Kenshin, but two characters created specially for that game: Hikaru (a young girl) and Hiziri (a young boy), both of them with a lost past, which key resides in the hands of Saitou and Aoshi, respectively. When starting the game you must choose which of the two you want to play with, having into account that according to your selection, the events and the people that will join your group would be different, as well as the main villains.<br><br>The story is quite simple, it focuses in the new Meiji Era after Shishio's saga, once we start playing we get in a fight that we can't win, but Kenshin will appear to save us. Then Kaoru will take us to the Dojo Kamiya, and there the adventure will begin. We must then recruit Kaoru and Yoshi, and start the search of Kenshin. The Meiji government is facing a serious threat and we must reunite 9 seals that will make new zones accessible; for that we must defeat 10 enemies. In that way Kenshin, Sanosuke, Aoshi and Saitou will join us to battle.",
