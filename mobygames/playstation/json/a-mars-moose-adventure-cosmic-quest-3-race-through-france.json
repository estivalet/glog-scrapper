To do so, they travel to the French countryside to collect some souvenirs for her report. Upon arrival, they decide to participate in the &quot;International Bicycle Race,&quot; a reference to the real-life Tour de France. The player navigates Mars' bicycle around other bikers and hazards and along the way visits a farm, a circus, and some mountain trails. At each location, the player has to complete an alphabetizing minigame to acquire a souvenir. After all three souvenirs have been collected, Mars and Starboard can reach the race's finish line and travel back home.<br><br>Part of Lightspan's reading and language arts curriculum, the game is geared toward children and aims to teach alphabetical sorting, memory skills and visual-discrimination skills.",
