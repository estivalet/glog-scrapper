  "description": "Based on the <i>Jingle Cats</i> series of novelty albums, this life simulation game has players making the peace at Jingle Cat House. In each level, the player chooses a few cats to put in a room together and try to build their relationship with each other. Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pac-man-2-the-new-adventures\">Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures</a>, players don't control the cats or even have strong influence over them. Instead, cats have a mind of their own; players interact with different items in the room in the hopes they can coax cats into doing what they want. As cats wander the room, players are able to do many different things: pick cats up, move furniture and props around, bring out toys to play with them. If the players do a good job bringing cats close to each other, at the end of the stage the two cats will form a positive relationship with each other, but if players fail to bring the cats close enough with each other they have to try the stage over again. In between stages, players get an animated performance of one of the Jingle Cats songs.",
