  "description": "One of the earliest in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Konami+Digital+Entertainment%2c+Inc%2e\">Konami's</a> franchise, this version featured 300 actual MLB players at the time, but did not feature the MLB licensed teams.  Players can choose to either play against a friend in <i>Exhibition</i>, <i>Season</i> or </i>Playoffs</i>.  The gameplay is geared for more of a simulation style of play with the players stats determining on how well they hit, pitch and field.<br><br>Along with the standard modes for a baseball game, this one also featured the ability to customize their teams and choose any player to create their &quot;Dream Team&quot;.  It also had a variety of different camera angles to choose from and had meters to show their players progress such as a &quot;Streak Bar&quot; that showed a batters hitting ability and a &quot;Pitching Bar&quot; that showed whether a pitcher was fatigued.",
