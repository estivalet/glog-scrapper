  "description": "University student Amber just thought she was buying a new video game, but everything changes when she discovers her brand new Game Stealth is able to turn her into a superhero. Soon she finds herself fighting petty crime and taking down an evil game company while still making time for classes and anime club.<br><br><i>Manic Game Girl</i> is a comedic action/adventure game with a heavy story focus and a large amount of space to explore. Combat is based around Amber's Game Stealth suit, which she can activate when enemies are nearby. Combat plays like a 3D beat-em-up with relatively simple controls; there are two attack buttons, a punch and a kick, and combos are based on repeatedly tapping attack buttons. She also has a throw when near enemies.",
