  "description": "<i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> is a remake of an earlier game with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/shin-megami-tensei\">same name</a>. The changes mostly involve the visual aspect. The graphics have been updated to match the 2D standard of 32-bit consoles. Interior locations are much more detailed, with visible furniture and other items in rooms that were empty in the original version.<br><br>The most notable change are the 3D dungeons, which can now be navigated with smooth scrolling, unlike the &quot;jumping&quot; navigation of the earlier versions. The remake also has an additional difficulty level, dubbed &quot;normal&quot;; the original difficulty level is called &quot;hard&quot;. The easier difficulty level also reduces the amount of random battles. Story, dialogues, layout of locations, and general gameplay remain unchanged in this version.",
