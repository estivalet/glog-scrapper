  "description": "<i>Dà Fùw?ng Zh? Xiào Xiào Ji?nghú</i> is a digital board game similar to Softstar's popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/richman-2\">Richman</a> series. Set in historical China, players pick one of various different characters who set out to become tycoons monopolizing business in their town. Like a lot of simple economic board games, property management is the goal: as players move around the board game by rolling dice, they automatically buy any vacant squares they land on and pay rent to the owners of any occupied squares they land on. Some squares also have special events which affect the player's fortune.",
