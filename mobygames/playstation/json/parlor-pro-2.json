  "description": "<i>Parlor! Pro 2</i> is the second in a series of pachinko simulator games from Japan.\nPachinko is sometimes referred to as the number one pastime in Japan, and it is played in gaming halls called parlors. Gambling for money is illegal in Japan so players purchase steel balls with which they play the game. At the end of their session they exchange their remaining balls for tokens which, in turn, can be exchanged for goods / prizes. <br><br>This game features two pachinko machines, 'Hana Mizuki' and 'New Road Star', three gaming modes 'Simulator', 'Story', and a third that shows scenes from each game.\n",
