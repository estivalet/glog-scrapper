As the only survivor Lemming that managed to rescue himself from the evil spell\nof Evil Ed, you (Lomax) must stop Evil Ed's distracting effect over the LemmingLand.<br><br>In your quest most of your enemies will be Hench Lemmings which've been possessed\nby Evil Ed's evil spell. You will be mainly using your spin attack or -when grabbed-\nyour magic helmet to free these imprisoned Lemmings from the spell.<br><br>You have also some special abilities like building a bridge, digging horizontally \nthrough certain obstacles (just like the other Lemmings games) or throwing a flaming\nhelmet that will help you to accomplish your goal.",
