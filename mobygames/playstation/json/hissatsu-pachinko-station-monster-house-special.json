  "description": "<i>Hissatsu Pachinko Station Monster House Special</i> is a single player pachinko simulation.<br><br>Pachinko is played in gaming halls called parlors and it is sometimes referred to as the number one pastime in Japan. Gambling for money is illegal in Japan so players purchase steel balls with which they play the game. At the end of their session they exchange their remaining balls for tokens which, in turn, can be exchanged for goods / prizes. \n",
