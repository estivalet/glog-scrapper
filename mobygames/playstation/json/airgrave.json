  "description": "<i>AirGrave</i> is a top-down vertically scrolling shooter controlling a plane. At the start one of four pilots is selected (Aine, Randy, Reny, Vel) each with a different plane and statistics based on air attack, defence, ground attack and mobility. The ship can be moved freely around the screen. Enemies appear in waves both on the ground and in the air. The ship can take multiple hits, shown through a shield meter in the top left corner. Destroyed enemies leave behind power-ups. The plane has access to a special attack for which the meter recharges slowly. Levels generally end with a boss fight. Between missions there are short, animated sequences with voice characters where the story is furthered. When dead, multiple tries are offered through credits system.",
