Players need to catapult themselves across a canyon, camouflage themselves as a bush to sneak past Ralph, lure sheep with sheep perfume etc.<br><br>The player takes on the role as starving Ralph Wolf and must help him steal one sheep from Sam Sheep Dog and get it to a certain goal location. With a wide arsenal of Acme gadgets at his disposal, Ralph is sure to concoct the perfect plan for keeping his stomach filled, or not! The game takes place across 15 various stages as well as 2 hidden stages, each with their own requirements and challenges, so the longevity of the game is notable.<br><br>The puzzles consist of finding items and using them at certain location or on certain characters. Items include lettuce to lure sheep and mines which can be defused. There also are mailboxes with which the player can order a wide arsenal of helpful Acme gadgets. Directly after ordering the product is air shipped instantaneously, with a crate falling from the sky. Gadgets include a rocket, dynamite, elastic band, a fan, a metal detector and many more. Some gadgets are level specific, like for example a time travel gadget with which Ralph can traveling back and forth in time to manipulate placement of rocks and trees.<br><br>There are checkpoints throughout each of the levels, although there are no visual clues as to where they are. For example, if the player reaches a certain area carrying the sheep and then falls off a cliff, the player plus sheep will be respawned near that area. Each level also has a punch clocks, usually in a hidden area, they acts just as an extra collectible.",
