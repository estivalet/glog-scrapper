  "description": "A secret organization called Fata Morgana is developing a weapon that is capable of killing or wounding two-thirds of the world's population. A super-national group of combat experts from all over the world called Project Blue has been established to counteract Fata Morgana's evil doings. <br><br><i>Sonic Wings Special</i> is an enhanced and expanded port of <i>Aero Fighters Special</i> (<i>Sonic Wings Limited</i> in Japan), a coin-op shoot-'em-up with vertical scrolling. The original coin-op game uses altered levels, graphics and many features from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/aero-fighters\">Aero Fighters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/aero-fighters-2\">Aero Fighters 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/aero-fighters-3\">Aero Fighters 3</a>. <br><br>The home console version adds new characters and endings, new bosses, updated graphics and unlockable planes. There are also Time Attack and 2-player modes. The game uses a branching stage system, so it is impossible to see all levels in one sitting. There is a total of 14 playable characters and many different endings (some of which are reused from previous games in the series). Overall the game has a comic feel. <br><br>As of Summer 2012, the Android version of <i>Sonic Wings Special</i> has only 4 playable characters with 4 endings and 9 stages. However, the publisher is planning to add further elements of the original version.",
