  "description": "<i>Dark Tales: From the Lost Soul</i> is a Japanese exclusive horror Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game featuring 3 stories unrelated to each other. The game starts at a bar with strange guests and a creepy senior host who stars telling the stories to the guests.<br><br>The stories are as follows:<ul>\n<li><b>Cat &amp; Mouse:</b> A detective on the trail of a Christmas Eve serial killer is led to an abandoned amusement park, there he must go through all the traps and avoid the killer's sudden attacks to apprehend him.</li>\n<li><b>Ghost Writer:</b> Players take the role of a writer who has a deadline of 5 days to finish a new book. The writer receives a mysterious CD through the mail and after installing it, he starts getting nightmares and if he survives through them and wakes up, he finds a part of the story being written for him.</li>\n<li><b>The Honeymoon:</b> A newlywed couple is being chased by a mysterious driver in a police car. Will they manage to survive and avoid the driver?</li></ul>\nThe game features full motion videos with most games not featuring any people on screen. Gameplay involves making choices on what to use or where to go to at set periods of time, quick-time events where players dodge attacks from their stalkers and traps as well as shooting segments where players try to shoot their enemies with a limited amount of ammo.<br><br>Each story has multiple endings and successive playthroughs or game overs will allow players to skip the videos they've already seen.<br><br>The Honeymoon story has the most endings and after unlocking each ending features flashbacks which give hints to players how to unlock the endings they haven't seen yet.",
