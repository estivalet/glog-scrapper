  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rampage\">Rampage</a> was a simple arcade game. There were three monsters and one goal: Smash stuff. <i>Rampage Through Time</i>, the fourth installment, is played in a similar fashion to the previous games with a few new features. <br><br>As the title implies, <i>Rampage Through Time</i> adds a time-travel element. Your oversized mutants travel to time periods such as the Old West and Medieval times, as well as other, more general  historical periods, like &quot;war zone,&quot; &quot;alien,&quot; and &quot;gangster.&quot; ",
