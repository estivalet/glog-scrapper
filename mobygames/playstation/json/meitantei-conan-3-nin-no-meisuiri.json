  "description": "Written by the same scenario writer who wrote for the animated TV series, this story of Detective Conan brings three sharp-witted characters from the franchise through three separate cases together. Scenario 1 focuses on Ai Haibara, an adult shrank to the size of an elementary school student by the same drug as Conan. Scenario 2 focuses on Heiji Hattori, the great detective from the west who is also aware of Conan's true identity. And scenario 3 focuses on Conan Edogawa, whose real name is Shin'ichi Kudou. All three separate cases have one thing in common, though... the men in black organization who was behind Conan's mysterious transformation. The gameplay is that of a typical visual novel with adventure elements such as searching the scenes for clues, questioning suspects and uncover mysteries during the investigation.",
