  "description": "<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Junior</i> is a quiz game based on the successful TV show for one to four players.\nThe basic rules are still the same: The player takes the role of a candidate and has to answer 15 questions by choosing the correct answer out of four given possibilities. For every right answer they receive money with the amount doubling with each correct answer. There are also the same three help options as in the televised game: 50:50 which eliminates two false answers, asking the studio 'audience' and phoning a friend, in the game the latter is a prerecorded conversion.<br><br>There are four modes of play, the straightforward quiz, Head to Head, a Team game, or the Fastest Finger game with the last three options becoming available only when multiple players are participating. <br><br>In this game there is no animated audience and no animated player characters. The game is played with the mouse but can also be played via the keyboard.",
