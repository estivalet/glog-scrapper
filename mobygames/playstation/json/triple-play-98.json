  "description": "This baseball simulation features official MLB 1997 statistics and names for all teams and players - these can be traded, or new fictitious players can be created. Players have distinct batting and bowling styles.  Over 50 distinct statistics are stored for each of these, with full analysis on offer. You can play in simulation or action modes. Player and team Artificial Intelligence has more complexities than in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/triple-play-97\">the previous Triple Play game</a>. Two-man commentary is provided, for a play-by-play summary as well as 'Color Commentary' to add detail and depth to the analysis.",
