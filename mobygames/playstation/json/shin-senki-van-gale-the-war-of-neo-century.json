  "description": "War has been raging for several years now between the Glomar Empire and the distant space colonies. The Mule Colony Alliance have banded together to fight for independence as a new order called Elysion. The battles in this war are carried out by new fighting robots called Assault Armor, and as a pilot on either the Glomar or Elysion side you will help to decide the outcome of the war.<br><br><i>Van-Gale</i> is a one-on-one 3D space shooter that combines elements of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/omega-boost\">Omega Boost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Virtual+On%3a+Cyber+Troopers\">Virtual On</a>. You and an opponent trade fire and blows in a free-scrolling environment. Each pilot's machine has different abilities: some have high speed, some have powerful or highly-accurate weaponry, and some simply excel at punching other machines. To win, the opponent's HP gauge must be depleted in any way possible. The game includes eight playable characters, and both a story mode and a split-screen versus mode.",
