  "description": "<i>Chocobo Stallion</i> is a game in Square's long running Chocobo series. The game is a spin-off of sorts of the minigame found in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Final+Fantasy+VII\">Final Fantasy VII</a> where the aim is to breed chocobos and compete with them in various races. This game, as opposed to the minigame, is much more complex and in depth with various statistics screens, racing schedules and more. The player starts out with one chocobo on a ranch, but as the game progresses more will be added to the stable.<br><br>The game features a story including characters from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Chocobo%27s+Dungeon\">Chocobo's Dungeon</a> games, and uses similar chibi style graphics.",
