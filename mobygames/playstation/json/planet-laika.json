  "description": "<i>Planet Laika</i> is a role-playing game where the player controls the titular character, Laika, who is part of an expedition to Mars, in order to discover the truth about rumors that have been going around, concerning the end of the world and the existence of a certain supernatural creature.<br><br>Laika has multiple-personality disorder, and when talking to other characters, the player will see an aura around them in one of three colors, each of which is associated with a personality type: yellow, for those who wish to attain physical beauty; red for people who are strong and violent; and finally blue, who are psychotic but very crafty individuals.<br><br>Laika can absorb these auras, and therefore take on different personalities. This happens by filling up a gauge each time the player absorbs one of the auras, and allowing transformation into one of the three types by visiting a mirror.\nThe game then uses these transformations to solve puzzles throughout, such as having Laika become “red” in order to lift heavy objects.<br><br>The battle system is somewhat akin to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pong\">Pong</a>, in that the player has to deflect enemy projectiles in order inflict damage himself, by using something called a Mind Core.\nBattles only occur when Laika is transformed into one of the alter egos.<br><br>Like many RPGs of its day, <i>Planet Laika</i> uses 3D polygonal characters with 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, along with CG cutscenes.",
