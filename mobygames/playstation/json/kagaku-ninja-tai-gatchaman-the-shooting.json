You select any of the four characters featured in the game (Ken the Eagle, Joe the Condor, Jun the Swan and Jinpei the Swallow) and shoot your way through 4 action filled stages with increasing difficulty either running riding a vehicle or flying, to in the end defeat the evil Berg Katse. Along the way you can collect power-ups for your weapons to increase your chances of survival.",
