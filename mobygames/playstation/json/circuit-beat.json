  "description": "<i>Circuit Beat</i> is an arcade racing game developed by Prism Arts which plays similarly to Namco's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Ridge+Racer\">Ridge Racer</a>. The game has three game modes: Race, where the player races against four computer opponents in a four lap race; Battle, which is the same as Race but the computer opponents are replaced with replays of other human player's races that are saved to the memory card; and Time Trial, where the player must try to get the fastest lap time they can. Like with other arcade racers of the time, the game has a timer which counts down during a race and is replenished by passing checkpoints throughout each circuit. The game features a total of three different racing circuits and a selection of unlicensed vehicles to race with.",
