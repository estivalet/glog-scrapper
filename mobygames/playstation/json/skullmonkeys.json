  "description": "<em>Skullmonkeys</em> is the successor title to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/neverhood\">The Neverhood</a>, which came out only on PC (and, in Japan, as &quot;<em>Klaymen Klaymen</em>&quot; on PSX). The game is an old-school jump and run type of game, with a large number of FMVs. The entire game is molded in clay.<br><br>The player takes control of Klaymen throughout the game in an attempt to put a stop to the main opponent, being Klogg, who wants to destroy Klaymen's homeworld, The Neverhood, via a huge robot called &quot;Evil Engine No. 9&quot;. He uses an army of extremely dumb skullmonkeys to stop Klaymen in his quest; With the exception of several strange, clay birds, each and every enemy in the game is a monkey. The game features music with lyrics by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,27613/\">Terry Scott Taylor</a>.",
