  "description": "<i>Soukyugurentai</i> is a top-down shooter using an elaborate combination of pre-rendered and real-time 3D graphics as well as 2D pixel art.<br>\nThe player is given a choice to control one of the three fighter ships of the JIN-SET Corporation Self-Defense Corps, all with strangely fish-themed names - S.O.Q. 004 Swordfish, S.O.Q. 010 Mackerel,and S.O.Q. 025 Scallop. Each ship comes with a unique, upgradable weapon system - Swordfish uses an all-around average rapid fire gun, Mackerel fires a weak laser and homing missiles, while Scallop obliterates foes with a narrowly-focused rail gun and a sub-cannon that fires in a direction opposite to the ship's motion. In addition to the primary weapons each ship carries a lock-on laser, activated by holding down the fire button.",
