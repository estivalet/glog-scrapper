  "description": "This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter is similar gameplay-wise to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Sega\">Sega's</a> arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zaxxon\">Zaxxon</a>. The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment.  The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.<br><br>Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element.  Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit.  To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups.  In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems.  This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships. ",
