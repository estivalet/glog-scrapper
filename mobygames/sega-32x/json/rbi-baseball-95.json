  "description": "This version is an updated follow-up to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=R%2eB%2eI%2e+Baseball+series\">R.B.I. series</a>. Many of the same features from other baseball games are present and there are three different game modes to choose from: exhibition, playoff, and home run derby. What makes this version different from the others is a lack of MLB license, though it does feature a MLBPA license with top players of the time such as Roger Clemens, Otis Nixon, and Bobby Larkin among many others.<br><br>Though it doesn't have a full MLB license, it tries to recreate the MLB experience by omitting the teams nicknames but using similar team colors and using the actual stadiums without using their distinctive trademarks. It doesn't feature a battery back-up, but does have a password feature for a player to pick up and play later if they choose.",
