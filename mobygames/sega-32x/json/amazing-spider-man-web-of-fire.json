  "description": "An electric plasma grid has left New York in a state of chaos, and only Spider-Man can save the city from total destruction. Responsible is the terrorist organisation HYDRA, which also sent out machines (similar to Gargoyles) into the city.<br><br>The game features side-scrolling action in which Spider-Man has to take on various enemy types which want to kill him. Besides the usual range of melee kicks and punches, he also sticks to walls and uses special attacks based on his web fluid. Creating spider web &quot;vines&quot; are used to swing from building to building; either required to cross gaps or simply to progress faster in the levels. Every use of his fluid decreases a  web bar which, just like health, is refilled by picking up items floating in the game world. The first goal of the game is to rescue the superhero Daredevil, who then continues to help Spider-Man out: after activating the associated special attack, Daredevil covers the screen with his attacks.",
