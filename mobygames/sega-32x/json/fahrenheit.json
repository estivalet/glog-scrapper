  "description": "<em>Fahrenheit</em> is an interactive movie that puts players into the flame-resistant suit of a firefighter. You are the new guy in the firehouse.  Last week, you saved three lives. But now, you're on a new squad, and have to prove yourself to them.<br><br>Like most interactive movies, <em>Fahrenheit</em> is played entirely while watching a digitized video. At certain critical points in the video, players must press certain directions on the control pad or action buttons in order to progress in the game. <em>Fahrenheit</em> takes this a step further by providing several buildings in which the player has the ability to move from room to room in in a non-linear fashion. As players move from room to room, they have to locate victims and neutralize fire hazards.",
