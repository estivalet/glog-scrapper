Little ghosts gone mad. Now they're waiting to make a trip through your mind. Without the basic directions. (Like left &amp; right &amp; up &amp; down!)<br><br>On their journey, Gleebs will battle their lizard foes with buckets of water. They'll climb endless stairs endlessly. Defying physics, they'll join and part. All with one goal in mind: to pass through mirrors from one world to the other. Don't ask why. It's more fun just to share their crazy world for a while.<br><br>You'll see that sinister lizard turn into a fish into a bird. Then into an egg (if you're good.) But you may not believe your eyes when you see it. Because that's what illusions are about. Right? Left? Maybe?",
