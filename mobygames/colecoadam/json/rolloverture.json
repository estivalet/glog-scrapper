  "description": "<h3>Back of Box - ColecoVision (US) (from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rolloverture/adblurbs\">Ad Blurbs</a>)</h3>The hall is at a hush. The maestro takes the baton and readies the orchestra. <b>But wait!</b> All the notes have been scrambled and you must help the maestro scurry madly around the orchestra pit directing the notes back to their proper order. <b><i>Climb ladders, throw levers, reverse the conveyor belt,</b></i> and <b><i>step on rollovers</b></i> to guide the music ball to the correct notemaker slot. Proper placement rewards you with the overture, but incorrect placement results in a speed increase and greater difficulty. A variety of melodies and random scrambling of the notes guarantees to keep your interest, while you painlessly learn about music.",
