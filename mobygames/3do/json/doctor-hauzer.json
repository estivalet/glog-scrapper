  "description": "This is an early 3D survival horror game that involves surviving traps in a sentient house and solving puzzles rather than fighting enemies.  Like the best horror movies, it uses sound effects such as echoing footsteps and creepy changing music to increase the scary atmosphere.  <br><br>It takes place in 1952, where you play as an investigator searching for the archeologist Dr. Hauzer who has disappeared.  He built his house over an archeologist site and became obsessed with the deity Kellbim to whom he sacrifices his interns.  You will die numerous times in the house's deadly traps but you have unlimited save games so you can viewing the death animations is part of the fun.  You can switch the view between first-person, third-person or overhead.  Choosing a different view will help you overcome some traps.",
