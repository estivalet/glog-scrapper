  "description": "Another live-actor arcade shooter by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=American+Laser+Games%2c+Inc%2e\">American Laser Games</a> (makers of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mad-dog-mccree\">Mad Dog McCree</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/crime-patrol\">Crime Patrol</a>), <i>Who Shot Johnny Rock?</i> is set in the classic 1920's style gangster era. <br><br>As the title suggests, you're supposed to find out who shot singer Johnny Rock (or at least who hired the guys who shot him) and put them behind bars.<br><br>There are some differences between this game and previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=American+Laser+Games%2c+Inc%2e\">American Laser Games</a> shooters. Instead of a wimpy pistol, you get a tommy gun (which doesn't need to be reloaded). Unfortunately, you also have limited ammo and need to buy more at times. Instead of lives you have a fixed supply of money, and each time you die you lose some cash. Lose it all and it's game over.",
