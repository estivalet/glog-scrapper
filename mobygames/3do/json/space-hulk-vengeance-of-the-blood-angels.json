  "description": "<i>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels</i> is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the\nWarhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop table top games. \nIt is the successor of the PC game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Hulk\">Space Hulk</a> from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the Terminators of the Blood Angels Chapter of Space Marines and the Tyranid Genestealers.<br><br>You control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Genestealers just as in a First-Person-Shooter. So the game includes tactical planning and fighting in a good balance.",
