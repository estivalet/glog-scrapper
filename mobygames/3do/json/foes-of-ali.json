Fatigue is not simulated, but players can slow down their opponents after a series of large successful hits along with bruises, blooded and black eyes.<br><br>There are 21 different camera views to choose from, including first-person that will react to their fighters being hit (ex. if a player keeps getting hit in the eyes, the screen will start to blacken, simulating a swollen eye and if they take a hard enough punch they will actually see the game through double vision).  Championship photos of each boxer is also show before a fight and commentary is provided by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,341901/\">Tim Gammon</a>.",
