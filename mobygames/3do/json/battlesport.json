  "description": "<i>Battlesport</i> simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.<br><br>Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals. <br><br>Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.",
