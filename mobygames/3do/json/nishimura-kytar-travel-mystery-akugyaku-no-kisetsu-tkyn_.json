  "description": "Late at night in the mid of July, a jogging man was found dead, crossbow bolt piercing his heart and a couple of photos of a swimsuit model in his death grip. You play a chief inspector Totsukawa, a fictional detective created by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,512827/\">Kyoutarou Nishimura</a> (?? ???), a Japanese writer of a mystery novels. The victim appears to be living in a nearby apartment, and after checking the crime scenes and gathering clues, talking to witnesses and person who found the body would be the next logical step.<br><br>Unlike the PSP version release 15 years later, this game uses live-action during both cut-scenes and in-game investigation while gameplay relies of icons which let you listen to what others have to say, talk to witnesses and suspects, and investigate the crime scenes. At the beginning of each day you start with a meeting to discuss what you've uncovered thus far with your subordinates and decide what to do and where to go next. Each day progresses as you move from location to location, leaving you with limited number of locations you can visit before the day ends, so following clues and figuring out where is the best thing to go next is of utmost importance in order to solve the crime.",
