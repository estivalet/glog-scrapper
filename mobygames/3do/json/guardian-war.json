  "description": "In a classic Japanese RPG style, <i>Guardian War</i> pits you as guardian golem against the dark forces of Azrael, the Evil Lord.  Your world is infested with monsters and your job is to destroy them.  Along the way you meet other golems that you need to revive so that they can join your quest.  Your ultimate goal is to defeat Azrael.<br><br>RPG elements are fairly standard with hit points, magic points, speed, mobility, skills, etc.  Each golem type has specific abilities, for example Priest is strong in Light Magic whereas Archer is strong in arrow attacks.  General movement is done on the World map which is divided into Fields and player is able to see which Fields are occupied by the enemy.  Shops are only accessible on the World map.  Selecting a Field takes the group of golems into a Field map which is presented in pseudo-3D.<br><br>Player can freely travel the Field map, finding treasures and other items, periodically bumping into enemy groups.  Battles are fought in turns on the same map, there is no separate battle screen.  Movement is into main compass directions only and the player controls the whole group when travelling.  Only during battle are each group member individually controllable.",
