War hero Colonel Christopher Blair is transferred to the old carrier Victory. Take the role of Blair and ensure the success of the Confederation's last-ditch attempt for victory: the destruction of the Kilrathi homeworld.<br><br><i>Wing Commander III</i> has the usual mix of space battles and cinematic storytelling.
