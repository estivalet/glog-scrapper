  "description": "Sometime in the near future, the United States has come under attack by a mysterious threat.  After New York and Los Angeles are destroyed, many Americans have formed an underground resistance to fight off the attackers using a VR Simulator to control their planes to keep their fighters alive.  The player has been recruited and is codenamed &quot;Stalker&quot; to defend the U.S. and bring back peace and order.<br><br>There are 15 missions in all, where the player has to complete certain objectives, such as destroy a certain amount of enemies or defend certain targets.  The planes are mostly modern age such as the A-10 Warthog. The player can choose to use either the plane's machine guns or missiles to bring down enemy targets.",
