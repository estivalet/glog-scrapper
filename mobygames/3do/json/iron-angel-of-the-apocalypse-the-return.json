  "description": "Tetsujin returns in this sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/iron-angel-of-the-apocalypse\">Iron Angel of the Apocalypse</a>. The story picks up shortly after the events of the previous game.  After his showdown with the Scientist and the Android, Tetsujin finds himself disembodied. A mysterious corporation known as SCR gives you a new body, but their plans for your are mysterious.<br><br>The format of this game is mostly similar to the first. This is a first person shooter that relies heavily on video cutscenes to tell a story. The graphics engine has been improved greatly, giving this game a much faster pace than it's predecessor. Whereas the original used a combination of live actors and CG, this one uses CG to depict the humans as well.",
