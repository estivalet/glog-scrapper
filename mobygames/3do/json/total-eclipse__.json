The player controls an aircraft called a FireWing through 20 missions with a perspective behind the craft where the player can manuever the ship up and down, left and right and the gameplay angled towards an on-rail shooter.  Additionally, there are three different levels of power for each weapon that their craft can wield.<br><br>The game is in the style of 3D textured mapping with the story is told through pre-rendered cut-scenes.  The PlayStation version is essentially the same except for sped up gameplay and a password feature that allows the player to pick up and play at their choosing.",
