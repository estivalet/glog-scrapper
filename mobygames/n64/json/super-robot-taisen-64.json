  "description": "The basic concept remains unchanged in this N64 installment of the series - it's a turned based strategy game where the player commands robots and pilots from various Japanese shows, for example Dancouga and different Gundam series, as well as Banpresto originals. Newly introduced are Six God Combination Godmars, Giant Robo and Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team.<br><br>At the beginning of the game, the player is offered a choice out of four pairs of protagonists/rivals, which affects the plot and the stages played. With the different variations included, there are over 100 missions.<br><br>During the stages, the player moves his units over a map, attacking enemies and using special abilities. When getting attacked, player units may defend, counter, or attempt to evade, resulting in no damage at all if successful. Destroyed enemies give experience and money for upgrading between the missions. Often, scripted events happen, such as reinforcements arriving. Sometimes it's also possible to persuade certain characters to join the player's side, in addition to those that join automatically. Certain, otherwise unobtainable units, can also be unlocked by using the N64 Transfer Pak in combination with the Gameboy Color game <i>Super Robot Wars: Link Battler</i>.",
