  "description": "<em>Paperboy</em> returns in this game with the same objectives as last time but with a new retro-3D look. As the paperboy the player must deliver a newspaper to each of their subscribers. The more papers the player delivers in the least amount of time, the better the chances of signing more subscribers. For each street, the player has a maximum number of subscribers that they need to sign-up before they can move onto the next, more challenging street (aka, the next level).<br><br>Each street includes objects that will get in the player's way (such as dogs, fire hydrants, etc.) as well as bonus objectives. Collecting three coins by knocking down people and items on the street will take the player to bonus levels, for instance, ranging from obstacle courses to catching fire flies. The player can win extra subscribers by completing these bonus levels.",
