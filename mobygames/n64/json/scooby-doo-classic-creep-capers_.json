  "description": "Join Scooby and the gang in the hunt for clues to solve some of their greatest mysteries, against some of their more weirder and deadlier foes. All the cast are here, as you control Shaggy through dangerous environments. Escape the puzzles unscathed by collecting clues and trap pieces while avoiding numerous creatures out to scare you. If they do manage to freak out Shaggy and Scooby, you'll drop courage points. Drop too many and you'll run away back to your previous save point, but you can regain courage points by finding Scooby Snacks, or the nearest kitchen to make a well earned sandwich if you're running low.<br><br>Once you discover all the clues to the perfect crime, you must lure the bad guy back to the rest of the Scooby Gang to solve the mystery and put evil in its place.",
