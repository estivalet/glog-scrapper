  "description": "<i>Sesame Street: Elmo's Letter Adventure</i> is an educational game for preschooler kids. Characters from Sesame Street help young children to learn the alphabet through a series of mini games. Players are given spoken instructions about every mini game by Sesame Street characters. The player controls Elmo in several mini games, ranging from scuba diving to vehicle driving, with the objective of collecting assigned letters in each level. Each time the player collects a letter, this letter will be uttered by a character, helping children to associate the written form of each letter to its spoken form. Players are encouraged to explore different settings, from outer space to underwater worlds.",
