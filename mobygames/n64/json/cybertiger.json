  "description": "A step back from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tiger+Woods+PGA+series\">Tiger Woods PGA</a>'s simulation style, <i>Cyber Tiger Woods</i> has more of an arcade feel to it, with cartoony-style animations, fast gameplay and elements added to make the game of golf more lively than the real-life counterpart.<br><br>Although realistic elements are there, including full motion capture of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,81971/\">Tiger Woods</a> himself, recreations of five PGA tour courses, and the full range of moves (putting, chipping, driving, etc.), arcade elements —such as 2-player battle mode, zany characters including Little Tiger, and game modes that have you aiming to knock down the opposing character from his platform above a pool of lava turn— are central to gameplay.<br><br>Game modes include a full practise range, skins tournaments and stroke play. Plus there are hidden characters to unlock, equipment upgrades and power-ups, as well as trick shots you just won't see on the PGA tour.",
