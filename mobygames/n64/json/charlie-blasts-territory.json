  "description": "Charlie Blast is a construction worker, but quite different than his more famous colleague. Charlie has a convincing beer belly, he has trouble keeping his jeans up (yup, you will get a nice view of his crack quite frequently) and his chest hair make David Hasselhoff feel ashamed about himself. He is not trying to save a princess either; his mission is to blow islands up with TNT!<br><br>With 3D graphics and some platform elements, <i>Charlie Blast's Territory</i>, a remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Kablooey\">Kablooey</a>, is a modernization of one of the classic puzzle genres where your goal is to push crates into the correct spots. <br><br>Every level is an island. On every island you have at least one bomb and one TNT box. Your goal is to push all of them next to each others and then blow everything up in a huge chain reaction. When you do that, you advance by a level. You cannot pull the crates but you can climb over them.",
