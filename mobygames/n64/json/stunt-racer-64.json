  "description": "This futuristic racer has you flying along specially built tracks, jumping through rings, pulling off aerial stunts and getting up to insane speeds.<br><br>The main aim of the game, as with all racers, is to get to the finish line first. But by getting some air and landing through rings, or pulling off stunts, you'll also pick up coins that will go towards upgrading your car.<br><br>The cars themselves are a mix of the future and the past, with a hot rod style outside with a powerful new age engine inside. That power will go towards getting you over the line, with the use of speed boosts as well as shortcuts on the tracks helping you greatly.<br><br>A 4 player split screen mode is also included, while you can compete in practice, quick race and the competitive League mode, as well as stunt modes that will test your stunt making skills on half pipes and large open tracks.
