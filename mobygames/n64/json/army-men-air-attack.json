  "description": "Much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/army-men-air-tactics\">Army Men: Air Tactics</a>, except in full 3D. You must pick up any lost Army Men, or shoot down enemy helicopters and ground forces to allow you fellow troops to push forward.<br><br>You start with the Huey, with the Chinook, the Super Stallion, and the Apache opening up in later levels. You can also fight it out with a friend in a multiplayer mode, or you can join forces in a co-op mode, and save you fellow troops together.",
