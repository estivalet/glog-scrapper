  "description": "Goemon and his pals take a break from fighting evil and instead get together and play a unique board game against each other for kicks.<br><br><i>Mononoke Sugoroku</i> is a competitive card-fighting / puzzle game in which you try to get your selected character to the end of the board and/or defeat the other players. You start the game with a set of monster cards and select where to place them on the board and later on, depending on the moves the characters make on the board, you get to pit your cards against the other character's cards with the outcome determined by their stats. Your characters have a finite health, and depending on the outcome of the battles you may get to add monster cards to your collection, lose positions in the board, or simply die.<br><br>Additionally you can link up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ganbare-goemon-mononoke-dch-tobidase-nabe-bugy\">Ganbare Goemon: Mononoke D?ch?
