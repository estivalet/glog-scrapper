It allows players to edit photos and add Mario-themed artwork, borders, etc. The game has a specialized cartridge: there are two slots on the top that allow players to insert SmartMedia cards from their cameras. This is for importing digital images for the purpose of editing. It is the only game to use this type of cartridge. Special video game-themed SmartMedia cards were also released for use with the game. There is also a minigame included in the form of a slide puzzle.",
