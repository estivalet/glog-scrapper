  "description": "<i>In-Fisherman Bass Hunter 64</i> is a bass fishing simulation game for the Nintendo 64. The game offers three playing modes: fish for fun, championship, and Custom Tournament. The first lets you choose a lake and fish there at your leisure. The second adds a competitive element. You pick one of two characters and participate in contests, where you have to catch a certain number of bass within a time limit. You start with simple gear, but every time you end up in the top 3 you gain points with which you can upgrade your gear (rods, boats, bait).",
