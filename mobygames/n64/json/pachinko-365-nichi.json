  "description": "The 2nd Pachinko game on N64, also uses 5 recreated real machines from Pachinko company Heiwa (Peace Corporation). It has 3 modes: Battle Simulation where players play 365 days a year starting January 1st trying to earn as much money as possible, Pachinko Research mode where players can play freely while measuring machine configurations, stats over playtime, and individually adjust the tightness of each pin, and battle mode where 2 players (or 1 vs a cpu) try to get the most balls within the time limit on a old fashioned less graphically taxing machine.",
