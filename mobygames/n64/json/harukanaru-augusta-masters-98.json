  "description": "Japan-only T&amp;E SOFT golf game for N64. Once again featuring the August golf course, but this time with a full 3D dynamic camera. As with all golf games from T&amp;E it plays a very good game of golf, though the menu interface is not as straightforward as other games in the series. The engine was later used for one additional golf game on N64.",
