  "description": "The licensed game of the 1998 Football World Cup held in France from June 10 to July 12 and the first World Cup licensed game distributed and developed by Electronic Arts features a tweaked <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=FIFA+98%3a+Road+to+World+Cup\">FIFA 98</a> engine, with all 10 stadiums accurately designed and all 32 teams (plus 8 teams that failed to qualify but still deemed too important to leave out) featuring   real names and close &quot;look-a-like&quot; kits. Changes done to the 3D engine feature include on the fly in-game management with better player positioning AI (including the goalkeeper), and faster gameplay. An editor to change all player information is included, which affects simulated data: the team with higher ratings has a better chance of progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China.<br><br>It's possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw,  randomize or customize them to the players' likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the first of the <i>Classics</i> matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition's history which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice penalty shootouts close the modes available.",
