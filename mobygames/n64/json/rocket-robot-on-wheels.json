  "description": "Whoopy World was finished.  The high-tech theme-park would be opening tomorrow.  How much Rocket, the maintenance robot, wanted to go and see it he could not even tell, but the professor barely noticed.  Then it happened.  Jojo the raccoon, sick of playing second banana to the insipid Whoopy the walrus, stole all of the tokens, tickets, and Whoopy.  There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go and stop Jojo alone.<br><br><i>Rocket: Robot on Wheels</i> is a 3D platformer like no other.  It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in unscripted, realtime physics.  As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting (suddenly a dirty word) tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again.  The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose.  In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game.  The realtime physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.",
