  "description": "This platformer with a <i>Blues Brothers</i> theme loosely follows the plot of the film. You have to escape the prison and get the band back together in order to participate to the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; competition.<br><br>You can accomplish that by jumping over obstacles, beating a lot of people and collecting coins, notes, wrenches, keys and what not in four levels: Prison, Chicago, Graveyard &amp; Swamp. After each level you will free one member of the band. Additionally, the game designers threw in some rhythm-based action: sometimes you have to press the right buttons at the right time in order to proceed. The game features multiplayer, but you only get to play the rhythm mini-game.",
