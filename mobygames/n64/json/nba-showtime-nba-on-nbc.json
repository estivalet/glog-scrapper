  "description": "<i>NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC</i> is a descendant of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=NBA+Jam\">NBA Jam</a>, and is created by some of the key team members. The game follows in the footsteps of NFL Blitz, featuring the option to save personal records and a cheat code system operated by pressing a sequence of buttons. It also features unlock-able characters, including NBA team mascots, and the &quot;On-Fire&quot; option that defines <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Midway\">Midway</a>'s sports games. Players are able to perform special moves such as the alley-oop, the spin move, and the double dunk.  The game also features a Create-a-Player mode that allows custom players to have tweaked abilities by winning matches.<br><br>NBA Showtime debuted as an arcade game featuring rosters from the 1998-99 NBA season as well as secret characters based on the Universal Monsters. The later home console ports of the game use updated rosters for the 1999-2000 season and lacks the Universal Monsters characters. An arcade update was released in 2000 with refreshed rosters as <i>NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC - Gold Edition</i>.",
