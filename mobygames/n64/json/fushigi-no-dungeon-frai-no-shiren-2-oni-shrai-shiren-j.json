  "description": "<i>Fushigi no Dungeon: F?rai no Shiren 2: Oni Sh?rai! Shiren-j?!</i> is the second game in the Shiren the Wanderer series which is part of Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon series, and its only appearance on the Nintendo 64 platform.<br><br>The game is a traditional Roguelike game where you navigate through randomized maps to slay monsters, collect experience and items to accomplish certain tasks. When you die you can retain one item while experience is lost, there might however be ways to increase the number of items retained. You move in a turn-based grid like way where faster enemies are symbolized by getting multiple moves by turn, rather than actually faster movement.<br><br>Set before the events of the first game, Shiren and his weasel Kappa, on the way to the mountains, passes by the village of Natane, where they stop to eat. While eating a tribe of Demons attack. Pushing back against the attack Shiren decides to build a castle to defend the villagers from further attacks. The game revolves around building Castle Shiren. To do this you must seek out rare materials through the multiple dungeons that make up the game. Any progress to this meta goal is saved and progress is not redacted if you die on a run. Certain events trigger monsters to attack the village which you must help defend.<br><br>The game was originally planned to be a N64DD title, but development was later moved to the base N64.",
