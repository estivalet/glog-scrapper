  "description": "<i>Madden Football 64</i> is the first in Electronic Arts' Madden series to appear on the Nintendo 64. In terms of features, it is based closely on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/madden-nfl-98_\">PlayStation/Saturn version of Madden 98</a> (with the same playing modes and even menus) but there are two important differences: The N64 version does not have an NFL license, so there are generic team names without logos (there is an NFLPA license for real player names), and it is the first game in the series to feature fully polygonal graphics, for both stadiums and players.<br><br>Consequently, <i>Madden 64</i> was the most graphically advanced Madden game at the time of release. Visual features include 5000 frames of animation and a first-person HelmetCam view. AI adjusts during the game to the player's style. Creating, drafting and trading a full roster of players is possible.",
