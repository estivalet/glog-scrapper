  "description": "<i>Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue</i> is one of several different games based on the 2000 incarnation of the franchise. This time, the Power Rangers are recruited to protect the city of Mariner Bay against the evil Diabolico and his minions.<br><br>The game's main story mode is called Titanium Quest and consists of three episodes that have to be taken on in order, each consisting of a number of missions, for over 30 missions in total. The missions are of one of four different types.<br><br>The Ranger levels are seen from an angled top-down perspective. A pre-determined Ranger is tasked with either rescuing a number of innocents or removing dangerous obstacles within a time limit. A radar map shows the way to the next objective. Enemy goons that stand in the way can be taken out by shooting an energy burst. Power-ups can be collected that enable more powerful shots, short-time invisibility or enhanced armor, health upgrades and more. Occasionally, the Ranger levels feature boss fights against more powerful enemies.<br><br>The driving levels are seen from the side. A Ranger-controlled vehicle drives from left to right and must put out fires, rescue civilians or clean up radioactive spills while avoiding traffic and shooting at enemy vehicles. There is a time limit and power-ups can be collected to restore health lost through attacks or crashes.<br><br>The Megazord levels are one-on-one battles that pit the Ranger's Megazord mech against one powerful boss enemy. Perspective can be switched between first- and third-person. The goal is to destroy the enemy with missiles or, if close enough, with melee attacks. Blocking is possible and power-ups can be picked up to restore health or increase firepower.<br><br>The final type of level are flying levels in which players control the Green Ranger's hovercraft. In these, the goal is once more to rescue innocents or alternatively, collect a number of items. The hovercraft is seen from behind and can freely move through a 3D environment. As in the Ranger levels, there is a radar map that shows the way to the next objective and a time limit.<br><br>A two-player mode is also available, which consists of a split-screen variant of the Megazord battles. Characters to use in this mode must be unlocked by progressing in the single-player game.<br><br>Comic-style illustrations advance the storyline between levels.",
