  "description": "<i>Bakush? Jinsei 64: Mezase! Resort ?</i> is a board game based on the Japanese board game <i>Jinsei Game</i>. It is an adaption of the Western <i>Game of Life</i>, but the game has more similarities to <i>Monopoly</i>.<br><br>It is primarily aimed at multiple players and focuses on the financial success of the participants. After choosing one of the playing boards, the players throw their dices in turns. Then the player moves forward on the board by a distance depending on the result of the dice throw. Each field represents a business or lot which can be bought if the player has enough money at hand. If another player lands on the same field, a rent has to be payed up. This all influences the stock value of the player's company.",
