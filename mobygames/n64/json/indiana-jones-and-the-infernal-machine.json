  "description": "The year is 1947. Dr. Jones Jr is on a retirement from adventuring, living the life of a scholar and an archaeologist. But soon he meets his old flame ...and new enemies. Soviets are tracking parts of a mysterious, powerful machine from ancient Babylon, hoping to use it as a weapon. They must be stopped from unleashing unspeakable danger from another world.<br><br>Are you ready to lead Indy into adventures in lost temples, under mountains and through unexplored mines, for tales of missing artifacts, snake encounters and other things?<br><br><i>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine</i> combined action and adventure in a way the older Indy games did not do. The gameplay is inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tomb+Raider\">Tomb Raider</a>, as Indy moves through 3D representations of 17 locations around the world. The game engine is modified from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/jedi-knight\">Jedi Knight</a>.<br><br>Puzzles based around switches &amp; items; precise jumping must be negotiated on regular basis. You must use ladders, ropes and dinghies as well as moving on foot. You will also find yourself aboard a jeep and a mine cart. Replacements for your standard whip can be collected en route (from Soviet army arsenal), including grenades, sub-machine guns and bazookas. The valuable treasures you find can be used to buy extra ammo (between the levels). After each level you get your score (Indy Quotient) - you must reach all the treasure items cleverly hidden in secret places to get all the points.",
