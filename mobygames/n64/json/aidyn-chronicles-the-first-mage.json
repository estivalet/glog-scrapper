  "description": "<i>Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage</i> follows the story of Alaron, poisoned by mysterious goblins while out on patrol in the grounds of King Loyd's kingdom. Without an ordinary cure for his illness, Alaron must set out on a journey with a selection of companions in search of the antidote. Little does Alaron know that the journey is even more dangerous then firstly thought, with a mysterious evil force brewing in the distance.<br><br>In this 3D fantasy role-playing game, you must complete a set of quests, through the use of items and magic, while following a slightly non-linear storyline, choosing the order in what to embark tasks on. The game features two distinctive different modes: exploring and fighting. Alaron explores the game world freely, discovers special places and talks to the inhabitants. There are no random encounters but if he meets an enemy the game switches to the combat screen. Combat is basically turn-based but not in the way common in console RPGs: during a character's turn he can be moved in real-time in a circular way — the characters move constantly towards each other. When two rings intersect the characters can launch a regular or magic attack. The party selection (up to four characters) is pre-defined by the story.",
