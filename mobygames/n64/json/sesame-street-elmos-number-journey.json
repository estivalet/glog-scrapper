  "description": "<i>Sesame Street: Elmo's Number Journey</i> is an educational game for preschoolers aged three to six. Players control Elmo as he takes part in activities that involve number recognition and basic math skills. The game's difficulty can be adjusted with three skill levels. Elmo can walk around Sesame Street in a 3D environment and talk to characters such as Big Bird, Count, Cookie Monster and Ernie to see what they are doing while there is a parade going on.<br><br>For the Count you need to walk around in the castle garden's linear maze or the castle itself and pick out a specific number as provided by him, or a group such as bats with that number. The bottom of the screen shows how many numbers there are left to be found. At the courtyard addition is practised by picking up and throwing the requirement number of balls to solve exercises. For Ernie the mechanics are identical, but the environment is the carnival and there is a section involving bumper cars. For Cookie Monster the concept is identical as well, but using a jet ski and snowboarding. It can also be practised in Elmo's playroom.<br><br>The characters are voiced by the same actors as in the TV series.",
