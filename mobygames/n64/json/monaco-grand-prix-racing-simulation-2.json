  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/f1-racing-simulation\">F1 Racing Simulation</a> recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided.<br><br>Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/grand-prix-ii\">Grand Prix 2</a>, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks. ",
