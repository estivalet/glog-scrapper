  "description": "<i>64 ?zum?</i> is a sumo wrestling game. As in the original sport, goal of the relatively short matches (measured in seconds) is to push the opponent out of the fighting area. The game uses 3D areas, the analogue stick for movement and C-button combinations to perform moves. Besides exhibition matches and various tournaments there also is a career mode which features decisions and minigames between matches, which influence the sumo wrestler's statistics, for example choosing the diet or fishing. The game uses a comic look and some of the eight areas feature unusual places such as the Moon or Egypt. ",
