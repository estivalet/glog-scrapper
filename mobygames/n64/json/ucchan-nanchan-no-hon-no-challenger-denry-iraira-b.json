  "description": "<i>Ucchan Nanchan no Hon? no Challenge: Denry? IraIra B?</i> follows the same playing principle as the mechanical wire loop game. In this variant, the player has to guide a ball through six courses which basically consist of narrow ways with curves and obstacles. Later levels introduce moving obstacles and parts in which the screen slightly tilts. The player is not allowed to touch anything and has to solve the coruse within a time limit.  This all is commentated by an enthusiastic announcer. Multiplayer is a simple split-screen race.",
