  "description": "This straightforward golf simulation has players taking on various Japanese golf courses on the pro tour. Officially licensed from the Japan Golf Tour association, it features a substantial lineup of real-world players using their 1998 data. Players can also create their own custom players and save that data on the game disk. Ten different officially-licensed golf courses from across Japan are playable, featuring accurate recreations of their real-world topography.<br><br>In addition to a single-player tournament mode, there are several different multiplayer modes. Two players can play together in a Match Play mode, and up to four can play together in the 18-hole Stroke Play mode. An online mode uses the 64DD's built-in modem to compete in a cross-country tournament with other players.",
