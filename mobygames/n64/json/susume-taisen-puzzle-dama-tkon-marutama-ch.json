  "description": "<i>Susume! Taisen Puzzle Dama: T?kon! Marutama Ch?</i> is a collection of three games:\n<ul><li>A falling block puzzle with similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a>. Blocks fall down in pairs of two which can be rotated. Matching three or more blocks cause them to disappear.</li>\n<li>The second puzzle game is a tile matching game with similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tetris-attack\">Tetris Attack</a>. Blocks rise from the bottom of the screen and the player's job is to arrange them so three or more of the same colour are next to each other which causes them to disappear. To do so, the player controls a cursor which is used to swap two blocks.</li>\n<li>The third game is a bowling variant. Here the player just sets the speed and direction of the bowling ball. If an ideal angle is met, the player character performs a special attack which clears all pins.</li></ul>\nEspecially the two puzzle games, which are either played against an AI or human opponent, are presented in a colourful anime style.",
