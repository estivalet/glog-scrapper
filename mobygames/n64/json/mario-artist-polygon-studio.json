  "description": "<i>Mario Artist: Polygon Studio</i> is an art program allowing players to construct their own 3D models and add colors and textures to them. These objects can then be inserted into pre-made movies and animations. Another notable feature is a series of microgames, believed to be the inspiration for the <i>WarioWare</i> series, as it includes many almost identical games. Other games allow the player to use their 3D models.",
