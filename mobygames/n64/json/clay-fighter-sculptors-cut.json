  "description": "<i>Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut</i> is a parody of one-on-one fighting games and features sixteen playable clay fighters, including Sumo Santa, Statue of Liberty, Booger Man and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Earthworm+Jim\">Earthworm Jim</a>. It is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/clay-fighter-63-13\">Clay Fighter 63 1/3</a>.<br><br>Like the title suggests, it is not an entirely new game but rather a different version of it. The most notable differences are the four extra playable characters and betterments in the 2D-style camera angle. You cannot perform unlimited combos anymore either.<br><br>Moves are a mix of standard punches and kicks (although not all of the contestants have hands or legs) and a large number of special moves specific to each and combos. You can sometimes interact with your environment by kicking your opponent through a door or window and continue on the other side. You can also end the fights with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>-style &quot;Claytalities&quot;.",
