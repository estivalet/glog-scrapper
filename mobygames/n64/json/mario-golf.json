  "description": "Since Mario rescued Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, he's been thoroughly enjoying his free time. Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. <br><br><i>Mario Golf 64</i> features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special &quot;Time Attack Mode,&quot; where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. <br><br>Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you'll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional &quot;Club Handicap Mode&quot; ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.",
