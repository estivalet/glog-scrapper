  "description": "The Nintendo Pokemon creations make their way to full 3D battles in a recreation of the Pokemon battle sequences seen in the cartoon series. All 151 original Pokemon appear in some way or form, either for you to battle with, against or for use on the Game Boy Pokemon series.<br><br>Using the Transfer Pak (plugged into the slot in the N64 controller) and a copy of any Game Boy Pokemon title, you can upload your Pokemon for battle in full 3D in either a full-on tournament (where you can win badges, money, items and pokemon), play mini-games or battle against friends.<br><br>And after the battle, any experience, pokemon or items gained can be transfered back to the Game Boy version.
