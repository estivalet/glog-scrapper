  "description": "<i>Nushi Tsuri 64</i> is a fishing-themed role-playing game. It was the first installment of the series for the N64 console and received a Japanese-only release.<br><br>There are 6 characters from which you can choose from before you start the game. Just like most RPGs you can freely roam the town, visit other towns as well, talk to NPCs and buy stuff which are mostly fishing-related. To fish you need to find a suitable spot and after catching a fish you can keep it to a water tank and feed it.<br><br>While walking random encounters can occur at any time in which you are transferred at a different screen and have the choice of either throwing stuff like rocks at the enemy to chase them away or run across a path-like bar to reach to safety and end the battle. If you choose to do the latter you are vulnerable as the enemy is able to attack you and have your health depleted.",
