  "description": "<i>Dezaemon 3D</i> is more of a game creator than an actual game. While it ships with two games, what really makes the cartridge special is the editor. It is far more than a level editor - you can use it to design your own 3D shooting game! In fact, both games were done with the very same editor. <br><br>Designing 3D models, doing textures and composing a hit song are no small tasks mind you, so if you are more of the impatient type, you can skip the editor and head straight for the two sample games, <i>Solid Gear</i> and <i>Usagi</i>. Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. <br><br><i>Solid Gear</i> is a &quot;serious&quot; (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. <br><br><i>Usagi</i> is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, missiles... and bunnies. A whole lot of bunnies.",
