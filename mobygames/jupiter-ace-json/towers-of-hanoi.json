  "description": "<i>Towers of Hanoi</i> is a puzzle game where the idea is to move a pyramid of seven disks of varying sizes in order from Peg 1 to Peg 3. You can move a disk to Peg 1, 2 or 3 but you can't place a disk on another disk that is smaller. As you move a disk your moves counter increases so the aim is to complete the puzzle in the fewest moves.",
