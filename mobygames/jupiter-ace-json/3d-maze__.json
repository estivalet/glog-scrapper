  "description": "<i>3D Maze</i> is a 1st person perspective maze game where you must move around a maze trying to find the exit. At the start of the game you can adjust the size from 3x3 to 20x20 rooms, before looking at a plan of the maze to memorise. When you are moving around the maze in four directions, you can bring up a map of the maze to help find your way around. As well as finding the exit, the aim is to also escape in the fewest number of steps and looking at the map for help.",
