  "description": "<i>Memory Stars</i> is inspired by the electronic game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)\">Simon</a>, from the 70s and 80s where you have to repeat a sequence the computer gives you. After selecting a skill level (1-5) you then see a collection of stars and a sound for a few seconds in either the top right, top left, bottom right or bottom left on the screen. You then press a number (1-4) where you think the stars appeared and if correct then the same position appears for a few seconds before a new position of stars appears. You keep matching the sequence until you get it wrong and it is game over.",
