  "description": "<i>Titan Defender + Dual Duel</i> is a double games pack that contains the following games:<br><br><b>Titan Defender: </b>In this 1st person perspective shooter, you are the Chief Engineer on one of Saturn's moons, Titan in the year 2085. Your job is to look after the power source that keeps the mining community running, microwave arrays, which orbit in space. A threat has now arose from the alien race Carians who are seeking to destroy communities and mining stations in the Solar System due to a Sigmagtobin Export Embargo which led to many of their colonies being infected by Chtorophage. You must control a sight and blast as many Carian Combat Scout Crafts as you can, as well as any Mystons floating in space. Using the sights decreases it's power so you must refuel with any microwave arrays, that you find. The screen scrolls in various directions when you move the sight.<br><br><b>Dual Duel: </b>A single screen game where you can play against either the computer or another player. You control a creature with a short tail and as you move around the screen constantly, the tail grows, which is the same for your opponent. The aim is to get your opponent to crash into your tail while avoiding hitting theirs and if either player crashes then they lose one of seven lives. You also lose a life if you move back on yourself and if both creatures hit head-on then the outcome is 50-50.",
