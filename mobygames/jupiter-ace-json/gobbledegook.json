  "description": "<i>Gobbledegook</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> clone. As always the player controls his gobbler through a maze and has to collect as many spots as possible without being eaten by the gooks that chase him. Eating a powerpack allows the gobbler to go after the gooks for seven seconds. If eaten by a gook the player loses one of his three lives until it's game over. Before starting a game the player can choose how gooks move at the junctions. Logic A means a random choice from all exits except the one entered while logic B means a random choice from all exits. Logic B is meant to be easier. ",
