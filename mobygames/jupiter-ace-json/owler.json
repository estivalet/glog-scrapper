  "description": "<i>Owler</i> is a word game where you have to guess a five letter word the computer is thinking off by using an owl to pick up letters. The letters sit on the bottom of the screen and change after a few seconds and you must pick up a letter with the owl and place it at the top of the screen. If the letter is correct then a tick appears underneath it but if wrong an arrow appears in the direction on how close it is to the letter A. You can pick the letters back up and place them on the bottom of the screen. As you fly around the screen, a gremlin flies around as well and if you touch it then it is game over.",
