  "description": "<i>Centipede</i> is based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/centipede_\">arcade game</a> where you control a craft at the bottom of the screen and blast a Centipede at the top of the screen, moving across the screen and downwards when it hits the edge of the screen or a mushroom. When you hit the Centipede it splits into two and moves in different directions, and hitting the new Centipedes creates more moving across the screen. Blasting mushrooms give you bonus points and you are able to move forwards up the screen a short distance. If you are touched by any part of the Centipede then you lose one of three lives.",
