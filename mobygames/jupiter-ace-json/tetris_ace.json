  "description": "<i>Tetris</i> is a single screen game where the idea is to stop falling pieces from building up and touching the top of the playing area. Each piece that falls one at a time, is made up of four blocks in various shapes, and can be moved left or right, turned left or right, and dropped down faster. Once the piece hits the bottom of the screen then it can't be moved or turned. As more pieces fall and settle on the bottom, you must try to make solid horizontal lines which when made will disappear and the blocks above fall down. Making so many lines moves you up a level and the more levels you play the faster the pieces fall down. You are able to see the next piece that will fall to plan your moves and when the pieces touch the top of the screen it is game over.",
