  "description": "<i>Ace Invaders</i> is a single screen side view shooter based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, to destroy aliens above. The aliens are in formation and move across the screen left to right and when they reach the side of the screen, they appear on the other side, one place lower. You are armed with missiles to fire upwards and there are four shields to protect you from the bombs dropped by the aliens, but the shields start to disappear when hit from the alien's bombs or your missiles. If you are hit by a bomb or allow the aliens to reach the bottom of the screen then it is game over. There is an option to play a Fast or Slow game.<br><br>The game was re-released by Micro Marketing Ltd with some slight graphical details and no option for a Fast or Slow game.",
