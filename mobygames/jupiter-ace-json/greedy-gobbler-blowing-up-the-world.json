  "description": "<i>Greedy Gobbler + Blowing up the World</i>is a double games pack that contains the following games:<br><br><b>Greedy Gobbler: </b>Based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/pac-man\">Pac-Man</a>, the game is a single screen maze game where you have to eat all the dots. As you eat all the dots, Ghosts move around the maze trying to kill you and if they touch you then you lose one of three lives. In the corners are four power-pills, and if eaten allow you to chase and eat the Ghosts for a short period.<br><br><b>Blowing up the World: </b>A cursor moves across the top of the screen from left to right above a map of the World, and when it reaches the edge of the screen, it appears on the left side again. The aim of the game is to keep bombing the world until it is completely removed before a timer reaches zero. You use the keys 1-8 which allows you to vary the distance of the bomb exploding from your cursor.\n",
