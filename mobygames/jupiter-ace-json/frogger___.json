  "description": "<i>Frogger</i> is a single screen game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/frogger\">arcade game</a>, where you have to get a frog from the bottom of the screen to one of five gaps at the top of the screen before a timer runs out. Your frog has to cross a road full of traffic which is moving left or right across the screen before attempting to cross a river with crocodiles. Once the road has been crossed there is a path to take a short rest bite, but there is a snake that moves along the path to avoid. To cross the river you have to use the moving logs and turtles but the turtles only stay above water for a short time. Once your frog is in a gap at the top of the screen you then attempt to get another frog to the top but cannot move into a gap already occupied. If you hit the traffic, snake, crocodile, fall in the water of move into a occupied gap, then you lose one of three lives.",
