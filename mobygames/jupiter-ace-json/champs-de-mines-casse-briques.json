  "description": "<i>Champs De Mines + Casse Briques</i> is a double games pack that contains the following:<br><br><b>Champs De Mines: </b>In this top view single screen game, the idea is to get from the bottom of the screen to the top. Problem is that the screen is full of mines that cannot be seen. You move one place at a time in four directions and as you move you will be told how many mines are next to you. It is game over if you touch a mine and you can adjust the amount of mines on the screen.<br><br><b>Casse Briques: </b>A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a> clone that sees you moving a bat at the bottom of the screen, left or right, and you have to hit a ball and remove bricks above. If the ball goes past the bat then you lose one of nine lives but the amount of lives can be adjusted.",
