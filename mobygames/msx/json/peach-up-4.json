  "description": "<i>Peach Up 4</i> is a magazine that was published in 1990 for the MSX2. It includes the following games and programs:<br><br>Disk 1; <br><br>* ???????:<br><br>In <i>Gurieru no Seihai</i> (The Holy Grail of Griel), you are Gurieru (Griel), a knight who must find the Holy Grail to defeat the Demon King. <br><br>The main goal of this puzzle game is to collect a key, in each round, that will open a door to the next round. But the path to the key and door is blocked by monsters, who do not walk across the field or attack you, such as slimes, ghosts and ogres. To solve this, you must first clear the path by picking up magical objects and use them in the correct order. Each magical objects can effectively defeat a specific enemy only once; Use the Magical Staff on slimes, the Holy Cross to defeat the ghosts and the Sacred Sword to kill the ogres. In the later rounds a new obstacle appears; tiles that only allow movement in one direction. One wrong move and you'll get stuck.<br><br>It should also be taken into account that only one item can be carried each time, and it cannot be dropped. That is why it is very important to make the right decision about which monster you want to defeat with the object that you now have in your possession. Otherwise, you can not grab the next object, because you do not have the right one to beat the monster that stands in front of it.<br><br>In some rounds, instead of picking up keys, you can also rescue women who are surrounded by the monsters. When you take a woman to the door, she will be very grateful. You will then be rewarded with an erotic image.<br><br>An editor is included, where you can make your own rounds. <br><br>The follow-up of the game, ??????? ?????? (The Holy Grail of Griel Excellent) was published in Peach Up Special 1991 and in 2005, a MSX1 remake of the first game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/griels-quest-for-the-sangraal\">Quest for the Sangraal</a>\nwas made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.<br><br>* ????????? (Bug fixes):<br><br>This program can fix the bugs of the vertical scroll shooting game ????? (Ultimate Peach) of Peach Up 3.<br><br>* ????????? (Peach Gallery):<br><br>A CG gallery of erotic images of naked girls that were send in by users.<br><br>Disk 2: <br><br>* OUTER LIMITS??? ????????????? (Outer Limits Bangai-hen: Pikopon Nuide Nuide Game):<br><br>In this game, with the girls of the Outer Limits RPG, you have to compare the outcome of the math problem above your character's head versus the one above the girl's, but if the answer is a higher number than the opponent you can hit her head with a mallet, before she blocks it with a shield. She can do it to you as well, though. At each 3 bonks, more of the girl in her naked state to be revealed. However, if you lose, this will happen to you. <br><br>* ????????? (Shenan Dragon):<br><br>This is a trailer of the RPG Shenan Dragon.<br><br>* Mailbox<br><br>Answering the questions of users.<br><br>* ???? (Editor's Note)",
