  "description": "Four magical rings were stolen from Custom Town. A bunch of sexy, but dangerous sorceresses terrorizes the land. The town mayor has no choice but to invite Rance, a freelance private investigator whose mind is mostly occupied with pretty girls and promises to pay him quite a large sum of money if he stops the evil. Naturally, Rance agrees. It's time for him and his trusty cute purple-haired sidekick Shiiru to fight evil once again!<br><br><i>Rance II: Hangyaku no Sh?jotachi</i> is the second game in the animé-style erotic role-playing game adventure series. The game is played from first person perspective, save for navigation in dungeons, where the player moves a cursor on a map to access various rooms. Rance and Shiiru can buy and equip weapons and armor. In  dungeons, the player will encounter enemies to fight in turn-based combat. The player will have to search for the enemies to make them appear.",
