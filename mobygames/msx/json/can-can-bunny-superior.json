  "description": "The second game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Can+can+bunny\"> Can Can Bunny</a> series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. &quot;Oh, if only I could get her&quot;, sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi's wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!<br><br>Compared to the first game, <i>Can Can Bunny Superior</i> plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Move&quot;, etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.",
