  "description": "The bar room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special double area around the edge and a special treble area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a bullseye right in the middle for 50 points and an outer bull around it, worth 25 points.<br><br>Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce the score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If the score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board, the player must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top.<br><br>Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of being as drunk as most darts players).<br><br><i>Wacky Darts</i> lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien, and machine opponents of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.",
