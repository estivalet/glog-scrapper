  "description": "Robin was repairing the Batmobile when he was kidnapped. Before Batman can contemplate rescuing him, he must reassemble the car from its seven parts. There are all over the Batcave, in this isometric arcade adventure taking in over 150 screens. <br><br>Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick up and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement while you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps you in the air for longer.<br><br>Short-term bonuses of invincibility, extra energy, and extra life and an enhanced jump can be collected, but there is also one which neutralises all power-ups. You have eight lives, but each cluster of Batstones acts as a restart point - when it is game over you can return to that spot, with lives and equipment as they were.",
