  "description": "In <i>Knightmare</i>, the player takes control of a brave knight named Popolon, who has to rescue his sweetheart Aphrodite from the clutches of the evil Hudnos.<br><br>The game is essentially a top-down shooter. Popolon can shoot arrows at his enemies, and at the end of level face bosses, such as witches, etc. Shooting monsters, avoiding obstacles, passing the bridges and collecting upgrades for his weapon leads him to glory. Digitized music and sound add more to the arcade-like gameplay.<br><br>This game may also be about <i>two</i> brave knights - you and your friend, who does the same for the victory on one screen.",
