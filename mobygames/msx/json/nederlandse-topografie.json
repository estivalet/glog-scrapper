  "description": "<i>Nederlandse Topografie</i> is an educational computer game which teaches the locations and names of cities and places in The Netherlands.<br><br>The game contains a map of The Netherlands with many names and locations of cities, towns, lakes, rivers, regions and provinces. There are 3 modes, which are Opzoeken (Look up), Overhoring (Quiz), Het Stedenspel (The City Game), and 4 difficulty levels. In Look Up mode you can type names of a city or river and the game will point it out on the map. In Quiz mode, the game will point at a randomly selected place and the player must type in the name within the time limit. The input is very strict, if the player makes a typo and misspells even just one letter it is considered incorrect.<br><br>The helicopter mode is the main part of the game. In this mode the game randomly displays the name of a city or location, and the player controls a helicopter which must fly to that location before the time runs out. When the helicopter is close enough to the target city or location, it will turn into a pulsating red dot. Each correct city or location is one point, get 5 errors and the game ends.<br><br>In Quiz mode or The City Game, after 15 points the game goes to a higher difficulty level and it will start selecting less common cities, smaller towns and more obscure rivers.",
