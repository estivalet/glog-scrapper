  "description": "<i>Road Avenger</i> dates from the era when interactive movies (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Dragon%27s+Lair\">Dragon's Lair</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/freedom-fighter\">Escape from Cybercity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/time-gal\">Time Gal</a>...) with film-quality graphics, but limited player movement, were highly popular.<br><br>Players assume the role of an angry cop on a wild ride as he pursues a gang of bikers who killed his wife. Players need to race through oncoming traffic, squeeze between trucks, trash motorcycles and steer through lots of explosions. The only thing needed are quick reflexes to follow the instructions on the screen (with an increasing difficulty) in order to keep the animation going.<br><br>The action is shown from a first-person view and fast-paced, while still maintaining smooth and detailed anime drawn graphics.",
