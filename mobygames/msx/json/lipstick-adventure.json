  "description": "In <i>Lipstick Adventure</i>, the player takes the role of Gorou, a young Japanese private detective. One day, a wealthy and powerful old man contacts him and asks him to find a box which - according to him - contained a family treasure. The young detective thinks that fortune has finally smiled to him, but when his pretty girlfriend Otomi disappears, he realizes that the mystery is bigger than he thought...<br><br>The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, with the usual first-person view and &quot;Look - Talk - Think - Move&quot; interface. There are no puzzles, and the game usually advances the plot when all the commands at a given screen are depleted, sometimes requiring to visit different locations several times.",
