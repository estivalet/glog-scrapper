  "description": "You begin the game as a robot, but immediately transform into a space ship. It is a straight top down, vertical scrolling shooter where you control a space ship and need to shoot down alien ships and bases. In the beginning your weapon shoots a kind of bullets only, but later in the game this can be upgraded to dual bullets and a laser. There are several levels and at the end of each level there is a &quot;boss&quot; fight.",
