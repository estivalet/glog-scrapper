  "description": "Despite it's name, this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Q%2aBert+Series\">Q*Bert installment</a> is not a port of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/qbert\">first game</a>, rather it's based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/qberts-qubes\">Q*Bert's Qubes</a>. The player doesn't even control Q*Bert, but rather the dragon Wrappy. The gameplay is still focused on forming lines of blocks that match a target color, while enemies constantly enter the playfield. However there are now many different layouts in 50 different stages. Also added are differently colored blobs that function as power-ups when touched. Blue ones for example grant invincibility.<br><br>Another addition are two-player simultaneous modes, where both players compete against each other, with or without enemies.\nThe first player to complete a line of five of his target alignment wins. If the time runs out, the relevant blocks are counted, \na draw leads to a round of rock-paper-scissors with a random result. ",
