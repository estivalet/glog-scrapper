  "description": "Based on a special effects movie, Space Camp takes place in space (it says so in big letters on the cover). You guide your spaceship through orbit, avoiding meteor showers, military satellites and other obstacles. The control method is much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Lunar+Lander+variants\">\"lunar lander\"</a> type games, but in zero gravity, so a quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly past.<br><br>After the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels. Find treasure by gliding across the panels and pushing the joystick button. Certain panels will lead you to hidden treasure chambers. All the while, you must watch out for the space station's guardian, which moves in your direction when you activate your thrusters or press the button. As long as you just glide, the guardian stays put.",
