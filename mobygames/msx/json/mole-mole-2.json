  "description": "The follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mole-mole\">Mole Mole</a> plays exactly like the original, which means that it is very close to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> but at a slower pace, since each move requires planning, whereas falling boulders won't kill you. Three difficulty levels are on offer: <i>Selections, Children</i> and <i>Experts</i>. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.",
