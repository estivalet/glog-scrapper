  "description": "<i>Theseus</i> is a smooth scrolling platform game inspired by the maze portion of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/major-havoc\">Major Havoc</a>. In each level, the titular character is trapped in a labyrinth, and must find a ring and a key before rescuing his girlfriend. <br><br>The labyrinth is oriented vertically, and must be traversed by running and jumping. Theseus can jump any distance vertically while holding down the jump button, and can maneuver in mid-air. Obstacles within the maze include lava and invulnerable creatures whose touch reduce the players vitality. There is also a time-limit for completion of the level. Having either the time or vitality reduced to zero causes the loss of the game. These can be replenished by collecting various objects scattered throughout the maze. There are also switches that open and close walls to aid (or hinder) progress.",
