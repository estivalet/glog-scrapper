  "description": "<i>Bug Byte's Turmoil</i> is a platform game starring Mick The Mechanic. \nHe works for Sheik Abdul Al Kohol, the dictator of El Khazi, who is known for his fabulous car collection.\nBecause Sheik Abdul Al Kohol doesn't pay Mick The Mechanic too well - he's getting payed in sheep's eye balls - he is going to steal the sheik's cars.<br><br>To do that he has to collect oil for the car to make it drive off to the next screen. However, the sheik's cars are protected by fanatical and murderous Arabian bodyguards.<br><br>Mick has to climb on and off ladders to collect the oil in his oil can and, when the can is full, pouring it down the grid into the car. Mick can also spill a drip of oil to let an Arabian bodyguard slip (or himself if done wrong).\nTools that appear occasionally on various places on the screen will give special bonuses when these tools are collected and returned to the workshop.<br><br>The cars in the garage are not visible at first. When oil is poured into the grid the car becomes more and more visible. The car becomes fully visible when it is full of oil.<br><br>The game features 26 screens and each screen has a different maze-like lay-out that contains multiple hazards and obstacles like springboards, walls that disappear, conveyor belts, elevators and rope swings. The cars become more expensive when you progress in the game.",
