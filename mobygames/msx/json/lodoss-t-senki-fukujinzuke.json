  "description": "<i>Fukujinzuke</i> has little to do with the Japanese pickled vegetables it was named after. Rather, it is a small humorous mini-game tribute to Humming Bird's role-playing game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/record-of-lodoss-war-haiiro-no-majo\">Record of Lodoss War: Haiiro no Majo</a>. Besides a sound gallery feature, the game consists of three mini-games. The first is a puzzle which requires the player to assemble a picture by sliding disarranged fragments of it one at a time. The second is a recreation of a typical battle from the role-playing game, featuring a party of high-level characters entering a castle and fighting enemies in a turn-based encounter identical to those of <i>Haiiro no Majo</i>. The third mini-game is a quiz concerning all things related to Record of Lodoss War.",
