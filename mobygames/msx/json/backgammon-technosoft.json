  "description": "The classic board game of Backgammon. The game board is displayed from a top down perspective and is laid out horizontally. The game can be played in one or two player mode. In single player mode the player competes against a computer opponent. The objective of the game is to be the first player to move all fifteen of their pieces off of the board.<br><br>The typical rules of Backgammon apply. Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponents pieces. Doing that will send their opponents piece back to their own home base. While it's a players turn, they can take back a move they made.",
