  "description": "<i>RADX-8</i> is a shooter where the player, like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/laydock\">Laydock</a>, flies over the surface of planets and tries to shoot down all enemies or just evade them. The player starts with 300 ammunition but must be very careful not to run out of ammo in the later levels. When a next level is reached, the player receives a bonus game if a certain score has been achieved, this score is different per level. After the tenth level, the game starts again with the opponents of the first level.",
