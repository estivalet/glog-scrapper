  "description": "<i>Badlands</i> is a laser disc game containing animated video sequences making full use of the graphical video capabilities and storage capacity of laser disc media.<br><br>In <i>Badlands</i>, a single player (or a second alternating turns) controls a cowboy named Buck, whose wife and children have been brutally murdered by a gang of outlaws led by the notorious Landolf. Now, all Buck wants to do is to avenge their deaths, and he can if he can kill every single gang member, including their leader Landolf.<br><br>First, Buck must find each and every outlaw, and luckily some of them are hiding out in the local town. Others, however, may be in a jungle with prehistoric monsters, or even a cave full of bats! When Buck finds an outlaw, the player must face that outlaw in a showdown. Buck will need to have fast reflexes to survive, because he must shoot and kill an outlaw before he kills him, or a life is lost. But, Buck cannot shoot an outlaw before that outlaw has drawn a weapon or shoot innocent people, because if he does he will be hanged or jailed and lose one of his lives!<br><br>Once Landolf is killed, the game continues with the difficulty level increased. The game is over when all of Buck's lives are lost.",
