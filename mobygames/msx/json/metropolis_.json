  "description": "<i>Metropolis</i> is a game inspired by <i>Trojan</i>, the coin-op arcade game made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Capcom\"> Capcom</a>. Something that differentiates it from other beat 'em ups of the time, is the fact that you will have to defeat all your enemies with a sword, and also protect yourself with a shield.<br><br>The argument takes us to a futuristic city devastated after a nuclear disaster, where the law of the strongest prevails. The protagonist (Geitor), controlled by the player, is in charge of pacifying the city. For this, you must go around the city to the headquarters of the Townsman to lead a revolt that would bring you to power and thus to the establishment of the peace in Metropolis. To achieve this your ultimate goal is eliminating the five nuclear tanks which are in possession of the evildoers of the city.<br><br>There are three races of thugs who will try to prevent you from reaching the headquarters of the Townsman: The Warriors of Death, leading experts in handling the sword and shield, as is our hero; The Dartfire, nasty-looking mutants who throw fireballs; and The Girlkiller, a gang of women who are as beautiful as aggressive beasts.",
