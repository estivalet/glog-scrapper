  "description": "This interactive fiction game is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,4151/\">Roger Zelazny</a>'s fantasy novels Nine Princes In Amber (1970) and The Guns of Avalon (1972).<br><br>The game begins with you as Prince Corwin forced to compete against your eight scheming noble brothers and sisters for the throne of Amber at the center of the one true world. Corwin must travel across the dimensions to this fascinating realm and from there rally forces against those who would oppose him. Unfortunately, things do not always proceed as planned.<br><br>When you wake up, you know little of this, as you have been knocked unconscious and pummeled with drugs. All you have is the address of your scheming sister.<br><br>The game is largely based around interaction with other characters, and can end in 40 different ways depending on how these work.",
