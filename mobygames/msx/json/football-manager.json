  "description": "The football management game style has been one of the most enduring since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,124895/\">Kevin Toms</a> pioneered it in 1982. You start in the 4th division with the team of your choice, and can play on indefinitely in the hope of reaching the top division and dominating it, as well as winning the cups. Players can be bought or sold, with their transfer values varying according to the size of any bid. Their skills and morale vary as the season goes on, with resting key players in easy matches often a key move. You can take out a loan, limited depending on your division, while day-to-day bills must be covered. Matches feature short animated highlights sequences of key moments (Text only for C16).",
