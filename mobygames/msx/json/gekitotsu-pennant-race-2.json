  "description": "<i>Pennant Race 2</i> is a baseball game and the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pro-yaky-gekitotsu-pennant-race\">The Pro Yaky? Gekitotsu: Pennant Race</a> released one year earlier. The game is very similar to its predecessor. The most notable graphical changes are introduction of smooth scrolling instead of static screens and the ability to choose between regular and roofed stadiums. The game features the same game modes: 1-player single match, 2-player game, pennant mode (playing the whole season), edit team mode and a mode that lets you watch two CPU-controlled teams play versus each other.
