  "description": "The main difference of this vertical shoot 'em up with its predecessors <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/power-strike\">Aleste</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/aleste-2\">Aleste 2</a> is that in this installment of the series you're not flying a space craft, not even in a remote way. No, you are in control of a robot (maybe a humanoid). You are running around defending and attacking the enemy while avoiding obstacles and holes in the ground. For the rest it's pretty much all the same: it's fast, has many enemies, hard to beat level bosses and has lots of power-ups. If you destroy a space ship you will be rewarded with power-ups.",
