  "description": "Apart from certain <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a></i> influences, <i>Mazes Unlimited</i> is a very simple maze game. You guide your smiley face around labyrinths filled with dots and monsters. After you have eaten all the dots, the maze is cleared and you start over. To defend yourself against the monsters, you have a limited supply of laser bolts. When hit, the monsters are put back to the position where they first appeared. You can select your maze, your speed, and the speed of the monsters.",
