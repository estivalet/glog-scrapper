  "description": "<i>Dizzy Dice</i> is a gambling game simulating a fruit machine. You start with a fixed amount of cash. As you play and get winning combinations, you'll have to choose whether to collect or gamble what you've won. After completing the fruit machine game, you'll get the chance to play a dice game where you have to guess if the next throw will be higher or lower than the current one. <br><br>Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the keyboard.",
