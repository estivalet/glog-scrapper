No matter what. He flies to a fruity place where a big spider has build his web. Doesn't Bertie know or doesn't he just care?<br><br>You control Bertie across the screen and must collect pieces of fruit. When you've eaten a piece of fruit it will be replaced by a portion of the spider's web and when you get tangled in it you'll die and the spider comes down to grab and eat you.<br><br>There are ten levels of difficulty ranging from 0 to 9. When the easiest difficulty level is selected the web of the spider is not visible at the start of a game. The higher difficulty level you select the more visible will the spiders web be.",
