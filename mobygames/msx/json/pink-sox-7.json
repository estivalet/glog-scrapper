  "description": "<i>Pink Sox 7</i> is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It contains another very short episode in the <i>Halftime Lover</i> series; like in the few previous installments, it is non-interactive. Otherwise all the mini-games in this volume are new. A mini-adventure entitled <i>G Gun-Cannon</i> introduces characters seen in other Pink Sox mini-games before (such as Sayaka from <i>Balancing Beam of Love</i>), and is mostly dedicated to lesbian sex between high school girls. Another very simple Japanese-style adventure is an erotic variation on the Red Riding Hood tale. Finally, there is also a simple slot machine mini-game.",
