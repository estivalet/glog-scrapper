  "description": "This is one of those <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Tron-Style+Games\">Tron-style</a> games where you and an opponent, either human or computer-controled, ride light cycles in an arena. This is very much like a &quot;snake&quot; game, but where the tail never ends, forcing you to go on as long as possible, trying to trap your opponent with your &quot;tail&quot;. This particular version is played until either version has died ten times, has optional obstacles and two speeds.",
