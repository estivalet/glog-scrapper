  "description": "<i>Dezeni Land</i> is a text adventure with graphics. The game's nameless protagonist must visit six attractions parodying well-known areas of Tokyo Disneyland of the early 1980's, find the treasures within and escape. The title itself is a pun involving Disney and a Japanese expression referring showing off one's wealth. The gameplay largely follows the standards of interactive fiction, including simple verb-noun combinations as well as directions (forward, back, left, and right) for navigation. The areas are accessed in a linear fashion; items needed to advance to the next attraction can only be founded in an earlier explored location.",
