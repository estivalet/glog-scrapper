  "description": "The day began with great news: the genius scientist Dr. Cooger phoned his friend, a young man named Cole, and told him that he has, in fact, invented a medicine that resurrects living beings! So, where's the catch? Well, there seems to be a tiny problem... the resurrected creature turns into a wild, murderous zombie! After such a &quot;resurrection&quot; (performed on a poor policeman), the great scientist and his buddy escape to the cemetery, where they accidentally drop the vial with the resurrection medicine...<br><br><i>Dead of the Brain</i> is a horror adventure game. Most of the time in the game is spent controlling Cole, exploring zombie-infested buildings and trying to survive. The interaction with the environment is performed by selecting verb commands, always available as an interface ( Look, Talk, Move, Get, Use, and Go!), and then clicking on the appropriate object/person on the screen. Though absence of real puzzles makes the game a Japanese-style adventure, the interactivity is higher than normally in games of this genre. The game also features timed tasks, when the player has to figure out quickly what to do before the heroes are killed by a zombie.",
