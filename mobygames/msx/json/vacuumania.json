  "description": "<em>Vacuumania</em> is a Pac-Man clone for the MSX platform featuring slightly different graphics, sound, levels, and ghosts compared to the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>. Rather than a partial circle the protagonist in this game is a vacuum cleaner, and as such must vacuum-clean each room; the ghosts of the original Pac-Man being changed into broom sticks. The gameplay is essentially identical to that of <em>Vacuumania</em>'s forebears -- gobble dust for points and dodge the brooms which threaten the player's vacuum. If the player has recently grabbed one of the special dust dots that allows them to eat the brooms then they can instead be consumed.",
