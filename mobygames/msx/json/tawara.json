  "description": "Kid Tawara has discovered the wreck of a ship carrying diamonds. His goal is to find one diamond hidden in a grain bag on each of four floors of the ship, before the wreck completely submerges beneath the waves. Of course, the ship is haunted. Spirit fires drift around the ship, and sometimes manifest as ghosts that will kill Tawara on contact. While the ghosts move slowly, Tawara's movement can be blocked by grain bags and larger spice barrels, which he needs to move before he can get anywhere. On the plus side, Tawara can throw grain bags at the ghosts to subdue them. Each throw costs energy though, and so only a limited number of throws are possible. <br><br>It is also possible for Tawara to explore the decks that are already underwater, but he has only a limited time before his oxygen runs out and he loses a life. On later levels, the submerged decks may be patrolled by sharks. The rise of the water can be slowed by closing the hatches between levels, but eventually the pressure builds causing the hatches to re-open.<br><br>There are a total of four levels of difficulty, and each difficulty has four screens.",
