The player takes the role of the pilot of the Replicart.<br><br><i>Replicart</i> is a single-player only <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Snake\">Snake</a> game variant. In each of the 300 stages you have to collect a certain amount of a substance called 'Biteslime'. Once you fulfill your quota you can enter the next stage through an exit that opens on the left side of the screen. Collecting biteslime increases the length of your snake. If the head of your snake hits a wall, an enemy or part of its body you lose a life.  <i>Replicart</i> enhances the basic Snake game formula by adding power ups like a Time Stop, which freezes enemies, speed increase/decrease or level warps.<br><br>The Famicom Disk System version has undergone a few changes. There are only 100 stages and after each 10 stages you have to face a boss, which must be shot down before continuing to the next set of stages.",
