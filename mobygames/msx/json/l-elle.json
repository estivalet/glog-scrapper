  "description": "Christmas 1999: an atomic war has begun. Most of the Earth's population was wiped out. Only a few millions remained. Three years have passed, and the leading scientists of the world started working on a project to re-build the planet. But not everyone agreed with them; some people were profiting from the chaos and devastation. Those people founded a terrorist organization called &quot;Black Widow&quot;, with the goal to impede the project. To counter that, project leaders hired a group of five trained agents known as &quot;Snipers&quot;. The protagonist of the game is a Class-A sniper named Joe, who is about to be trained by his colleagues...<br><br><i>L Elle</i> is a point-and-click adventure in Japanese style (no puzzles). The interaction with the environment is performed by moving the mouse cursor around; when it is possible to interact with an object, the cursor turns into a command icon (look, talk, push, take, etc., depending on the situation). The navigation is performed by selecting locations from a menu. The player advances by examining objects, talking to people, and unlocking new locations.",
