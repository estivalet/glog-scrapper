  "description": "<i>Time Scanner</i> is a pinball game. As usual, the goal is to keep the ball in the game by bouncing it back with the paddles. Hitting bumpers and other obstacles rewards points and completing a table requires mastering certain objectives which depend on the table on hand. Every table is divided into twp parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are:\n<ul><li>Volcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes.</li>\n<li>Ruins: In the middle of the table there is a &quot;collect ball&quot; hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole.</li>\n<li>Saqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole.</li>\n<li>The last table introduces <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a> elements: the player needs to hit blocks to vaporize them.</li></ul>\nThe first three tables can be freely selected and the last one is unlocked by beating the other three.",
