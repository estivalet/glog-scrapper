  "description": "In <i>Goody</i> you are a thief with a mission to break into a Spanish bank. In order to accomplish that you need the appropriate tools, such as a torch and pincers. On the way toward the bank you must avoid policemen, gorillas, kung-fu experts, women sweeping the street, paper airplanes, and other hazards. The game is a platformer with light puzzle-solving which requires usage of the correct object in the correct place, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Set+Willy\">Jet Set Willy</a>.",
