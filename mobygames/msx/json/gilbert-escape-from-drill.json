  "description": "<i>Gilbert: Escape from Drill</i> is an action game based on the animation series <i>Gilbert</i>.

Killing enough enemies on the same screen cause a power up to appear which can be saved for later (up to four) and has positive effects on Gilbert, e.g floating. The most important part of the town are arcade machines which lead to mini games.
