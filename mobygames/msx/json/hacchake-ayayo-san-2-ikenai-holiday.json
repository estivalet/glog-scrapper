  "description": "<i>Ikenai Holiday</i> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hacchake-ayayo-san\">Hacchake Ayayo-san</a>. It is a short visual novel focusing on the erotic adventures of two young Japanese girls, Ayayo and Tomoko. The game begins with the girls deciding how to spend the holiday. From that point on, depending on the player's choices, the story splits into three vignettes: going to see an erotic movie, buying shoes, or reading erotic books. Each story invariably concludes with a sex scene.",
