  "description": "<i>The 4th Unit 2</i> is a direct sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4th-unit\">The 4th Unit</a>. The young and pretty bionic soldier Blon-Win has exposed the dark schemes of the trade organization WWWF. However, a new conspiracy is rising. WWWF has employed another bionic soldier, a young woman named Dalzy, who manages to seal Blon-Win's psychic powers. Blon-Win is arrested by WWWF and must find a way to contact her friends, escape, and defeat the treacherous organization.<br><br>The sequel follows the same gameplay format, being a predominantly puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure with an interface that combines menu-based verb selection and interaction with objects and characters highlighted on-screen. Compared to the previous games, the gameplay is more streamlined and the menu contains less commands. Rarely used options such as answering &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; during dialogues or the command &quot;Rescue&quot; have been eliminated.",
