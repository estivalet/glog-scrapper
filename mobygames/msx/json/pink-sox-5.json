  "description": "<i>Pink Sox 5</i> is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi adventure <i>Who Is There</i>, its story advancing towards darker themes, as well as a very short non-interactive episode of <i>Halftime Lover</i>.  The mini-adventure <i>Balancing Beam of Love</i>, depicting the sexual experiences of a school girl, continues in a slightly different format with a point-and-click interface.<br><br>The other mini-games are different from those included in the previous volumes. They are: a simple action game entitled <i>Monkey-Mankey-Baby</i> (<i>sic</i>), in which the player controls a monkey and must imitate the movements of a comical human character by pressing different keys; a simple (no betting) poker game where getting better combinations removes lines obscuring an erotic picture; and a board game named <i>Adultic Time</i>, in which the player has to position fitting items on a board to match a character (e.g. a GameBoy for a school boy) to defeat an AI-controlled opponent who is trying to do the same.",
