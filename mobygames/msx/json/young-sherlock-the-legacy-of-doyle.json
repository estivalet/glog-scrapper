  "description": "On the December of 1875, a millionaire called Doyle was murdered and Cindy, his daughter, was found at the crime scene. Roger, her fiancé, hires a young Sherlock Holmes to clear her name and help on the investigation.<br><br><i>Young Sherlock: The Legacy of Doyle</i> is a Japanese adventure based on the movie <i>Young Sherlock Holmes</i> (1985), although it has a completely different plot. Controlling Holmes and Watson, the player must investigate the murder of a millionaire by questioning witnesses and investigating parts of London. The screen is divided in three parts: a window at the bottom for text output, and above it an illustrative picture and a verb list. The verb commands used to interact with the game world are &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;examine&quot;, &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;listen&quot;, &quot;show&quot;, &quot;take&quot;, &quot;inventory&quot; and &quot;use&quot;.<br><br>When the player walks from one place to the other, the picture portion transforms into an overhead map of London where a red square shows the position of Holmes and Watson. The player can move this square with the arrow keys, and position it over an interactive area to access it (the game writes a small description of the places the square touches).",
