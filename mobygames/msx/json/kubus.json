  "description": "<em>Kubus</em> is a basic vertical scrolling arcade game in which you, as an astronaut, have to collect the purple dots in a maze-like and cube shaped floor while avoiding enemy objects. \nOccasionally special objects appear which contain special powers, such as no enemies for a certain amount of time or invulnerability.<br><br>When all purple dots have been collected you can jump to the next level which are separated by a wide and cube less gap. This gap contains only some cubes if all dots have been collected and those cubes can be used as a bridge to jump to the next level.\nYou have only a limited amount of oxygen to collect all the dots and if you fail you'll loose a life.<br><br>It's only possible to move and jump diagonal. The game can be played at two different difficulty levels.",
