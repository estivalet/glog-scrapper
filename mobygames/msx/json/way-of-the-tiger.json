  "description": "Three distinct side-scrolling beat 'em up game sections await in this title, licensed from a series of Fighting Fantasy-style books. As Avenger, you must clear the world of evil so as to protect the innocent, using your superior strength. <br><br>The combat is split into Hand-to-Hand, Pole Fighting and Samurai Sword fighting, each of which are loaded separately from across 2 cassettes - a novelty at the time. In each mode there are 16 moves available, varying depending on whether fire (or the space bar in keyboard mode) is pressed. The moves are arranged logically, and reverse depending on the character's facing direction, similarly to the Exploding Fist games.",
