It contains many names and locations of cities, rivers and seas.<br><br>In Look Up mode you can type the name of a city or sea and the game will point it out on the map. In Quiz mode, the game will point a randomly selected place and the player must type in the name on time. The helicopter mode is the main part of the game. The player controls a helicopter and must fly to a randomly selected city or location before the time runs out. When the helicopter is close enough to the target city or location, it will turn into a pulsating red dot.<br><br>Additionally there is an information browser which shows data per country or a bar graph comparing all countries. The data includes the area in square kilometers, population, agriculture, industry and service industry data.",
