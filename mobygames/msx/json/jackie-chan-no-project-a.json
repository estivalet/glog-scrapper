  "description": "<i>Jackie Chan no Project A</i> is a side-scrolling beat-em-up based on the 1983 Jackie Chan kung-fu film of the same name. At the start of each level, the protagonist has just rowed a boat to the entrance of a pirate's lair. The goal is to enter the cave and defeat the pirate leader. The entrance to the cave is infested with bats. Further inside the cavern are some red henchmen before the final confrontation with the blue pirate king. The hero has a number of special moves such as punch, forwards and backwards kicks, flying kick and a downwards punch to enemies that have been floored. Fighting involves repeatedly hitting your opponent until they fall down, and then delivering a special knockout blow. Each move drains the player's energy, as does being hit by your opponents. At other times, energy is constantly replenished. Running out of energy causes the loss of one of your three lives, and loss of all lives ends the game.",
