  "description": "<em>Sport Racer</em> owes much to Konami's MSX classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/road-fighter\">Road Fighter</a>, but does away with all the fancy curves and artificial intelligence on behalf of the other drivers in order to fit within 8 kilobytes, which places it within the same category as some of the very earliest racing games.<br><br>The player's task is simply to drive his car on a straight road filled with heavy traffic. Use the space key to accelerate; the car will decelerate once released. In order to keep up with the traffic, players will often find themselves &quot;pumping&quot; the accelerator to keep the speed at a balanced level during takeovers and other sticky situations. Otherwise they risk running into either the car in front or the one behind. Players have five &quot;lives&quot;, and losing a life also means losing speed and precious seconds. A red gauge on the side of the screen displays the player's position on the track; a green one counts down the seconds in which they have to complete the race. The game has two levels with five races each. Each race has a different locale and time of day.",
