  "description": "<i>Pink Sox 2</i> is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi Japanese-style adventure (entitled <i>Who Is There?</i>) from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pink-sox\">previous game</a>; another scenario in the mini-adventure <i>Halftime Lover</i>; a simple card game of a slightly different variety (the goal is to run out of cards by selecting those of a higher value than the opponent's); and a mini-game that combines elements of quiz with tile-matching puzzle, leading to an erotic image different from the one in the first game.",
