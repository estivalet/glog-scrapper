  "description": "The game is based on the famous adult manga/anime series with the same name. It generally follows the main plot: the demon Amano Jaaku is banished from Makai (the demon world) to the Earth by the Elder, doomed to be trapped in a human body; he is given the mission of finding Choujin, the most powerful god, who is hiding in the body of a high-school student.<br><br><i>Urotsukid?ji</i>  is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing verb commands from the menu (&quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, etc.). Navigation is also done by choosing the command &quot;Move&quot; and then the name of the location. Most of the time it is necessary to visit all the locations and deplete menu choices in order to advance the story.",
