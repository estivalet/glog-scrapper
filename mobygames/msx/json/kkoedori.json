  "description": "<i>Kkoedori</i> is a Korean-made action puzzle game similar in concept to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/solomons-key\">Solomon's Key</a>. The player must construct and destroy blocks in order to access the key that opens the door to the next stage. As opposed to <i>Solomon's Key</i>, blocks can only be built diagonally upwards, like stairs. Deleted blocks can be used to trap wandering enemies. The protagonist can also wear armor that protects him from projectile attacks. ",
