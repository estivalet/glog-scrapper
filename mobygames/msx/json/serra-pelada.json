  "description": "<i>João Dente-de-Ouro (&quot;John Goldtooth&quot;) was a miner in Serra Pelada (&quot;Naked mountain range&quot;), a Brazilian region that had a gold rush from 1980 until 1991. He chanced upon an enormous 154 pounds gold nugget that received the nickname &quot;Foreign Debt&quot; by the rejoicing locals. Four days after that discovery, João and the gold mysteriously disappeared while the festivities took place.</i><br><br><i>Serra Pelada</i> is a text adventure from Brazil. The second adventure from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Renato+Degiovani\">Renato Degiovani</a>, it was developed with the same set of tools used to create <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/amaznia\">Amazônia</a>. It also shares the first game's limited parser (it recognizes pronouns, but can't chain commands), but this time the accentuation of Portuguese words is optional. The player has 8 days to find the gold nugget (in-game time passes faster than in reality). Once the correct equipment is acquired, gold can be mined and sold, and the money received can be used to buy some necessary objects and bribe other characters. As a navigation aid, a segmented map of the place can be displayed with the <b>MAPA</b> command. The main danger comes in the form of common thieves and the hazardous dilapidated topography of the region (the prospecting was performed in open air, there wasn't any mines).",
