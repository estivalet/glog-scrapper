  "description": "The development of the game is based on the Umberto Eco's novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, on which Guillermo de Baskerville along with its intrepid disciple Adzo de Melk have the order on the part of Abad of an Abbey (Abadía) forgotten of the hand of God, to clarify certain crimes that are granted to the hand of the Devil. With this attractive argument we became jumbled of such way in the game that until we do not solve it we are condemned to moor itself of permanent form to the computer.",
