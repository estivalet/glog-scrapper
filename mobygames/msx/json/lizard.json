  "description": "<i>Lizard</i> is a simple first-person dungeon crawler in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/spell-of-destruction\">Wizardry</a> style, though with a single player character rather than a party. The goal is to explore a maze-like pseudo-3D tower and locate a magical book that would help the hero to rescue a captured princess. The player can choose between the classes of Fighter, Thief, and Merchant when creating the protagonist. Town menu is wholly text-based. Battles are random and allow the player to either attack or use items.",
