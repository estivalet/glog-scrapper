  "description": "The year is 2042, the stage is a huge futuristic city Neo Kobe. Among the remains of passengers who died in a plane crash, experts discovered a strange biomechanical organism. Recent events proved that it was not the only appearance of a &quot;snatcher&quot; -a robotic creature who can masterfully disguise itself as a human being in order to infiltrate and to destroy human society. Gillian Seed, a man who suffers from amnesia, remembers just this word: &quot;snatcher&quot;. He joins the Junkers, a combat unit whose goal is to track down and to exterminate the snatchers, and is determined to find out the truth about those creatures and his past.<br><br><i>SD Snatcher</i> is based on the same story as the more famous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/snatcher\"> Snatcher</a>, but gameplay-wise it is an entirely different game: an RPG. You navigate your hero from top-down view, enter buildings and talk to people. In many locations you'll meet enemies who are visible on the screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a turn-based battle begins. You can choose to fire from a variety of weapons, and to target a specific part of the enemy's body. Targeting has a direct effect in battles: for example, shooting the enemy's gun will weaken it, destroying its wheels will prevent it from avoiding your shots to its face or body, etc. You gain experience points (&quot;rank points&quot;), improving in different categories (speed, defense, etc.). You also improve your weapon skills by continuously using the same weapon.<br><br>Unlike <i>Snatcher</i> with its &quot;serious&quot; graphics, the characters in <i>SD Snatcher</i> have a typically Japanese anime &quot;super-deformed&quot; style, which adds an element of a parody to the game.",
