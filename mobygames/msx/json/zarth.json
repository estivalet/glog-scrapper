  "description": "In the 21th century, powerful computer systems were invented. However, the humans failed to control them. Near the end of the century, one of such systems, Orion, triggered a devastating nuclear war. A few survivors found a shelter and went into a cryogenic sleep. A hundred years later, they wake up and go out onto the surface, to face a new, unknown world...<br><br><i>Zarth</i> is a text adventure with graphics. Like many other Japanese games of its type, it supports text interaction as well as commands assigned to function keys (e.g. those used for navigation). The player must explore the environments and combine verb commands with objects in order to advance. The game has a day/night cycle, and certain events may occur only at a specific time.",
