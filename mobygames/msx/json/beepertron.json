  "description": "Beepertron is a little musical game, reminiscent of the old electronic toy, Simon Says. The computer plays a short melody, up to 10 notes, on the on-screen piano, and then the player must play the same melody using the computer keyboard. After 7 false notes, the game is over.<br><br>The subtitle &quot;1 bit music game&quot; is due to the fact that the standard MSX sound generator isn't used, instead all tones are generated with the small keyclick circuit.",
