  "description": "Licensed around stunt legend Eddie Kidd, this game gives you the chance to recreate his death-defying feats. You start off attempting to jump oil barrels on a bicycle, with the bigger feats of jumping a motorbike over cars come later.<br><br>You get no speedometer to help you judge speeds, but you can learn to gauge exactly how the bike handles and what it can do.<br><br>You can position the start of your run-up, with wind needing to be factored in as an affect on the distance. Wheelies can be practices on the approach ramp. The further on you land, the better the score.",
