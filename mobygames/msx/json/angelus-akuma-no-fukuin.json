  "description": "Two horrifying incidents that happened in two unrelated places. A man in Peru, one of the constructors of a new dam. An American female exchange student in Japan. Both were suddenly struck by a horrible disease that deformed their faces... Two young special agents, Alice and Brian, are sent to investigate the mystery, that will lead them into a dark world of occult and demonic forces...<br><br><i>Akuma no Fukuin</i> (Japanese for <i>Devil's Gospel</i>) is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player chooses menu commands (&quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, etc.) that are displayed under a still picture that represents the location. Most of these command have their own context-dependent sub-menus, i.e. it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to look at different things and talk about different topics. There are no puzzles, and the story usually advances when the player has triggered a necessary conversation or event.",
