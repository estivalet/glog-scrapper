  "description": "<i>Otenba Becky no Daib?ken</i> is a platform game in which the tomboyish protagonist takes on an alien horde. The aliens are normally lethal to the touch but can be made vulnerable by trapping them in holes, which Becky can quickly dig in the ground beneath her. Becky is slim enough to fall through the hole to the level beneath but the aliens are larger and become temporarily trapped. If Becky walks over the top of a trapped alien, they turn into an apple and fall out of the hole, which can be collected to earn points. The screen layout and gameplay are very similar to those in the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Space+Panic\">Space Panic</a>. <br><br>After all of the aliens on a particular screen have been converted into fruit, the next level begins. Each level differs in the positioning of ladders and gaps between platforms, and appear to be randomly generated. The first level starts with three aliens which move very slowly. After four levels with increasing numbers of aliens, the next level increases the speed of the aliens but reduces their number back to three. The levels relentlessly continue in this way until Becky runs out of lives.",
