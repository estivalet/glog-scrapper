  "description": "The Eggerland series consists of several puzzle games. You play Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only colored red. It is up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.\nYou must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Luckily for you Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.\nThere are other types of obstacles in the levels, as well, such as water and Emerald Framers (green blocks that Lolo may push around freely).",
