  "description": "Gonzzalezz is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. The main protagonist is a Mexican stereotype (complete with sombrero and huge mustache), that has an obsession with the traditional <i>siesta</i>. The game is divided in two loads:<br><br>\n? In the first one, Gonzalez must escape his own nightmare. He moves by executing precise jumps in one big level divided in seven sections, a surreal landscape littered with dangerous objects like flying vacuum-cleaners, disembodied hands, etc. The <b>Q</b> key is the jump button, while the <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> move him left and right respectively.<br><br>\n ? In the second load, Gonzalez must find his hammock while avoiding the dangers of a stereotypical Mexican landscape (Indian tribes, wild animals, etc). Weapons and ammunition are scattered in one large level divided in sections. He can collect or drop these by crouching with the <b>A</b> key and can use them with the <b>SPACE</b> bar.",
