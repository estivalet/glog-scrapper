  "description": "A young adventurer is walking through the desert. Nothing but sand everywhere - it's hard to believe that 500 years ago a powerful civilization based on magic existed there, the miraculous land of Grad. Rumors of ancient magical items still hidden somewhere in this place have brought the young man to this barren wasteland. But the only thing he finds is a strange disc. As he picks it up, the disc glows, and a young girl appears in front of the astonished traveler. She says that her name is Physis and that she must find the underground palace of Grad, refusing to explain more. The hero, being the gentleman that he is, offers his help as the bodyguard. Physis leads the way, and together they venture into the deep, dark dungeon...<br><br><i>Gize! XIX</i> is a first-person dungeon-crawler with very simple gameplay. Most of the game is spent in the same location - the underground passages of the ancient Grad. The player navigates the hero through maze-like passages, with only his compass helping him to find the right way. Enemies appear randomly and are fought in turn-based combat. There are no equipment, items, or money in the game. Healing can be performed only though magic. Various companions will join the hero and offer their assistance in battles (such as healing spells). Only one companion can join at a time. The hero and Physis level up automatically after having accumulated enough experience points from defeated enemies.<br><br>The game contains nudity and sexual situations during some of the cut-scenes, but no explicit &quot;hardcore&quot; scenes.",
