The first being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sharp-mz-80b20002500/mystery-house\">Mystery House</a>. The objective of this game is to find a diamond with a market price of 10,000,000 yen that is hidden somewhere in a three-story building. Several items can be found that can be picked up and used in order to proceed. There are also various hazards that will get the player's character arrested or killed if not careful enough.<br><br>There are no room descriptions and the text commands are in very simple English. This has to be done in a two-stage input; you have to type a verb first, then press RETURN and then enter the noun. Example: Open - RETURN - Door. Movements can be done with typing forward, back, left, right, up and down.<br><br>There are differences between some versions: The text commands on the MSX are completely in Japanese, but still has to be done in a two-stage input.",
