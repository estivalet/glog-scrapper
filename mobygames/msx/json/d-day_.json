  "description": "<i>D-Day</i> is a scrolling shooter where the player controls a battleship sailing through the sea. The player has two weapons, a machine gun and a missile launcher, both of which have separate targeting reticles. The position of the two reticles is controlled by the same button, which (when held down) also controls the position and angle of the ship. <br><br>The enemies include bomber planes, ships and planes carrying homing missiles, gun encampments and tanks that shoot short-range bullets, as well as icebergs and sea mines which are dangerous to collide with. Each enemy is only vulnerable to one type of weapon. Planes and enemy missiles can only be shot down with the machine gun. Ships, gun encampments, tanks, bridges, icebergs and sea mines can only be destroyed by missiles. Enemy shots will gradually wear down the health of the player's battleship, while running ashore will destroy the battleship instantly. ",
