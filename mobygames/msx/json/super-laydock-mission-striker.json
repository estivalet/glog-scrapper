  "description": "A shoot 'em up game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Laydock\">Laydock</a> series that fits in perfectly between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/laydock\"> Laydock (Laydock 1)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Laydock+2\">Laydock 2</a>. It's again a game that can be played by two players though a single player game is also a possibility. If played by two players they can cooperate by docking the jets together, docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer.",
