  "description": "Kazuyuki is just an ordinary Japanese high-school student... or so he was before he saw a strange dream. In that dream, a girl was calling him from the outer space, imploring him to help her... The next day, Kazuyuki receives a strange phone call, after which he finds himself on board of a space ship! The girl from his dream appears and introduces herself: she is Marin, one of the members of a special squad that fights mysterious alien beings known as EX. Apparently, her message through time went to the wrong recipient, and now Kazuyuki is &quot;stuck&quot; in the end of the twenty-third century, reluctantly helping the beautiful ladies of the assault team to fight aliens - and perhaps engage in other, more pleasant activities.<br><br><i>Cosmic Psycho</i> plays predominantly like a typical Japanese adventure, with verb/object commands that must be chosen from a menu repeatedly to trigger the next scene. However, at certain points the game turns into a side-scrolling shooter. Clad in a flying robotic suit, Kazuyuki must blast his way through a (usually very short) stage filled with regular enemies and bosses.<br><br>The game contains scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.",
