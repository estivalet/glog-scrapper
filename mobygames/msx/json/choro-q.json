  "description": "The Choro Q video game is based on Takara's Choro Q cars (also known as Penny Racers). In each level of this platform game you - a Choro Q car - have to build two other cars. The components from which a car must be built are chassis, engine and coachwork, what of course must occur in the correct order. During your attempt to build cars you are pursued by hostile cars and tanks. When the first car is assembled entirely it then will change into a coin. Collecting that coin gives you temporarily invulnerability, so you can chase the hostile cars and tanks for bonuses. Don't drive too fast or you will fall from the platform or crash into the wall.",
