  "description": "The star of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/thing-on-a-spring\">Thing on a Spring</a> returns in this sequel. The evil Toy Goblin is up to his old tricks, with his giant toy factory producing thousands of evil toys. In order to shut down the factory, Thing must travel through the factory's 11 different levels and  collect the tape, floppy disk, listing paper and ROM chip scattered throughout.<br><br>The levels are filled with slopes, conveyor belts, interconnected pipework (years before <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>), and lots of foes to avoid. Question mark times have variable effects: stepping onto them reveals bonus points, objects, or a large weight that squashes Thing flat. <br><br>As Thing takes damage from enemies or weights, his oil level is reduced. When Thing runs out of oil, he becomes rusted and the game ends. To move between levels, Thing must enter the pipework through a vent and bounce around the pipes to find an exit.",
