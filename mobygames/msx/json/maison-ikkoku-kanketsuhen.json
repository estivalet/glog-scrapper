  "description": "The game is based on the manga <i>Maison Ikkoku</i> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,132555/\">Rumiko Takahashi</a>.<br><br>Set in Tokyo of the 80-ies, the story can be described as a romantic tale with a touch of comedy. It centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot line. The game's story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the conclusion.<br><br>The game is a &quot;puzzle-less&quot; adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, and Move&quot; typical for Japanese adventures (no &quot;Think&quot; command), but also context-sensitive commands &quot;Eat&quot;, &quot;Drink&quot;, etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.",
