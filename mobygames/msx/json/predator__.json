  "description": "Players take on the role of Alan &quot;Dutch&quot; Schaefer as he fights rebels in a Guatemalan jungle. Of course there is something even more terrifying than the rebels out there that Dutch will have to contend with.<br><br>Dutch is armed with a machine gun, grenades and mines. Use of these weapons will consume them, but defeated enemies will occasionally drop ammo refills. Dutch has a health meter so he can take a couple of hits from enemies before he forfeits his life. Dutch starts with six lives and can find extra lives throughout the game. ",
