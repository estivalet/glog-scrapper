  "description": "<i>Dragon Attack</i> is a vertical shoot-em-up for the Sord M5 computer. The game seems a mix between Space Invaders and Centipede, pitting the player against snake-like dragon enemies that split apart when hit. Otherwise, the game play very similarly to Space Invaders, with a crab-like protagonist (i.e. laser base), helping friendly clouds (i.e. bunkers), and a bizarre UFO analogue that can only be described as being the shape of a bell.",
