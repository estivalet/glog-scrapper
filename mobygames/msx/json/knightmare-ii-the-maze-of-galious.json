  "description": "<i>Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/knightmare\">Knightmare</a>.<br><br>The player controls the knight Popolon and his wife Aphrodite, on a quest to rescue the spirit of their unborn son Pamperses. The evil wizard Galious used his dark powers to ascend to the heavens and kidnap the baby's soul, and lock it away inside a prison in the labyrinth of rooms of his castle. The couple must transverse the maze-like building and travel to ten worlds, fighting against hordes of walking skeletons, vampire bats, and other bizarre creatures to finally reach Galious himself and kill him to liberate Pamperses' ghost.<br><br><i>Maze of Galious</i> is a game where you have to kill thousands of enemies, collect items in order to obtain new powers, and defeat bosses at the end of each level. You are free to go everywhere you want from the beginning of the game, thus you have to choose very carefully the order in which you visit all the rooms in the huge map if you want to keep your character alive.<br><br>The world is divided into a main map (called the Castle) and 10 sub-maps (called the Worlds). Initially you are in the Castle, and you have to find the keys that open the doors to go to each of the Worlds. To complete the game, you have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of the 10 worlds. You are free to revisit each world as often as you want, in order to see if you have missed something. Each character has special abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump and Aphrodite is able to dive.",
