  "description": "The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Tenshitachi+no+Gogo+MSX\"> Tenshitachi no Gogo</a> &quot;switches sides&quot;; instead of playing as the obnoxious male protagonist of the previous game, the player takes control of Minako, a female Japanese high-school student with a strong interest towards sexuality. The story mainly depicts Minako's sexual encounters with men and women, which take place on school grounds, in various locations of the city, etc.<br><br><i>Tenshitachi no Gogo 2: Minako</i> is an adventure game that has both text input and a set of verb commands (&quot;Search&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, etc.) attached to the function keys. There are no puzzles, but not every event in the game can be triggered by using the pre-set commands; often it is required to type in other verbs, using hiragana (Japanese syllable system) input via the keyboard.",
