  "description": "Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different <i>Lode Runner</i> arcade games in Japan, following the original game's release. Stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into <i>Super Lode Runner</i> for the MSX. The game also kept the two-player mode from the arcade version.<br><br>The game keeps the typical gameplay of the <i>Lode Runner</i> series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.<br><br>(This game shouldn't be confused with the NES game of the same title - it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.)",
