  "description": "In <i>Night Flight</i>, you fly an airplane above a city, leaving a trace of dots behind. If the trace forms a rectangle, it is filled in. What makes this difficult is the fact that you are chased by a bolt of lightning (let out by the thunder god, no less). From time to time, a shooting star also crosses the screen. If you manage to trap the bolt of lightning within your line, the level is cleared. Much like in <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/qix\">Qix</a>,</i> though, if the lightning or the star hits your line while it is being drawn, you lose a plane. However, lives are not lost just because a plane is hit. In an intermission, a plane flown by a comrade crosses the screen while you fall in a parachute, and with some luck or skill, you may guide the plane to pick up the falling pilot so that you are given a new chance.",
