  "description": "This is the second golf game from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=HAL+Laboratory\">HAL Laboratory</a> after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hole-in-one_\">Hole in One</a>. Like it's predecessor, <i>Hole in One Professional</i> is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective. Players can compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When playing against the computer, the player will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs.<br><br>In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow a replay of any spectacular shots that are made (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).",
