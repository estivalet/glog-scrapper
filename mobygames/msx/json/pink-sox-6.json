  "description": "<i>Pink Sox 6</i> is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the conclusion of the sci-fi adventure <i>Who Is There</i> from the previous games, as well as a new chapter in the <i>Balancing Beam of Love</i>, introducing a new heroine in a superhero comic book-like setting. There are two new mini-games: the first, entitled <i>PC City</i>, consists of a floating island and a few scenes (mostly involving young women) that occur when the player accesses various locations on it (such as a ship, an observatory, a medieval castle, etc.). The second mini-game is sub-titled <i>Let's Zazen</i> and depicts a comical Zen lesson as the player switches between pupils trying to avoid the master's blows.",
