  "description": "Have you ever wondered how and why evil appeared among us? It all started with jealousy. That was the first dark emotion that possessed human beings. Out of jealousy came doubt, then envy, anger, and finally hatred. Peace could no longer be maintained. Minions of darkness appeared among humans. The king and his counsel find a way to seal the heart of darkness, but it came to life again and destroyed the counselors. Now you, a nameless hero, is the king's and the country's only hope. Go, hero! Save our land from the forces of darkness! And don't ever, ever be jealous!!<br><br><i>Dark Sider</i> is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with slight erotic content. Along regular monsters you'll fight some who resemble scantily dressed sexy girls. You navigate your hero from top-down perspective, and fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.",
