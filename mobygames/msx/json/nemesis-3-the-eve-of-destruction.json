  "description": "<i>Nemesis 3</i> (<i>Gradius 3</i> in Japan) is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind, which can be collected to add more power to the player-controlled space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop the protagonist, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. The plot of the game focuses on the planet Gradius, which is involved in three space wars: versus Bacterion, Venom and Salamander.",
