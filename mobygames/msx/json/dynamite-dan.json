  "description": "You are secret agent <i>Dynamite Dan</i> and you have been chosen to save the world from the evil Dr Blitzen and his assistant Donna. After landing your Zeppelin on top of his house, you must explore the house and find 8 sticks of dynamite (left behind by a previous agent) and blow up the Doctors vault to get the plans for a Mega-Ray. The house is full of baddies and obstacles to deplete your energy bar. Your energy bar also depletes slowly so food must be found to keep it topped up. Points are awarded for various objects scattered around the house.<br><br><i>Dynamite Dan</i> is a flick-screen platform game similar to <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/zx-spectrum/jet-set-willy\">Jet Set Willy</a></i> where the joystick or keyboard can be used to control the hero. As well as the main playing area you can also see your energy bar, score and amount of lives..\n ",
