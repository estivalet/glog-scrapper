Readers are encouraged to submit their own works for upcoming issues.<br><br>After the editorial and information pages comes a picture, followed by an article explaining what the FM-PAC cartridge is. page 6 is dedicated to the art gallery. Since readers have yet to submit their pictures, rules are set and the saved bytes are instead used for a basic (it's even written in BASIC) paint program.<br><br><ul>\n<li>On page 7 comes the first game on the disk; a time-limited demo of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/power-strike\">Aleste</a>, occupying the eight following pages as well. \n<li>On page 16 comes a preview screen of the RPG <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/last-armageddon\">Last Armageddon</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=BrainGrey\">BrainGrey</a>. \n<li>On page 20 ensumes another non-interactive preview, this time of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Winky+Soft\">Winky Soft's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Akambe+Dragon\">Akambe Dragon</a>. \n<li>Interactivity resumes on page 24 with a demo comprising the Klondyke part of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Game+Arts+Co%2e%2c+Ltd%2e\">Game Arts's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Solitaire+Royal\">Solitaire Royal</a>.\n<li>One of the few original &quot;games&quot; may be found on page 27; a multiple choice short story about the boy Takashi and his quest to get a copy of &quot;Super Ultra Last Long Special Real Big Baseball&quot;. \n<li>Page 29 contains a retro game; a slightly remade version of Compile's old <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/hustle-chumy\">Hustle Chumy</a>.\n</ul><br><br>Not accessible from the main menu is the BASIC section.
