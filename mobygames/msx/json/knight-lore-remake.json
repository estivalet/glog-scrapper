  "description": "The <i>Knight Lore Remake</i> for MSX 2 adds colors, new graphics and animation to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/knight-lore\">original, monochromatic 8-bit game</a>, as well as a separate map screen of the maze showing all the rooms, marking the ones already visited and displaying icons of the objects on each screen. The map can be called with the SHIFT key. When used on a MSX Turbo R, the game activates the R800 CPU to prevent slowdowns.<br><br>The gameplay remains the same, where the player must guide the explorer Sabreman through a castle labyrinth, collecting all the ingredients for a potion spell. The daytime cycle occurs every few minutes, turning the main character into a werewolf when the evening starts, and back to human form when the dawn breaks. The remake has a darker, colder palette for night time. The quest must be completed in 40 days, roughly an hour of real time, to win the game and cure Sabreman of lycanthropy.",
