  "description": "Y?ko, the protagonist's girlfriend, has disappeared. In order to find her he must venture into the dreaded mansion inhabited by sex-hungry women. Though the game has a similar setting as its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/twilight-zone_\">predecessor</a>, gameplay-wise it is entirely different, being a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG. The environment in the game consists of several floors of identically-looking maze-like pseudo-3D corridors. There is no automapping feature. Enemies would randomly pop up; all of them are young girls, and the protagonist must have sex with them instead of fighting. Different sexual positions correspond to different types of attacks in more conventional role-playing games. Items and most other RPG-related paraphernalia are also expressed through sexual terms. Experience points and currency (which can be spent on items and resting in special locations) are awarded as well.",
