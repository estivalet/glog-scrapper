Once you have been brought down or tackled by the opposite players, both teams go into a huddle,which you then face an instruction menu, in this menu you control what you want the team do to next.You can bomb, charge, rush, kick and a few other instructions.Once you have selected what you want the team do next, either offence or defence, your team plays out the instructions out on the field.",
