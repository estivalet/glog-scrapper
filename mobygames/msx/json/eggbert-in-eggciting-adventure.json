Each stage is basically a puzzle, where you have to figure out when and where to use the items at your disposal. It is the predecessor of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=Toki+Tori\">Toki Tori</a> series.<br><br>At the start of each stage you get a given set of items. You can switch between the items with the graph-button and use an item with spacebar. The teleporter item allows for short range teleports, the materializer item can build bridges across gaps, eggzooka item can shoot eggs at enemies, clone item to clone yourself, the attractor item to attract monsters, electrocuter item to shock monsters, bubzooka item to catch monsters and a bubble item to move through water. Clever use and combinations of these items is needed to solve the more than 70 levels.<br><br>The stages are divided into different worlds, each with a different graphical setting; Forrest world, Bubbels world, Chips world and Slime world.",
