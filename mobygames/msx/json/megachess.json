  "description": "&quot;Megachess&quot; is a program with modest graphics but certainly with a great intelligence, a proof of that are its 6 difficulty levels, all of them very well differentiated. On the other hand, this game also has an analysis option that can be very useful at the time of practicing or taking to board one of those listings which are so frequent on the press.",
