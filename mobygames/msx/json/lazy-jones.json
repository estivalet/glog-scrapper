  "description": "Welcome to the World of Lazy Jones. You play the role of a janitor in this game, a lazy janitor that sneaks into back rooms and plays computer games. You can move around from floor to floor, and go into the back rooms and play the old (and I mean old) computer games that are in these rooms. Be careful you wouldn't want to get caught by security guards that are roaming the floors. There are 18 rooms to choose from, there are 3 that actually aren't games, and of course everyones favorite, the one that isn't a classic game, but you are just trying to get drinks off of the bartender, while avoiding the drunk.",
