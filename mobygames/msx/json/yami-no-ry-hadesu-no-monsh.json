In this top-view game you control a brave and handsome knight, Leon, that has to shoot bullets at various types of enemies. Shooting a series of enemies can grant you invulnerability or a shield.\nYou have to avoid obstacles and shoot at them at the same time because they can contain power-ups for your weapons.\nAt the end of each level is an end boss that has to be defeated before you can continue to the next level.",
