  "description": "Years have passed since the evil Crimson was defeated. Peace was restored, and humanity enjoyed an era of prosperity. But a new demonic being has arisen, ending the peace in the world. Five heroes must find each other and unite in order to vanquish him.<br><br>The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/crimson\">Crimson</a> retains the basic gameplay of its predecessor and is a medieval-themed role-playing game with overhead exploration and first-person turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. The first part of the game is broken into chapters, each dedicated to one of the five heroes; afterwards, they are united as a party and continue the quest together, similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dragon-warrior-iv\">Dragon Quest IV</a>.",
