  "description": "The principal of the Pocky Private High School is a lecherous man who thinks only about having sex with female students. One day he announces a competition for the male students, promising a reward for the one who brings him most girls' underwear. The protagonist is one of these students who must succeed in this dubious enterprise.<br><br><i>Pocky</i> is a first-person adventure game. A fairly long list of verbs appears on the side of the screen at most locations. These verbs can be combined with objects from sub-menus. The player character can for the most part freely move between various locations in and around the campus. There are no real puzzles, but certain items must be acquired and used at appropriate locations to unlock new areas or otherwise advance the plot. ",
