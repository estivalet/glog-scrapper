  "description": "<b>Quinpl</b> is a japanese puzzle game of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/kings-valley-ii\">King's Valley II</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/eggerland-mystery\">Eggerland Mystery</a> variety. The main objective is to reach a exit door by jumping over and destroying blocks and monsters. The player's character can shoot stakes that kill the monsters and stick to the blocks (he can jump on these stakes and eventually break those blocks, clearing the path to the exit door). If he touches any of the monsters or dangerous environments, he transforms into a blue frog and the player loses one life. There are several items that can be collected: some of them are immobile, some randomly float around the screen.<br><br>On the top of the screen there are a inventory of collected items, a timer and the number of lives. Both the cartridge and disk versions allow saving the game between levels.",
