  "description": "<i>Double Vision</i> is a combined release of <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/bishjo-shashinkan-moving-school\">Bish?jo shashinkan: Moving School</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bish%c5%8djo+shashinkan%3a+Studio+Cut\">Bish?jo shashinkan: Studio Cut</a></i>, neither of which were released separately for the MSX or X68000. Both games put you as a photographer trying to take photos of schoolgirls, where you must use your judgment to set exposure correctly. As the game(s) progresses, the option to use an automatic camera is removed, forcing you to correctly guess both aperture, shutter speed, film sensitivity and if flash should be used.",
