  "description": "<i>New Boggle Boggle 2</i> looks and plays identically to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/new-boggle-boggle\">New Boggle Boggle</a>. It features 150 stages, most of which are exclusive to it (though some are exact replicas of the previous game's stages), and a few new types of enemies. Otherwise, the game is indistinguishable from its predecessor. ",
