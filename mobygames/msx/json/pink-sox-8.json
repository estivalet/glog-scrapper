  "description": "<i>Pink Sox 8</i> is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. This volume contains an episode in the mini-adventure <i>G Gun-Cannon</i> which began in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pink-sox-7\">previous installment</a> and features the recurrent protagonist Sayaka as she is being molested by a gang of genetically mutated students. The non-interactive story <i>Halftime Lover</i> is concluded in this volume as well.<br><br>The only other mini-game in this installment is entitled <i>Sim Girl</i>. Rather than being a true simulation game, however, it is a simple arcade-style game where the player moves a paddle left and right, trying to connect with falling objects such as rocks, chunks of meat, Y chromosomes, etc. Depending on the type and the amount of objects caught the player is treated to view a picture of the creature that has evolved as a result.",
