  "description": "<i>Block Hole</i> is a mash-up between a Tetris style game and a shooter. It can be played in single or dual player mode. The game play is very similar, but inferior to Konami's Quarth.<br><br>You can move only from right to left while the screen scrolls down. The playing field is filled with different blocks and your aim is to fill them in so they form complete rectangles or squares. Only when you succeed in this mission, the concerned blocks will disappear. New 'unformed' blocks appear while the playing field scrolls down making you play into full action at all times. As soon as a line of blocks reaches the bottom line, it is Game Over.",
