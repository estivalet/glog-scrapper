  "description": "<i>Panzer Attack</i> is a computerised wargame similar to the board-game Risk, representing World War II's crucial Battle of the Bulge. The player represents General Hodges, a commander of the US forces, while the computer always plays the German side. The gameplay is turn-based - you move all your tanks using map references, then the computer does the same.<br><br>You have to try to protect your fuel dumps against the Germans. The difficulty can be determined by setting how many German divisions are attacking - the default is 200. Intelligence advice you receive is not always accurate, so pay attention to what you can see on the map.",
