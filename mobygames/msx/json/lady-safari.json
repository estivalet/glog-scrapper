  "description": "Probably one of the earliest photo-shooting games, as popularised by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pokmon-snap\">Pokémon</a> and various paparazzi/stalking games, Lady Safari comes with an extra sexist twist.<br><br>You have a blonde and a dark-haired long-legged lady to choose from, both dressed in nothing more than a tanga leotard and a pair of boots. You must control your lady on a journey through an African jungle. Along the road are cameras on tripods for you to look through in the hope of snapping an animal. If you get them on film, they end up in your photo album. The road through the jungle is filled with dangerous animals such as spiders and snakes, and even flesh-eating plants. You must also traverse rivers on small rafts. Since the road is narrow and you lack any offensive capacity, you must look carefully where you tread, or your scantily-clad lady will fall prey to the dangers of the African wildlife.",
