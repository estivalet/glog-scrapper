  "description": "<i>King's Valley 2</i> is a puzzle game and a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=King%27s+Valley\">King's Valley</a>. Once again you need to collect all treasures by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck and will have to play the whole level again. You will be given a password code after each completed pyramid. The game has a stage editor, so you can build and play your own puzzle stages.",
