  "description": "In the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Way+of+the+Tiger\">The Way of the Tiger</a>, Yaemon the Grand Master of Flame is the villain of the piece. He has killed your foster-father Naijish and stolen the Scrolls of Kettsuin.<br><br>Your quest to recover the scroll and avenge your father's death is viewed from above and superficially resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>. You start outside the  Quench Heart Keep, and must initially find enough keys in the grounds and connected buildings to penetrate it, and then kill each of the 3 guards.<br><br>There are other prey including spiders to fend off - these know how to home in on you. You are armed with a limited number of Shuikch to shoot from distance; after these are gone you are reliant on your bare hand, although more can be collected. Pressing the 1 key summons an energy recharge from the God Kwon, but only a limited number of times.",
