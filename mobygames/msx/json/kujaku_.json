  "description": "<i>Kujaku?</i> is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the late eighties and drawn by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Makoto+Ogino\">Makoto Ogino</a>. The story is centered around the demon-hunting Buddhist monk Kujaku, who gets send out by his master to investigate rumors about attacks on a nearby temple, which ultimately leads him on a quest to stop a demon clan from summoning their Dark Lord into the world.<br><br>The game is a menu-based adventure game with verbs like &quot;go&quot;, &quot;speak&quot;, or &quot;look&quot; being the first menu choice, followed by objects/nouns in subsequent menus. From time to time Kujaku encounters enemies which he has to battle in a short combat sequences, which work similar to turn-based RPGs from that era (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/dragon-warrior\">Dragon Quest</a>). During combats, options are limited to fight, run away or use one of several prayers, which work as sort of magical spells.<br><br>The game's story and gameplay resembles Sega's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/spellcaster\">Kujaku?</a> version for the Sega Master System, at least to its adventure part, because there are no action sequences in this version of the game.",
