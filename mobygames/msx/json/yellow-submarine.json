  "description": "<i>Yellow Submarine</i> is a variant of the submarine game, one of the oldest versions of which is the Atari 2600 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/air-sea-battle\">Air-Sea Battle</a>(1977). The premise is that the player, as captain on a submarine, must shoot at mine-releasing surface ships and sub-hunting planes, all the while avoiding enemy submarines and their torpedoes. The key to playing the game correctly is to properly time the missiles/torpedoes, as well as taking their trajectory into account.",
