  "description": "The third entry in Zemina's unlicensed conversions of early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Mario\">Super Mario Bros.</a> games differs from its predecessors by having its own levels. While the two first games imported levels of their correspondent Mario counterparts, <i>Super Boy III</i> does not copy the stages of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros-3\">Super Mario Bros 3.</a>. Instead, it utilizes elements from previous Mario games as well as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Super+Mario+World\">Super Mario World</a>, from where some enemies and level design ingredients are borrowed.<br><br>Unlike those two games, however, <i>Super Boy III</i>  has completely linear levels that must be traversed in a particular order. There are no special levels such as castles, no familiar bonuses, and no power-ups besides those that were introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/super-mario-bros\">first Mario</a> game. Mario also walks and runs significantly slower than in Nintendo games. At the end of each stage Mario has to defeat a Hammer Brother.",
