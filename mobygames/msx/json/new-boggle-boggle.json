  "description": "<i>New Boggle Boggle</i> is an arcade-style platformer very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Bubble+Bobble\">Bubble Bobble</a>. In a single-player game the player controls a green dragon; two-player mode adds a blue one. Both dragons try to complete one-screen stages by eliminating all the enemies running, jumping, and floating around the screen. The dragons can jump and trap enemies in bubbles, which is the only way to destroy them. Once an enemy is caught in a bubble, it is immobilized for a while and begins to slowly drift upwards. The dragon must jump on the bubble to finish off the enemy and retrieve a score-increasing item.",
