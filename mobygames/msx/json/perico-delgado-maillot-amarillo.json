  "description": "<i>Perico Delgado Maillot Amarillo</i>, a game based on the Spanish champion, was one of the first cycling simulators that reproduced accurately the ups and downs of one of the hardest sports. Here you can run in a singular test (after seeing the informative track profile), divided each one in four completely different parts and in which your reflections will be continuously put on approval. <br><br>Try to start the race in first position and obtain a perfect rate in your pedaling, at the same way you avoid the dangerous fans in smooth land; run in the hardest of the mountain ports in continuous struggle against the chronometer; descend at full speed through a street flooded of curves and finally arrive to the final sprint, showing that you are worthy to take the yellow jersey.",
