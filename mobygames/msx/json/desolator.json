  "description": "Desolator is best described as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Defender\">Defender</a> without the little men. What is still there is the fast horizontally scrolling landscape, the green aliens (also known as the Gargoans), the radar and, to a certain extent, the rescue objectives. For lack of humans to rescue, you must instead capture the &quot;Energiser&quot;; an object which certain enemies will try to steal.<br><br>The game has, just like other Defender-like games, several types of enemies, from the rather dumb basic aliens, to stationary objects with high firepower, and quick hunters which might crash into you. Each level has a specific objective, though it is usually finished by killing everything that moves. As a last-ditch effort, you can activate the &quot;desolator&quot;, which is a fancy name for a smart bomb device, killing everything on-screen.",
