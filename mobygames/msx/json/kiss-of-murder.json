  "description": "<i>Kiss of Murder</i> is an adventure game set in a parallel world to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/manhattan-requiem\">Manhattan Requiem</a>. While it features the same graphics and set of characters as that title, it has a completely different story. In Manhattan a large blue sapphire has been stolen and a young woman named Sarah Shields who worked at a jewelry store has been murdered. Insurance investigator Judd Gregory has contacted the private detective <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=J%2eB%2e+Harold\"> J.B. Harold</a> and asked him for help with the case. Gameplay involves going to various locations in New York, talking to people, interrogating suspects, finding clues and gathering evidence.<br><br>Early releases of the game (PC-88, X68000, FM-7, X1 and PC-98) are add-ons and require Manhattan Requiem to play. Later iterations became stand-alone.",
