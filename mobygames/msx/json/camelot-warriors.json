Four elements from the 20th century have entered the world of Camelot: &quot;The voice of another world&quot;, &quot;Wisdom mirror&quot;, &quot;The life elixir&quot; and &quot;The fire that doesn't burn&quot;. You must take them and present them to the guardians of each world, who will be in charge of their destruction.<br><br><i>Camelot Warriors</i> is an action game with platforming elements. You must travel through four different worlds populated by many enemies. Forests, lakes, caverns and finally, the Castle of Camelot are awaiting you.",
