  "description": "The young Satoshi Kanou attends  a prestigious art school. One day, the students are invited to a party in Professor Tsukishima's mansion. The hero becomes acquainted with the professor's young daughter, and her father eventually hires him as a private tutor. But it all goes wrong when a terrible accident involves the young hero into a net of mystery and intrigues. Soon he realizes that an innocent person's life might be in danger. The private tutor becomes a private detective...<br><br><i>Kurutta Kajitsu</i> is a rather standard Japanese-style adventure gameplay-wise. Typically for the genre, the player advances the story by repeatedly selecting verb commands (&quot;Examine&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, etc.) from a menu. Most of the time the player is free to move between various locations (also menu-wise) to explore the game world, talk to characters, and solve the mystery. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual content.<br><br>",
