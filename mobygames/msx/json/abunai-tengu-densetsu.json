  "description": "Kazumi Kinoshita and Sanae Kanazawa are two high school girls who go on a school trip together with their classmates. Shortly after their arrival at the camp dormitory, various girls become targeted by unknown assailants. In order to solve the mystery the two heroines must talk to their classmates, collect clues, and eventually find the culprits.<br><br><i>Abunai Tengu Densetsu</i> is an adventure game with menu-based navigation and input. Most screens offer a fairly long list of verb commands, some of which must be combined with objects or persons selected from a sub-menu in order to interact with the environment. The game allows the player to visit many different rooms and other locations in any order; however, certain events must be triggered in order to advance, sometimes by repeatedly selecting commands. Certain situations require the player to find items and use them in a different location. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.",
