  "description": "J-war, Eisbaer23 and Tapeworm, three MSX sceners, have borrowed Snout's holiday house. Each day, they run naked through the fields of flowers surrounding the house, which makes them feel erect. One day, J-war forgets to take his pills. Instead, he takes some of the mushrooms growing in the environs, and loses his senses.<br><br>In this platform-puzzle game, which plays like a deranged <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jet+Set+Willy\">Jet Set Willy</a>, you guide the naked J-war around the one-screen platform levels, trying to pick up all the pills and mushrooms. You are chased by a set of clothes, contact with which must be avoided. When you eat pills, you move quickly but jump poorly. Eating mushrooms makes you slow, but jump far. Taking this into consideration is the key to successfully completing the level. Some places can only be reached by eating mushrooms, and when you eat the pills in that place, you are quick enough to run away from the shirt and trousers.<br><br>This libelous game was coded for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.",
