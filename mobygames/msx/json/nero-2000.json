  "description": "<i>Nero 2000</i> is a trivia quiz game released in Finnish only. You choose to compete in four question categories, each including approximately 500 questions.<br><br>The categories are:\n<ol>\n<li>Sports, dialect words and foreign words\n<li>General knowledge, geography and literature\n<li>Travel, literature, general knowledge and nature\n<li>General knowledge, art and movies\n</ol>\nThe game can be played against the computer AI or a human opponent on a shared computer. Answers need to be typed on a keyboard. The game proceeds in turns.<br><br>The game can be won in two ways. One is to get all the points from your opponent and another way is to get all ten &quot;correct answer&quot; -markers (light bulbs on Commodore version) lit before your opponent does so. These markers are lit whenever you answer a question correctly, unless you choose before seeing a new question to attack your opponent and try to black out one of their markers with your correct answer instead. In a single player game, the AI opponent never answers a question, but gets a marker lit whenever you answer incorrectly.<br><br>Both players start with 100 points and they may choose to bet any number of the points before a question is revealed. This amount of points will be stolen from your opponent upon a correct answer and lost when the answer is incorrect. There is also a randomized bonus multiplier of 2 to 4 to the initial bet, which is given to the winner, but not reduced from the loser's points. Running out of points will end the game as well.",
