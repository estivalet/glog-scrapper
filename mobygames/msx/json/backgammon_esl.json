  "description": "A computer version of the classic board game Backgammon. The game board is displayed from a top down perspective. The game lets the player compete against a computer opponent. The objective of the game is to be the first player to move all fifteen of their pieces off of the board.<br><br>The typical rules of Backgammon apply. Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponents pieces. Doing that will send their opponents piece back to their own home base.",
