  "description": "<i>Alien Egg</i> is a text adventure game for the Atari 8-bit computer.<br><br>You're a biologist and the only non-engineer among the spaceship's crew.  To make yourself useful, you've volunteered for the cryogenic deep freeze experiment.  You've been on ice for fifty years, the time it has taken the crew to fly to the newly discovered planet Xepa, where they are to capture an alien egg and return it to Hoboken for analysis.  Your time is up.  The freezer lid opens automatically.  You leap out, eager to take center stage away from all those engineers.  But wait, something's wrong.  A deadly silence replaces the normal hustle and bustle of the crew's activities.<br><br>All entries are via VERB NOUN entry, and the goal is to to figure out how to suit up, exit the spacecraft, capture an alien specimen, and return it to the ship's lab.  There are multiple inventory-based puzzles to solve. The player can request hints in each room, for a clue on how to proceed. There is no save/restore feature.  <br><br>",
