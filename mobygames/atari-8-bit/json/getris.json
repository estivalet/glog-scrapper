  "description": "A falling block puzzle game with an extravagant presentation. Differently arranged pieces (one at a time) are slowly falling into a pit, and you have to manage them around until they reach a stationary state at the bottom of the free space. When the tiles constitute complete rows, those rows disappear and you get points for it. If there are gaps in the rows, the pieces pile up, and the game ends if the pile reaches the top of the pit. There is a window that shows you the following piece. You can move the pieces horizontally, rotate them, or make them fall faster while holding the fire button.<br><br>Distinctive features are: There are some unusual pieces with 3 to 5 tiles. The game is separated into rounds. There is a meter that advances when you make complete rows, and the round ends when the meter reaches maximum. There is also a selection of tunes, and a randomly chosen one plays during the round. The graphics around the playfield uses an interlacing trick.",
