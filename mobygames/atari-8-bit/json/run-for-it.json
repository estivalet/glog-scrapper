  "description": "<i>Run For It</i> is a 1-player arcade platformer.<br><br>The player controls a Orbit the Robot whom is capable of jumping to platforms, but can also duck through small spaces.  The robot is armed with a small gun, which can shoot enemy creatures. The player must navigate a maze which contains a number of interconnected screens with various platform design.  The goal is to progress as far as possible in a maze during the time available.  The player progresses steadily upwards, with the endpoint being found on level R. A timer in the top right corner rapidly ticks down, and the player can pick up tokens which prolong the time remaining.  If the player comes in contact with an enemy, time is lost.  ",
