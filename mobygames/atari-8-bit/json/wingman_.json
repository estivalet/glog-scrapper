  "description": "<i>Wingman</i> is a split-screen side-scrolling flight game for one to four players.<br><br>Played from a split-screen perspective, two planes fly independently. In a single-player game, the second plane is controlled by the computer and aids the player.  With more players, players can choose to play cooperatively or compete against each other.  One team controls five sectors on the left of the gameplay area, while the other team controls five sectors on the right, with two empty sectors in between.  If the wingman is computer controlled, he can be given different control instructions, such as defending friendly territory, attacking enemy territory or protecting the human player. <br><br>Planes can be armed with high-explosive bombs, air-to-air missiles, or 20 mm cannons.  These have different efficiencies against ground and air targets, and also heavier weapons slow the plane's speed. The player scores points by destroying enemy aircraft and ground installations, with buildings further into enemy territory worth more points.  Each team is provided 3 flight squadrons (2 aircraft) to try to maximize their score, and in versus games, the player who scores the most points is victorious.",
