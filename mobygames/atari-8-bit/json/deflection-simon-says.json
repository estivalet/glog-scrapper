  "description": "<i>Deflection / Simon Says</i> is a compilation if two games for 8-bit Atari systems.<br><br>In <i>Deflection</i>, a bouncing ball moves about the screen.  The player can redirect its movement by pressing the &quot;/&quot; key, which creates a slanted border which redirects the ball's movement.  The goal is to collect the icons spread throughout the screen, by directing the ball onto their location.  The player's score is based upon the number of bounces and borders required to collect the icons.  The ball can become lodged in the far corners, creating an unwinnable situation.<br><br><i>Simon Says</i> is a memory game, where the player must remember a sequence of flashing lights labeled 1 to 5.  Every 4 turns, one more light flashes, creating an increased difficulty level.  The game ends when the player has incorrectly remembered 3 sequences.  ",
