  "description": "<i>Miner</i> is a puzzle and strategy game for multiple systems.  <br><br>It's 1859, just after the fervent rush for gold in California.  All the large veins have been depleted, and the remaining gold lies deep in the ground so that only large mining corporations can hope to extract it.  You still own some claims which seem promising, and your only hope in becoming rich lies in selling your claim to a large corporation.  To convince them to purchase it, you must descend into the earth alone and extract $7000 worth of gold.<br><br>The player can take their elevator shaft down into the earth.  Each piece of earth extracted uses $5 in cash.  There are special areas, which can result in cave-ins, impenetrable rock, sandstone, gold, or flooding springs.  Sandstone offers free digging, and cave-ins cost the player money by forcing them to re-excavate the area.  Springs can flood passageways and mineshafts, forcing the player to dig new routes, or even trap them under ground.  After acquiring gold, it must be brought to the surface and sold at the bank, but the price of gold is often fluctuating.  The game is lost if the player runs out of money, and victory is achieve by acquiring $7000.  <br><br>The player must dig through the earth attempting to find gold <br><br>The player's goal is to reach $7000, and sell their claim to a major mining corporation and retire in luxury.
