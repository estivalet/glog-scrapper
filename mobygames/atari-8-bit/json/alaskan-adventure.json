  "description": "<i>Alaskan Adventure</i> is the nineteenth a series of monthly text adventures for multiple systems.<br><br>You're in Alaska, standing in the snow.  Around you, fifteen treasures are hidden.  Some are buried in the snow, others are cached in nearby igloos.  Some are in even stranger places, and you will need considerable ingenuity to get them.  The player must travel to 8 separate frozen areas via dogsled.  The player's goal is to return all the items to the trading post, and many of the items are found in local snow drifts or stolen from the nearby Inuit community.  Along the way, the player's dogsled team will often break down, requiring the player to feed them, get them water, or treat their illness to continue to the next area.  <br><br>All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.",
