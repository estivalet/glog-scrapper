  "description": "<i>MasterType</i> is an educational game that teaches the player how to type with the keyboard. In the game the MasterType is a powerful wizard who is helping the player defending his command ship by using his laser like force. The command ship is stationed in the center of the screen and from each corner of the screen missiles are launched toward the ship. In each corner of the screen there is a word and by successfully typing in these words the wizard uses his force to zap the missiles. The command ship has four areas and when an area has been hit by a missile it's shield will be destroyed. If the same area is hit a second time the whole ship will explode and the game will be over. <br><br>The game consists of 17 or 18 lessons depending on version and is chosen before the game begins. The first lesson deals with the home row keys (a to ;) and the player only has to enter single letters. As the difficulty increases with each lesson longer and more complex phrases needs to be typed in. Once a lesson is completed the player gets a summary showing how well he has done and whether further practice is needed. Some options exist to alter the game after the player's needs. A beginner mode can be turned on and it's also possible to set a speed goal (number of words per minute). In addition to the lessons included, it is also possible for the player to create his own lessons.",
