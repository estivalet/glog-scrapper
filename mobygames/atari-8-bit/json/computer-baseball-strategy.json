  "description": "<i>Computer Baseball Strategy</i> is an adaptation of Avalon Hill's board game Baseball Strategy. The player is the manager of an unnamed home team and plays single matches against the visitors team that is managed by the computer. When starting out the player first select the team's lineup by picking a pitcher and eight fielders. None of the players are named, all that is shown is a jersey number and some statistics. Once the team has been picked the player gets to select the batting order. When all done the match begins with the player in each inning being in the field in the first half and at bat in the second half. The gameplay works the same in both with the player selecting which pitch or swing to use in each turn. The pitches and swings allowed depends on the pitching ability or batting average of the players.",
