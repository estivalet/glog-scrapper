  "description": "You play as an employee of the Automated Bakery Company, attempting to bake as many cakes as possible.  From a large machine on the bottom left of the screen, a large oven intermittently lets out a puff of smoke and produces a pie crust.  The pie crust travels across the screen to the right on a conveyor belt, and if the pie falls off the end of the belt, it's game over.  <br><br>The player must collect pie filler from the top left of the screen, and place it on the pie on the conveyor belt.  They must then grab cherries, and place those on the pie, and then place the finished pie in the bin on the top right of the screen.  The player scores 1 point for every pie that is completed.  As the game progresses, the conveyor belt moves progressively faster, and obstacles begin to appear in the path of the baker.  Intermittently, creatures will appear whom can interrupt the baker.  ",
