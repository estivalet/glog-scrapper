  "description": "Fifty previously-unreleased games make up this cheap compilation, making for 270K of data on the cassette, perhaps the highest tally ever. All written in BASIC, most are versions of simple arcade games, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Breakout\">Breakout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pacman\">Pacman</a> (Muncher) and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Frogger\">Frogger</a>. Sports are also well represented, with basketball, motor racing and bowls amongst others included. There's also a strategic Star Trek game, Pinball, and Tanks, and Motorway is perhaps the first game in which running over pedestrians is the objective.",
