  "description": "<i>Word Radar</i> is a 1-player word matching game for multiple systems.<br><br>Eight words are briefly displayed in a circle around the periphery of the screen.  These are then covered up, and the line of a radar begins to circle around the screen.  The player attempts to find all 8 words before the line completes a whole rotation.  Incorrect answers speed up the line.  The game tracks correct and incorrect answers over multiple rounds.  ",
