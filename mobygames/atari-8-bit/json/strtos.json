  "description": "The Martian colonies have fallen, and now the M'korg invasion fleet is moving towards the Earth capital, <i>Stratos</i>.  Due to the gravity of the situation, the Prime Admonishment has has been rescinded, and the use of the Armageddon Wave Device has been authorized to protect the city.  M'korg Starjammers will appear in a trinity of terror, and unleash their terrible Atomic Core Disruptors upon the city.  The protective force envelope surrounding the city can't endure this onslaught for long, so you must use the Armageddon Wave Device to slow down the invading forces while the special repair saucer attempts to strengthen the shields.<br><br>The player controls a cross-hair on a fixed screen.  There is a novice and expert difficulty level. Above the city of Stratos 3 enemy ships will briefly appear, and fire upon the city beneath.  The player must destroy them as quickly as possible, as each round will cause further damage to the protective shield.  There are a total of 7 different ships with different movement patterns.  After a brief assault, the player enters repair mode, and can repair holes in the protective shield.  Intermittently meteor storms will occur.  M'korg ships will vacate during this time, and the player can shoot meteoroids for bonus points.  Players are rewarded points based upon how many ships they destroy.  When the overlying shield is eliminated, the city will be destroyed, and it's game over.    ",
