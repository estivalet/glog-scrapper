  "description": "<i>Space Shuttle: Module One</i> is a 1-player space shuttle simulation for the Atari 8-bit.<br><br>The player can try to complete an entire spaceflight, including launch to achieve orbit, descent, and touchdown, or can attempt 1 of these 3 components as a training mission.  During launch and touchdown, the player controls the shuttle's pitch and roll, while in the descent phase the player only controls the pitch.  During launch and landing, the player plays from a first person perspective within the cockpit, and has a throttle, range finder, altimeter, indicator panel, and clock to help their mission.  The descent phase is player from a side view, and the player most carefully maintain their shuttle within the glide path to avoid their shuttle being lost.",
