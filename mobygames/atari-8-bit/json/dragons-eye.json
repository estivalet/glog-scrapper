  "description": "<i>Dragon's Eye</i> is a fantasy RPG in which you are cast as a valiant warrior tasked with saving the lands by completing an epic quest. The lands in question are the &quot;Seven Provinces&quot; and the quest itself involves finding and retrieving the &quot;Dragon's Eye&quot; amulet before its evil power corrupts the entire countryside.<br><br>The game is played from a strategic map view from which you select which area to adventure into, rest and make your necessary equipment purchases. After that it's off to explore the realm and battle all enemies you might encounter from a side view perspective. Battles are turn-based and you can issue several different orders to be carried out in queue when your turn ends. You can explore the land as you see fit, but beware the time limit imposed by the Dragon's Eye.",
