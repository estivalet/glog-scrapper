  "description": "<i>Deluxe Invaders</i> is a 1 - 2 player space-themed arcade game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>Based upon <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=space+invaders\">Space Invaders</a></i>, the player controls a small ship which can move horizontally left and right, and fire vertically.  There are 3 defensive shields which can block the aliens' or player's shots.  The player's goal is to shoot all alien vessels on the screen, but as the player destroys enemies, the speed of ship movement increases, increasing difficulty.  Alien saucers arrive and supply more combatants if they are not shot down.  On later levels, invaders split in two when shot, and both craft must be destroyed independently.  The player starts with 3 lives, but it's game over if all lives are lost or if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.  The player gains an extra life every 10,000 points.  The player can start at any of 9 difficulty levels, and each stage is progressively more difficult.  ",
