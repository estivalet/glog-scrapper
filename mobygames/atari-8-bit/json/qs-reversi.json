The player can only place a piece where there are opposing pieces between their own and the piece laid down, and only legal moves are permitted.  The player receives all pieces between the two pieces of the same color.  When the entire 8x8 board is filled, the player with the most pieces is victorious.  Pieces can be placed through tournament notation by writing the x, y coordinates, or by selecting the location on the board with the keyboard.  Contains 12 levels of computer opponent difficulty.  Players have the ability to undo and redo moves, as well as adding handicap for players.",
