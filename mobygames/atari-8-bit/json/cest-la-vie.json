  "description": "Jacques needs to gather ten, twenty, and fifty dollar bills scattered around the streets of New York before time runs out. He must also be on the lookout for muggers and tax collectors that prowl the streets in search of victims. If one of them catches Jacques, they will pursue him relentlessly until he is caught. Once Jacques is caught, a tax collector will steal 50% of his earnings, and a mugger will steal all of it. Crashing into walls will cause Jacques to end up in a hospital for treatment and also cause him to get slapped with a $200 bill. <br><br>After he makes enough money, he can deposit his cash safely into the bank. Alternatively, Jacques can buy or sell shares at Wall Street, but how much stock he gets depends on the current state of the stock market. If Jacques runs out of money, he can get a loan of up to $10,000, and he is given two months to pay back the loan. If Jacques fails to pay back the loan within two months, then the loan shark Ed will send one of his goons to seek Jacques out and relieve him of his cash, as well as put him in a hospital. The idea is for Jacques to get as rich as he can.\n",
