  "description": "<i>The Bermuda Experience</i> is a fantasy adventure for the Atari 400/800.<br><br>Played from a top-down scrolling point of view, the player controls the <i>SS Nemesis</i>, which must explore the secrets of the Bermuda Triangle, and safely navigate a number of time zones and mysteries.  The player starts in contemporary times, and can explore the islands of the Caribbean.  The player has limited fuel, weapons, and food, but can resupply by visiting some of the islands.  The player will encounter enemies, and are warned repeatedly as they approach.  As the player travels to the east, they encounter a mysterious storm, and then time warps.  As the player enters a time warp, they must explore the new zone for a way to return home.  Zones include pre-historic times, pirate times, and a maze controlled by the mysterious Guardian.  As the player completes each zone, they are transported back to contemporary times.  Each time, the player can travel further to the east, until they eventually encounter and complete all 4 time warps.<br><br>The game contains a combat system, and the player is warned when enemies are nearby. Monsters present on the map will move incessantly towards the player. When the player is engaged, they can choose 3 types of attack: launch a shell, fire a torpedo, or shoot a ground to air missile.  Only one type of attack will be effective on a specific opponent, killing it instantly.",
