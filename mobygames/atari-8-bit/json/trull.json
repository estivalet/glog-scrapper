  "description": "<i>Trull</i> is an action-arcade game, resembling the two popular games Snake and Pac-Man.<br><br>You play as the snake Trull, who is in a maze full of food. To get out of each maze Trull has to eat all the dots, but can also eat apples for bonus points. Dots will give 10 points and apples 100.\nDepending on the difficulty level you have set (10 are available), Trull gets longer with each dot or apple it eats. The higher the difficulty level the longer Trull gets.<br><br>The player has to be very careful not to eat a poisonous mushroom, walk into itself, and pay attention to the time.",
