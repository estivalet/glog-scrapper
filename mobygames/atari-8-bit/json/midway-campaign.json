  "description": "<i>Midway Campaign</i> is a computer simulation of the Battle of Midway Island in June 1942, arguably one of the most decisive battles in the history of warfare. The computer controls a huge force of Japanese ships whose objective is to invade and capture Midway Island. You command the badly outnumbered and outranged American forces with your only advantage being the element of surprise. The game ends if either all of one side's Aircraft Carriers are sunk, or any part of Japanese TF exits map to west or US TF exits map to east with no airstrikes in the air. At the end of the game a summary of all carrier damage, aircraft losses, and victory points from other targets and the Midway invasion are output followed by an evaluation of results.",
