  "description": "<i>Spider Quake</i> is an arcade action game.<br><br>The player controls Eddie Eight Legs, a spider who must survive the threatening dangers and perils of the blazing countryside on his journey to Spider Mountain.  <br><br>Similar to the arcade game <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Frogger\">Frogger</a></i>, the player starts on the bottom of the screen with a spider that can move in all directions.  The player must avoid the dangers of a busy highway, by moving precariously between cars.  They must then avoid unsteady trashbins, and cross on logs across a fast flowing river, to ultimately enter a small cave at the top left of the map.  As the player moves, the map is constantly shifting.  Flies buzz around the screen, which can be picked up for bonus points.  The player has three lives per game, and it's over when these are lost.",
