  "description": "<i>Speedway Blast</i> is 1 - 2 player an arcade driving game for the Atari 400/800.<br><br>The neighborhood has been invaded by asphalt eating monsters, and total chaos is about to ensue.  You hop into your speedster to blast these creatures, but beware of dangers including monster eggs ready to hatch and holes in the concrete.  You must rid your town of these monsters and save your community.  <br><br>The player drives a small vehicle which can move in the 4 cardinal direction, but can only turn 90 degrees at a time.  The vehicle has 2 separate speeds. You also have a small cannon which can fire forwards to destroy monsters.   The game is played in a small town, which loops to the north and sound.  The player has limited fuel, but will gain more when they lose a life or destroy monster eggs.  A small map shows the location of all monsters eggs prior to hatching, and the resultant monster.  The goal is to destroy all these creatures, to advance to a more challenging stage where fuel depletes more quickly.  <br><br>If they player strikes buildings, trees, or monsters, they lose a life.  3 lives lost, and it's game over.  A bonus car is awarded every 10,000 points.  ",
