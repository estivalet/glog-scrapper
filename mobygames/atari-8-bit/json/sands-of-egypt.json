Life as a great explorer has its excitement of recovering precious gems and gold trinkets, but currently you are hopelessly lost in the middle of nothing but sand. You will need to avoid dangerous snakes and cliffs, and find water before dying of thirst. <br><br>This graphical interactive fiction game uses standard single-letter directions - N, S, E, W - for movement.
