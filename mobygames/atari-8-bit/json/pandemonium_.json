  "description": " <i>Pandemonium</i> is a side scrolling action game. The player controls an owl which must safely go through a cave full of obstacles, such as stalactites and stalagmites, dangling vines or winging stars. The contact with any part of the bird with each obstacle means a loss of energy. The player may use temporary immortality in order to avoid the cost of contact with an obstacle. The owl moves at a steady pace to the right, the player can only move it in each direction within its current location.",
