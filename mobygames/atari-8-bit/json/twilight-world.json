  "description": "Twilight World is a platform game set in a dungeon. The aim is to reach the exit of each of eleven levels, while collecting crystals, keys for opening doors, and avoiding roving monsters or other obstacles. Contact with monsters results in your health-bar depleting, and when it is reduced to zero, then you lose a life. Extra lives are gained by exiting a dungeon, collecting 30 gems, or collecting all of the gems in a level. Energy can be replenished by collecting food items.<br><br>The player can walk left or right, or can fire a laser weapon which has a limited range. The player also has a gravity pod, activated by moving &quot;up&quot;. This allows the players to jump any distance from a standing position, including between levels of the dungeon. Moving between levels causes all of the monsters to re-spawn. The player can duck by pressing down. Once per level, the player can activate a short-lived invulnerability mode, which also allows the player to fly (effectively using the gravity pod, while in mid-jump) and kill monsters on contact for about 10 seconds.<br><br>The game has two difficulty levels. The harder level requires all gems to be collected before leaving the dungeon. ",
