  "description": "<i>MiGs and Messerschmitts</i> is part of the <i>Squadron Leader</i> series of air combat strategy games released by Discovery Games in the early eighties. Set on the Eastern Front of World War II in Europe, the game depicts air battles between Russian and German forces during the siege of Leningrad in 1941. The turn-based action of this single-player strategy game is viewed from a side-view perspective, which makes the altitudes of the opposing aircraft a major factor. A number of historical fighters and bombers are simulated. Interesting aircraft include the American Brewster B-239 Buffalo, flown by Finnish forces who were allied with the Germans, and the German Me-262 jet fighter. Historically the Me-262 entered service well after the siege of Leningrad, but it was included to offer an interesting &quot;what if&quot; option.",
