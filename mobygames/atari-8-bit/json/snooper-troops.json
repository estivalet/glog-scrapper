  "description": "The first in a series of 'edutainment' titles long before the portmanteau term was popularized by marketing executives, Snooper Troops had younger players trying to solve the mystery of &quot;The Granite Point Ghost&quot;, an entity that is trying to scare the Kim family out of their new home.<br><br>Using the SnoopNet computer, players will comb the streets of the neighborhood looking for clues, and investigating people's houses while they're away.  Speed is of the essence, as if your Snooper Troop is caught when the owner of the house returns home, you could be thrown off the case for good!<br><br>The title encourages players to keep facts on people, map the neighborhood, review clues, receive special messages, and ultimately, find enough information to accuse and convict the criminal trying to chase the Kim family out their home.",
