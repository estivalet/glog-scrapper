  "description": "<i>Can't Quit</i> is a 1 - 2 player gambling game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>The goal of this game is to move your playing piece from the left to the right on 3 or 4 rows of the game board. The game board is designed in a hexagon with rows numbered 2 to 12.   Rows 2 and 12 have 5 spaces, rows 3 and 11 have 7 spaces, all the way to row 7 which has 15 spaces.  The player rolls 4 dice, and the player can chose whichever 2 rows contains a sum of 2 of the dice rolled. Depending on the rows chosen, the playing pieces will march one space to the right, or 2 spaces if a double is chosen.  On the first rolls, the player chooses the 3 or 4 rows that will be their goal to move a piece all the way to the right.  The player can chose to quit after any roll, and forfeit the next turns to their opponent.  If the player rolls a dice combination that does not allow them to progress on their chosen rows, then that player loses all progress during their recent turns.  The goal is to take a number of spaces, but not to be too greedy and lose all progress.  The first player to march across their 3 or 4 chosen rows is the victor.  ",
