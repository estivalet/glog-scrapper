  "description": "<i>Winged Samurai</i> is a 1-player text-based strategy game of aerial combat.<br><br>It is the spring of 1942.  As the powerful Japanese Imperial fleets make their way across the Pacific, Rabaul Harbor has become the most important base on route to Australia.  As a commander in the Imperial Japanese Air Force based in Rabaul, you are responsible for defense of the airbase and ships from raiding aircraft and carriers in New Guinea.  You will need to outmaneuver British and American escort aircraft and long range fighters to destroy the incoming bomber raids to protect Rabaul.<br><br>Played via text input, the player controls 16 Japanese fighters, which must combat a contingent of oncoming British and American fighters and bombers.  The screen displays the altitude and location of each squadron.  The player can fly toward or away from oncoming fighters or bombers, as well as control the ascent or descent of their plane.  Player and enemy planes take turns moving, and the player can engage fighters or bombers.  The Japanese aircraft have superior speed and acceleration, but are vulnerable to dogfights with enemy fighters, which if sufficiently damage the Japanese planes, will leave them unable to combat the true threat of the bombers.  The player is victorious if the bombers are destroyed before reaching Rabaul.",
