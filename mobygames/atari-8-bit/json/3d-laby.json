  "description": "<i>3D-Laby</i> is a first-person maze game where the player is placed inside a randomly-generated maze and must find the exit (the wall marked with the letter &quot;A&quot;). The player can move from one square to another and make 90 degree turns. It's possible to bring up an overhead map of the entire maze at any time, by pressing Fire. Once the exit is found, the game congratulates the player and tells him how many steps he needed. ",
