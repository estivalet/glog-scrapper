  "description": "You are the pilot of a spacecraft flying over the surface of an alien planet when you realise your fuel is low and an emergency landing is needed. Problem is, the only place to land is a city so the solution is to bomb all the buildings to make a landing strip. The game is viewed from the side on a single screen where you fly from left to right, and when you reach the edge of the screen, you appear one place lower on the left side. You must drop bombs from your craft to remove each building and there a short delay between dropping bombs. If you remove the city then you move to the next level but if you hit a building then it is game over.",
