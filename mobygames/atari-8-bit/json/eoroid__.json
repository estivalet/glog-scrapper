  "description": "<i>Eoroid</i> is a puzzle game, a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Eoroid\">the Commodore 64 game of the same name</a>. Each level is played on a 19x9 board, with some of the squares having blocks on them and others being empty. When the player selects a board square, its state changes, and so does the state of the eight squares surrounding it, similarly to a &quot;Lights Out&quot; puzzle. The goal is to remove all the blocks. ",
