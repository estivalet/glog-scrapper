  "description": "<i>Sea Bandit</i> is an arcade action game where you challenge the mysterious forces of the vast, dark ocean as you search for and capture glittering lost treasures.<br><br>The player's goal is to capture as many undersea jewels as possible during a limited time frame.  A white treasure energizer, or bouncing ball, moves about the screen collecting points and eliminating blocks as it hits waves and jewels.  The player controls a probe which can be raised, lowered, and moved laterally to help direct the energizer.  The probe can be destroyed by being struck by a mine.  The player also controls a minesweep, represented by a red object at the top of the screen, which can be moved laterally.  If the energizer hits the minesweep, it is destroyed, and the player has a total of 5 energizers per game.  Intermittently mines will raise from the ocean depths, and if these are captured by the minesweep, the player will gain bonus time to capture jewels.  The game is over when time runs out or all energizers are lost.",
