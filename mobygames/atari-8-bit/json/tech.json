  "description": "<i>Tech</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Light+Cycle+games\">'Light Cycle' game </a> for two human players. The good one is the lord of the system and the evil one - the Tech program. The aim depends on the selected side - defending the world against viruses or takeover of the entire IT infrastructure. Each player drives around the board leaving a solid trail behind. The collision with the trail or the board edge means a loss of the game.",
