The character health is displayed in the top left of the screen, and if they touch an enemy, an obstacle, or move to a different screen, the health decreases.  As the player explores different screens, they try to locate the sword, wand, cup, and pentacle.  After obtaining all 4 items, they can leave the level via the northern gate.
