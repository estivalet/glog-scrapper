  "description": "<i>American Poker</i> is a card video game written in Basic, based on American Novomatic Poker®. You make separate bets (10 up to 100) on the deal and draw. You receive your initial 5 cards and can form automatic wins on the deal. You can either choose to take a win, or refuse the win and hold specific cards while placing an extra wager. After receiving your hand, you have two options: hold cards and make an extra bet during the draw round, or deal without betting. Once the round is over, you can start a new hand by clicking the deal button. The stake for the card arrangement is displayed in the table. The game ends after losing all the money.",
