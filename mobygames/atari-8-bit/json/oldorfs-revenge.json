The player can choose from a total of 7 different classes, including: Cleric, Thief, Gladiator, Elf, Strongman, Magician, and Wizard. The player must change between different classes as they explore Oldorf's cavern, as different characters have different abilities. The player must explore a total of 100 individual locations, as they try to score 300 points by finding treasures within the caverns.  <br><br>The player can switch between the 7 characters during game play, but each character can only be chosen 5 times.
