  "description": "<p>You are making your way through the murky depths of the mine shaft when you hear a disturbing sound. Paying no attention it, you step forward. However, in an instance you are completely taken aback as you look behind and see a blazing fireball speeding in your direction. In a splash second, you perform a huge leap towards an opening in the wall. „Phew“, you think to yourself, „that was close!“.</p> \n<p>Alien Hell is a top-down survival adventure game which stars a desperate human trapped on the planet Sol III. Inhabited originally by humans, this planet has been gradually taken over by an alien race to exploit the resources of the planet. Because of the harmful effect of the raw materials on aliens, the strange race has decided to use human labour for extraction instead. One day the force field that protects our hero’s jailcell begins to malfunction, and the man dashes toward the exit. That is only the beginning of the nightmare that awaits him.</p>\n<p>The protagonist of Alien Hell has no weapons and the only way to survive is to run. Alien guards, fireballs and toxic gas are some of the many things that the player has to avoid. Crystals can be found in certain places, however their utility is up for the player to figure out. There is a choice of difficulty level in the beginning of the game. Harder difficulty levels increase the agility of the enemy aliens and the velocity of many natural hazards. To finish the game, the player has to find his way out of the labyrinth.</p>",
