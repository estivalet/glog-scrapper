  "description": "The year is 2048, and gladiatorial combat has made a come-back. Floyd the Droid has been chosen as the champion, and must fight hordes of enemies for the amusement of the populace. He is armed with photon missiles, and a protective shield which will annihilate enemies that touch it, at the cost of some energy. You control Floyd, and must survive combat against an infinite wave of enemies for as long as possible, until your energy runs out.<br><br>There are minor differences between the 8-bit and ST versions of the game. In the 8-bit version, enemies flash across the screen either vertically or horizontally, and disappear before appearing again from a random location. Energy is replenished by coming in contact with hearts. The ST version of the game has added digital voice samples and the enemies remain on screen and randomly ricochet from the edges, possibly diagonally. Strength is regained by collecting Atari symbols instead of hearts. Both ports of the game were later re-released by Bug Byte under the title &quot;Missing... One Droid&quot;",
