They must commandeer Sinbad's ship to sail to Roxor's island.  There, they find the mythical Roc, and can acquire a piece of its shell.  Having acquired the shell, Roxor curses the player, putting many mythical creatures in their path on the return trip.  The player must defeat a cyclops, a genie, a giant snake, and other mythical creatures before returning the Roc shell to the princess and winning her hand in marriage.  \n \nAll commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. Unusual to Softside adventures, there is a save and restore feature.",
