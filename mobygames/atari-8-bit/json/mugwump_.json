  "description": "<i>Mugwump</i> is a 1-player strategy game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>You've been mugwump hunting all weekend.  It's damp and cold in this swamp, but at last you have four of the critters cornered.  They are hiding in a 10 x 10 swamp, and each turn you search one location in the swamp, and are informed the distance you are from all 4 creatures.  Using this information, you must try to catch all the mugwumps in 10 turns or less.<br><br>",
