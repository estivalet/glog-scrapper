  "description": "<i>Curse of the Lost Miner</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/caverns-of-the-lost-miner\">Caverns of the Lost Miner</a>, featuring more diverse cave graphics and updated sound and music. General gameplay remains the same. Once again the player controls a smiling head through a total of thirteen, increasingly difficult caves, which each consist of a single screen. Each cave contains several diamonds. Once all diamonds are collected the player reaches the next cave. The gameplay is heavily influenced by Manic Miner. A life is lost if the player hits deadly objects / surfaces or falls down from high platforms.",
