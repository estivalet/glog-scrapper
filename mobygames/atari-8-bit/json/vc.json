  "description": "<i>VC</i> (Viet Cong) is a distinctive simulation which puts the player in a position to manage both military pacification forces and the public civilian political climate.  Your task is to manage a Province with ARV (Army of the Republic of South Vietnam) forces along with U.S. Air Calvary and U.S. Field Artillery Battalions.  The NVA (North Vietnamese Army) and VC controlled by the computer will make this guerrilla/terrorist warfare difficult and try to turn the civilian population against you.  Your goal will be to destroy all enemy forces while preventing half of the civilians you are here to protect from joining forces with the NVA and VC.  This must be accomplished in turn based fashion of one week per turn.",
