  "description": "<em>Cosmic Balance II</em> is a game of strategic galactic conquest, with four skill levels as well as a player-versus-player mode. It plays like a prototype <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=4X+Games\">4X game</a>, with the emphasis on eXploit and eXterminate. The player must take control of 16 sectors by moving ships into place and surviving combat. Building and researching new ships is also vital.<br><br>There are 5 scenarios, increasing in scale and with different goals. 'Terran Expansion' involves setting up a self-sufficient network of planets in a peaceful setting, and 'Colonial Wars' sees them fighting for independence from Earth, introducing combat elements. 'First Contact' involves the earliest violent contact with rivals known as The Empire, while this battle continues in 'Rebellion', which also features other Terrans fighting against you as a third side. The Final Conflict is the biggest battle, with both the Empire and Terran sides starting with equal resources.<br><br>The programme also has the ability for players to design their own scenarios. Ship-to-ship combat can be resolved by the computer, or the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/cosmic-balance\">The Cosmic Balance</a> can be used for tactical combat.",
