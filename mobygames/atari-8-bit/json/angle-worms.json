  "description": "<i>Angle Worms</i> is a two-player arcade game.<br><br>Both players control a continuously moving and elongating worm.   The two players compete on a screen with multiple obstacles to see who can grow the longest worm.  If the player comes in contact with an obstacle or a piece of an elongating worm, they lose the match.  The longer a player survives, the more points they get for winning that match. Each player gets a limited number of shots, which can be used to shorten a worm if they cut off their own tail.  The games ends when one player reaches the predetermined score at the beginning of the match.  ",
