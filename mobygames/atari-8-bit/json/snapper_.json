  "description": "<i>The Snapper</i> is a 1 or 2-player arcade maze game.<br><br>The player controls the arrow-like Snapper, which follows a series of purple dotted lines.  The goal is to collect a specific number of blots on each stage before returning to one of the 4 bases.  On early stages, no blots are required, but as difficulty progresses, more blots are required to complete a level.  The player always starts in the middle of the stage, and must avoid the flashing Gamma Field which flits around the screen.  In addition, Whirlers follow the purple lines, but destroy the trail behind them, constantly changing the maze.  The player loses a life if they contact a Whirler or Gamma Field.  There are also thickened blue lines, which allow the player to move at double speed, but they can not exit from the blue line until reaching the end.<br><br>The Snapper is armed with a shield, which temporarily makes the player invulnerable.  The player has a maximum of 3 shields, and these are replenished at a rate of one per round.  After consuming a set number of blots, a ring appears in the middle of the screen.  This will reset the maze to a pristine state, undoing the Whirler's damage.  It will also multiple your score, and a new Snapper is earned for every 5 rings collected. Each level is timed, and the player loses a life if they don't complete a stage in time.  The player starts with 3 snappers, and when all are lost it's game over.  ",
