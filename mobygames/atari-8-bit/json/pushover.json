  "description": "<i>Pushover</i> is a 1 - 2 player puzzle game for the Atari 8-bit computer. <br><br>You're locked in a life-or-death struggle with your opponent high atop a two-sided cliff.  As quickly as possible, you must interpret three or more command symbols.  The player must as quickly as possible respond to the command with the joystick.  Options include: arrows, numbers, letters, and a mix of these.  When a player makes a correct answer, they push their opponent closer to the edge.  When a player loses 3 rounds, it's game over.  \n",
