  "description": "<i>Black Hole Adventure</i> is the seventh in a series of monthly text adventures for multiple systems.<br><br>As captain of the interstellar craft Palomino, returning from a long journey, you find yourself face to face with a gigantic black hole.  Moving closer, you find something even more unique - a ship sitting on the vortex's edge, unaffected by the immense gravity.  It is Deep-Space One, the Cygnus, humanity's most illustrious undertaking.  <br><br>Decades earlier, the Cygnus' designer and captain Dr. Hans Reinhardt, conned the International Space Appropriations Agency into funding this giant project.  Then, after years of failure, the ship did not respond to a command to return to Earth.  The ship was assumed lost, and its crew presumed dead. <br><br>As the Palomino makes a pass over the vessel, the silent, dead apparition suddenly springs to life!  Lights go on all over the Cygnus; her docking bay beckons to the smaller ship.  The Palomino lands, and you step onto the legacy of a ship of robots, a ship controlled by its only human survivor, Dr. Hans Reinhardt.<br><br>The player must explore the Deep-Space One, and avoid the lobotomized crew that have been turned into mindless robots.  These robots can sometimes trap the players in a room and kill them, unless the player has a gun with limited supply ammunition to defend themselves.   The player can collect Old Bob, and parts and fuel to repair the Cygnus to escape back to Earth.  <br><br>The player can encounter the evil robot Maximilian and Dr. Reinhardt aboard the bridge of the vessel.  There are two alternative endings, where the player can escape through the black hole, or can blast off to a new world to start a new life.  <br><br>All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save or restore feature.",
