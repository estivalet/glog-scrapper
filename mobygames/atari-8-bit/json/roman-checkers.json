  "description": "<i>Roman Checkers</i> is a computer conversion of the board game Reversi (or Othello as it is also known). It's a two player game where players take turns in putting out stones on a 8x8 grid. One player has black stones and the other has white. For each round the player puts out one stone on the board and will then trap all of the opponent's stones that are enclosed between the player's stones. The opponent's stones will then change colour to the one of the player. The game ends when the board is full and the player with most stones in his colour will win. <br><br>Roman Checkers can be played either human vs. human or human vs. computer. It's controlled with either joystick or keyboard. ",
