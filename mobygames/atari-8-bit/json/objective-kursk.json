  "description": "  Objective: Kursk is a grand-tactical level game covering the Fourth Panzer Army attacks against the Soviet forces on the south flank of the Kursk salient. Each game turn consists of 12 hours of operations. Operations consist of suppling and moving combat forces, changing formation, planning assaults, air strikes, artillery bombardments and resolving air combat situations. The game map covers the battlefields on the south flank of the Kursk salient, from Kursk in the north to Belgorod in the south. Movement around the map is controlled by a hexagon grid system with each hexagon representing three miles. German forces are controlled by the human player and the Soviet forces can be controlled by either computer or human. Forces on both sides are pre-assigned at the beginning of each game. Each opponent will have five phases to prepare for battle and then a combat phase starts after. Game will end on 7-15-43 or you defeat your opponent before that date. Victory points are awarded for the control of towns and for surviving combat forces. ",
