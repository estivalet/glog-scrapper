  "description": "Design your own starships and send them out for combat against the computer player. With limited space for equipment, a ship designer must decide whether to load up the ship with weapons and go for an all-out attack, add shields and deflectors to protect your ship, or use high tech propulsion and run rings around the opponent. Ships can be sized from a corvette class all the way to a massive battlestar. Once complete, you enter combat vs. against a silmilar-sized ship, which also can be you or someone else's design, or a computer generated ship. The computer resolves combat as you watch the ships battle. ",
