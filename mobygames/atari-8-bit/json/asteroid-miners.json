  "description": "<i>Asteroid Miners</i> is a space-themed arcade game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>Your home planet is in dire need of specific resources, which can only be found in an asteroid field in a dangerous realm of space.  The player controls a large mining vessel, and has a limited time span to scoop up the valuable gold and blue asteroids, while avoiding the unstable and worthless white asteroids.  If the player scoops up all asteroids with time remaining, they enter a bonus round on a secondary field, where they try to gather additional resources for bonus points.  There are 3 difficulty levels.  On level 1, asteroids are stable, and time is plentiful.  On the higher levels, new asteroids appear during gameplay, and can damage the mining vessel.  Furthermore, white asteroids might explode on impact with the miner.  ",
