  "description": "You are a space destroyer defending Earth against the Trillians. The Trillians are using attack bases to launch Kamikaze satellites and Trillian fighters at Earth.<br><br>When a satellite or a fighter gets close, your weapon will automatically track their vertical motion. You must track them horizontally and fire at the right time. You lose energy when a fighter shoots you or when a fighter or satellite explodes on Earth. If you see a fighter with a white stripe (the back of the fighter), keep it on the screen for five seconds and you will come to an attack base. Destroy the attack base to regain energy.<br><br>If you lose all your energy, you will explode and the Trillians will celebrate as...<i>The Earth Dies Screaming</i>!",
