  "description": "<i>Ankh</i> is a flick-screen arcade adventure where you control a Mindprobe in the &quot;Metareal&quot; world of Ankh. You have to explore the 64 room world to find a Treasure, Tool or a new mystery in the last room of the world. As you move around you will encounter various objects that move around the screen shooting at you but you are able to shoot back. There are doors that need opening by switches, other treasures to collect and objects that can be used elsewhere to help you in your quest. If you are shot, touch certain objects, touch walls or the doors then an energy bar decreases and when it is empty then it is game over.",
