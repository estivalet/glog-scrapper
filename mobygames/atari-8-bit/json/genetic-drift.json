  "description": "You are surrounded on all 4 sides by genetic mutations.  Positioned in the center of the screen, the player can fire in all 4 cardinal directions to defeat the attacking mutants.  The enemies will throw deadly genetic information at you, which you must shoot down with your lasers.  If you shoot the enemies, they will mutate into harmless televisions, but if you are hit, you lose a life.  Lose three lives, and you will mutate into a television set, and it's game over.<br><br>When you have mutated all enemies in one of the 4 cardinal directions, they will instead fire hearts towards you.  Upside down hearts are deadly if they hit you, but if you shoot a right side up heart, it will cause all mutants in that direction to revert to their original deadly form.  When you have devolved the mutants in all 4 directs, their threat will be neutralized and you can advance to the next stage.  On higher levels, the player encounters more deadly forms of genetic material, such as whirling hunks of critical mass which circle the player.  These must be shot several times to be destroyed.",
