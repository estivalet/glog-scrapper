  "description": "<i>Acey-Deucey</i> is an adaptation of the card game with the same name (also known as In-Between). The game can be played by up to four human players and there is also an option to add an AI controlled player. Each player is presented with two cards with faces up and between them one with the face down. The player then places a bet on whether the value of third card will fall in between the two other cards. If it is the money is won and if not the money is lost. There are two variations of the game: pot game and break the bank. The money in the pot/bank can be chosen by the players. Each player start out with $50 and the minimum amount of the pot/bank is $500.",
