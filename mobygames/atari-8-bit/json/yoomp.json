  "description": "<i>Yoomp!</i> is the winner of the 2007 ABBUC software competition. \nLike a combination of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Trailblazer\">Trailblazer</a> and an often-seen demoscene effect, you fall down a tube, landing on each square progressively in a rhythmic manner. Landing on certain tiles will have certain effects, such as making the screen quake, decreasing the brightness or forcing you to jump. Navigating the tube itself is a matter of planning ahead and compensating for your limited movement capabilities.\nThis game is freeware and can be downloaded on the Yoomp website.",
