The player must choose the jar where the fly is more likely to land on gold. Each jar contains 9 items, either golden circles or green squares. The first player to reach 50 landings is the winner.<br><br>In <i>Chaos</i>, the player moves about a small box, while purple or red items of different shape appear. The player must try to collect pieces that are the same color, shape, or both to the item displayed in the center. The player has 250 seconds, and every 50 seconds the type of item that can be collected changes. If the player collects an incorrect item, it's game over.",
