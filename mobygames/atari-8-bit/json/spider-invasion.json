  "description": "<i>Spider Invasion</i> is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the Atari 8-bit computer.<br><br>You are a spelunker, and on one of your expeditions you hear strange chirping sounds from deep within the earth.  As you plunge deeper, to your amazement it is crawling with deadly spiders of many sizes.  Deadly mutated spiders are plotting the invasion of Earth from deep within their caverns beneath the planet's surface.  Armed with only your photon laser beam, you must destroy the arachnid menace.<br><br>The player controls a small vessel which can move in all directions, but can only fire vertically up and down, depending on the direction the vessel is facing. On each level, there is a limited time, and the player must destroy all eggs, hatched spiders, and the spider's main nest.  Eggs not destroyed quickly will hatch into new spiders, and the player must avoid the walls, as they're covered in deadly spider venom.  The player must beware of the large mother spider, which will streak suddenly across the screen towards the player.  As one level is cleared, an identical in shape, but more dangerous cavern will appear up to level 10.  The player has 5 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over",
