  "description": "<i>RAF: The Battle of Britain</i> is a 1-player text-based strategy game of aerial combat.<br><br>The year is 1940, and the Luftwaffe have been engaging Britain in a battle for air superiority over the English Channel.  As a squadron of German fighters and bombers make their way towards London, the player must attempt to shoot down the heavily guarded bombers before they reach London and heavily damage the city.  <br><br>Played via text input, the player controls 12 British fighters, which must combat a contingent of oncoming German fighters and bombers. The screen displays the altitude and location of each squadron. The player can fly toward or away from oncoming fighters or bombers, as well as control the ascent or descent of their plane. Player and enemy planes take turns moving, and the player can engage fighters or bombers. The British aircraft have superior speed and acceleration, but are vulnerable to dogfights with enemy fighters, which if sufficiently damage the British planes, will leave them unable to combat the true threat of the bombers. The player is victorious if the bombers are destroyed before reaching London.",
