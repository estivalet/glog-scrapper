  "description": "You are the only one left after a bloody alien attack and now with your weapon store emptied and destroyed you have to traverse over five levels of terrain to escape the aliens. Armed with just a gun you must shoot the enemy who are attacking you with your weapons, but you can take cover behind tree's, fences and houses. <i>Gun Law</i> is based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/commando\">Commando</a> as you move vertically up each level. The game is viewed from above at an elevated angle and you use a joystick to control your soldier.",
