  "description": "<i>Herbert</i> is a platform game where two players control ducks and race to be the fastest to a Stall. On their way to the Stall (and eventually to win the heart of their girlfriend), Herbert (P1) and his friend Oscar (P2) encounter bothersome obstacles such as witches, plants, thorns, and sword fighters. And they must also obtain gems to unlock the door to the Stall. But Herbert and Oscar cannot dally long - each level has a maximum time, and if that limit is reached, they're dead ducks (no pun intended)! Luckily, Herbert and Oscar can gain advantages by laying eggs in a nest (to get an extra life) and/or triggering temporary invulnerability.<br><br>There are 20 levels in this game. Best times, as well as high scores, are saved.",
