  "description": "<i>Escape from the Dungeon of the Gods</i> is a text-based adventure game with RPG elements.<br><br>For years, the small medieval town of Alvard was rule by a kind man, King Safius I.  However, after his death, his son Safius II became a harsh ruler, terrorizing the people of Alvard.  You and several other citizens have banded together to rebel against Safius II, but the day before your first attack, the secret police captured you and imprisoned you within the legendary Dungeon of the Gods. You must escape from your prison cell, and find the legendary Chest of the Gods, which has the power to destroy the king and all his forces.<br><br>This is a text-based adventure game, where the player enters all commands via VERB NOUN entries.  The player must solve a number of inventory based puzzles, as they explore the dungeon, and have a limited inventory.  There is no save or restore feature. Various monsters are found at specific locations, which can be defeated in text-based combat.  Combat consists of attacking the enemy, and choosing which weapon to do this. The player does not have hitpoints or statistics, but if they take a number of hits during combat, they are defeated.",
