  "description": "<i>Market Forces</i> is a 1 - 8 player commodities trading simulation and game for multiple systems.<br><br>When you play <i>Market Forces</i>, you can experience the actual effects of a market economy without risking your shirt.  At the beginning of each turn, players are supplied a market analysis, and which commodities might be hot in the future.  Players take turns buying and selling 5 separate commodities: corn, bacon, coffee, orange juice, and sugar.  The player selects the amount of commodity they wish to purchase and how much they are willing to play, but this information is not conveyed to their competitors.  <br><br>The amount of commodity the player actually receives depends upon the number of purchases by their competitors, and the price that they are paying.  If the competitor is willing to pay more, then they will get the entirety of the resource.  If the player purchases more than they can afford, they will rack up debt, and if they can not pay this off, they will declare bankruptcy and lose.  Next comes the selling phase, where players offload the goods they purchased.  Any goods not sold will be lost, as they can not be stored for a year.  The number of units sold once again depends on the player's selling price and that of their competitors, and there is risk the player may not be able to offload their goods if they ask for too much.  <br><br>Gameplay takes place over 6 turns, with the player who has the most money at the end is declared the winner.",
