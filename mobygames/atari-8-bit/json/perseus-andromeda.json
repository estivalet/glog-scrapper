  "description": "<i>Perseus &amp; Andromeda</i> is Number 9 in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mysterious-adventures\">the Mysterious Adventures series</a>. As the title implies, this one involves Greek mythology involving the characters Perseus and Andromeda. Hero Perseus must slay Medusa and rescue Princess Andromeda who will then become his bride. To accomplish this, he must arm himself with a sword, shield and sandals.<br><br>This game follows the Perseus mythology story closely (as seen in the movie &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; for example).  Many puzzles involve giving an object to someone, who then gives Perseus another object. Entering temples and praying can produce plot-advancing events.<br><br>Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously, although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.",
