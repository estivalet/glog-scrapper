  "description": "<i>Stryczek</i> is a word-guessing game for up to two players based on the original paper and pencil Hangman. The game shows a password covered by series of blank spaces. The player's task is to guess the password in a certain number of attempts. Each correct answer gives a point, each wrong answer draws a part of a hanged man. After reaching a certain amount of mistakes the player becomes a hangman and the game ends. In two player mode contestants alternately guess the same password, knowing the letters given by the opponent. Each of them has its own gallows.",
