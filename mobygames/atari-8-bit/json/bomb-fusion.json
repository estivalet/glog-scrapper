  "description": "Terrorists have planted bombs all over the Sellerscale Nuclear Processing Plant and will destroy the Northern Hemisphere if they aren't defused. You play the hero selected for this dangerous mission in this single screen platform game spread over various levels. On each level is a various amount of bombs and when one is nine seconds from exploding then you have to reach it and touch it to reset it before it explodes. If it explodes it will increase a radiation meter on the left of the screen and when it is full you lose one of three lives.<br><br>As you defuse the bombs, fuel capsules are sprayed out by a pipe and a certain number also need collecting and put in a box and you can carry as many capsules as you want. To reach higher platforms you can either use pipes that make you bounce higher or you can fall of the bottom of the screen to appear at the top. Moving about the screen is a ball and if you touch it carrying capsules then you lose them and you also increase the radiation meter. Once you have collected enough capsules and defused a certain amount of bombs then you move to the next level.",
