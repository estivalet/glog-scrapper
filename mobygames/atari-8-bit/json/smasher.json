  "description": "<i>Smasher</i> is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the Atari 8-bit.<br><br>The Vorpons, enemies from a neighboring galaxy, are swarming through your Empire's intergalactic port.  Their goal is to destroy the Empire.  You control the most colossal weapon ever devised- The Smasher. Your job is to crush their tiny craft into oblivion and save the Empire.  <br><br>Some of the enemy ships, Cruisers, command a crack Vorpon suicide squadron, and are filled with super-powerful explosives.  They cruise between the jaws of The Smasher, hoping to deceive the player into crushing them.  <br><br>The Smasher can be moved horizontally, and crusher whatever lies between its two arms.  The goal is to smash all ships that aren't cruisers, to advance to the next level.  The player has limited time to complete each level, as any ship that crosses the screen unsmashed twice allows the aliens to capture a part of the space station.  If the player moves the smasher over a captured area, it is destroyed.   These areas are removed if the corresponding ship is smashed.  Its game over if 3 smashers are lost.  ",
