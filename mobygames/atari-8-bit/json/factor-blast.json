  "description": "<i>Factor Blast</i> is an educational game where two players (or one player versus AI) take turns picking numbers from a grid. The starting player can choose any of the number which is then blasted and removed from the grid. The second player then has pick numbers that are factors of the first player's number. For example if player one picks 25 player two should pick 5. The players' scores then increases with the value of the numbers picked. Penalties can be turned on and then scores will decrease when a factor is missed or the wrong number is picked. The game goes on until there are no more numbers on the board and the player with the highest score wins the game. There are three levels of difficulty which differ in size: 25, 64 or 100 numbers. ",
