  "description": "<i>Rick Hanson</i> is a text adventure in which you play the eponymous character, who is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=James+Bond\">James Bond</a>-style special agent. Your mission in this game is to assassinate a general who is playing a very dangerous game with world politics. As with most text adventures, you type in simple commands, which will be carried out if the programmer has allowed for it. There are two simple substitution ciphers which you will need to solve. The HELP command gives you a list of verbs, but nothing else, unlike more modern examples of this type of game. The versions for BBC/Electron, Amstrad and Atari 400/800 all have slightly different solutions.",
