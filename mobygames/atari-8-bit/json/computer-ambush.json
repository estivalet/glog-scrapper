  "description": "<i>Computer Ambush</i> is a computer tactical simulation of squad vs squad combat in France during World War II. You are a Sergeant and command a squad of 10 infantrymen (either American or German). Each man has a name, personal background (dossier), and comes rated with individual critical combat skills. You can also rate the soldiers to your own specifications for more flexibility. Computer Ambush is played as a series of turns until either one side is destroyed or one or both sides have completed their missions.The game can be played as two player ( 7 scenarios) or computer as opponent (5 scenarios). The game is advanced level and takes 1 -3 hours to complete.<br><br>The 1982 released <i>Second Edition</i> for Apple II, which is also the base for the ports to other computer systems, adds the ability drop/pick up weapons, faster AI turns (about three minutes instead of three hours) and a new graphic for the US flag.",
