  "description": "<i>Chinese Puzzle</i> is a text adventure for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>You just spent the last five days competing as a finalist in the World Cup Pro Am Jigsaw Puzzle Competition.  You've devoted all your waking hours in the past year to to working on puzzles, but your discipline has paid off.  You walk away with the grand prize, an all expenses paid trip to the Orient.  After landing in the Orient, you hail a rickshaw to take you into town.  The driver offers some light refreshment during the short journey.  Gratefully you gulp down the golden liquid, and that's the last thing you remember before you wake up in a dimly lit, paneled room.  It turns out the rickshaw driver was hired by the runner-up, who is sore at losing, and wants a little revenge.  <br><br>The player must navigate a series of colored rooms and mazes to try to escape this trap and reach freedom.  All entries are via VERB NOUN entry, and there are multiple inventory-based puzzles to solve. There is no save/restore feature.",
