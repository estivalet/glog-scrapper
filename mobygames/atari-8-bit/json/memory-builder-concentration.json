  "description": "<i>Memory Builder: Concentration</i> is a version of the concentration/memory card game. It can be played by one player alone, against a second player or against the computer. The game screen contains twenty boxes which hide either words or letters and the aim is to find pairs of these. The game is played by typing in the numbers of two boxes whose words are then revealed. If a successful match is made the words are removed and the player gets another turn. When all boxes have been opened the player with the most matches wins the game. It's possible to play with either words or letters.",
