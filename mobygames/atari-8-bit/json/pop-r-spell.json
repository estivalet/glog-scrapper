  "description": "<i>Pop 'R Spell</i> is a 1 - 4 player competitive word solving game for multiple systems.<br><br>Players attempt to solve an unknown word by filling in the blanks.  Each turn, a player has 30 seconds to either pop or spell.  If the player chooses spell, they attempt to fill in all the blanks and solve the word.  If they attempt to pop, they are presented with 3 letters to choose from, 1 of which appears in the word.  If they choose a letter that has already been chosen or is not in the word, they lose points.  If they are successful, they gain. Players can pass their turn without losing points. The points value for each letter is different, with uncommon letters such as Z, Q, and X being worth more points.  When solving a word, the player receives the point value of each letter typed, plus 5 more points per letter. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points, and there are 6 levels of word challenge.<br><br>",
