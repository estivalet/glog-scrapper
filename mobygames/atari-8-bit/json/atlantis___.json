  "description": "<i>Atlantis</i> is the fourth of Softside Magazine's Adventure of the Month published for multiple systems.<br><br>While exploring beneath the ocean in search of Atlantis, you discover a giant plastic dome stretching for miles.  As you enter the domed city, you are captured and thrown in prison.  From your jail cell, you learn that Prince Retep has created four neutron bombs which he intends to launch to the Earth's surface, neutralizing all surface life, and leaving the planet habitable to Merfolk.  The player must escape from jail, and impersonate the Atlanteans.  Then, they must gather a number of keys, confronting Prince Retep at the controls of the neutron missiles.  Shooting Retep dead, the player must deactivate the launch, and then escape back to the surface world.  <br><br>All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.",
