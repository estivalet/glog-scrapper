  "description": "Billed as &quot;the greatest adventures in history,&quot; this game was actually two games in one: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/return-of-heracles\">The Return of Heracles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/ali-baba-and-the-forty-thieves\">Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</a>.<br><br>Both games are somewhat similarly constructed, as they were built on an engine that is a precursor to Stuart Smith's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Adventure+Construction+Set\">Adventure Construction Set</a>. Control multiple characters via a top-down perspective on various quests throughout the mythological past. Find items, increase your stats, battle monsters, and explore the land in these turn-based RPGs.<br><br>Both games feature a cooperative component that lets any number of players play together, simply by dividing up the available characters.",
