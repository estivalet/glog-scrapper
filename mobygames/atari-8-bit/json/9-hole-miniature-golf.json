  "description": "A BASIC adaptation of miniature golf for 1 to 10 human players, courtesy of SoftSide magazine.  9 holes are played in sequence, with a top-down view of the course, and each player in turn attempts to complete a hole.  A shot is performed by positioning the putter at an angle and selecting a swing force from 1 to 9; each hole has a pre-determined par - the player's number of strokes minus the par determines the score, so (as in standard golf) lower scores are better.",
