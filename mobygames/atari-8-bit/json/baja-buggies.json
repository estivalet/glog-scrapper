  "description": "A simple race game simulating off-road buggy racing in the Baja California desert. The game uses pseudo-3D perspective and behind-the-car view. As opposed to most of the racing games of the period, collisions with other buggies cause slowdowns rather than crashes. Other notable features include a speedometer and a race progress indicator. <br><br>From the technical perspective, the game uses Display List Interrupts (DLIs) to create multicolor horizon and 3D-road effects.
