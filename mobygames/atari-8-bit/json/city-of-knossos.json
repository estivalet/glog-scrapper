  "description": "<i>The City of Knossos</i> is a 1-player maze game for the TRS-80.<br><br>Played from a 1st person perspective, the player is randomly placed in a 20 x 20 maze along with the Minotaur of Knossos.  The Minotaur will move towards the player, and if it catches them it is game over.  Hidden somewhere in the map is a single space which the player can walk through, which allows exit from the maze.  The top of the screen displays the distance to the Minotaur and the distance to the exit.  The player is armed with chalk, which can mark wall segments to help the player navigate the maze.  The player can choose a randomized or a fixed map, and the goal is to escape the maze before being caught by the Minotaur.  There are 3 levels of Minotaur speed and chalk availability.",
