  "description": "<i>Thunder Island</i> is a 1 - 2 player maze game for the Atari 400/800.<br><br>Somewhere in the South Pacific, about a thousand miles off the coast of New Zealand, lies an island that contains the world's only transparent maze.  This maze can be manipulated into an endless variation of different paths and puzzles.  Unfortunately, this area is subject to sudden storms , which can plunge the maze into darkness.  Armed with only a small lantern, you must navigate this maze racing a timer or another player.  <br><br>The player controls a small square, which must navigate a large maze.  At the beginning of each stage, the maze is displayed for the player to try to remember its design.  The player is then plunged into darkness, with only a small adjacent section of the maze illuminated.  In 1-player games, the player races against time, while in a 2-player game, both players race simultaneously through the randomly generated map.  The goal is to travel from the top left corner of the map to the exit on the bottom right.  ",
