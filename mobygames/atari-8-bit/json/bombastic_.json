  "description": "<i>Bombastic!</i> is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>Each player controls a character on either side of the screen, and move vertically and fires towards the opposite side of the screen.  Small bombs bounce about the screen, which can be pushed towards the opposite side of the screen by shooting them.  After bombs are shot several times, they become angry, and will damage the protective shield if they crash into either side.  If the shield is sufficiently damaged, that player loses.   There are 9 different modes of level arrangement.",
