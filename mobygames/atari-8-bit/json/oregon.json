  "description": "The original, non-graphical BASIC version of <i>The Oregon Trail</i> was first developed in 1971 by three Minnesotan teachers and meant to be played on a Teletype. This first version was played exclusively by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,580420/\">Don Rawitsch's</a> history class, taught at Carleton College. A subsequent version was re-typed from paper records into MECC computer systems in 1974, and made available to school systems across the entire state. It would be revised in 1976 and again in 1978 based on new research. In 1979-1980, MECC released Elementary Volume 6 for the Apple II microcomputer, a bundle of educational software including &quot;Oregon&quot; with music, rudimentary, non-animated graphics, and action-based shooting sequences. Subsequent versions for Atari, Commodore 64, and Radio Shack computers followed.<br><br>Being designed for a Teletype, gameplay is comparatively simpler than in the more widely played 1985 version. Players do not name or manage the members of their party; only the leader counts, and the game is over if he/she dies. Every day, the player may choose whether to hunt or not, and how well to eat. To hunt, the player must type a word such as &quot;BANG&quot; as quickly as possible when prompted, and is rewarded with food if typed correctly and fast enough. A disaster may occur randomly each day, such as raiders attacking or poor weather, and sometimes the player must choose from a menu which action to take in response.",
