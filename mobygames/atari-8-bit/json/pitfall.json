  "description": "<i>Pitfall!</i> is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck, you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens if you can live that long!",
