  "description": "This game is a 2D shooter. You have to destroy the enemy's Magnet Power Station with your gun. There are only a few moments before the atomic turbine missile encounters the enemy. As a pilot of a space fighter you have to shoot your way through waves of aliens. You can escape the danger by using warps and special objects - to be collected en route. The aliens will mutate into more dangerous forms the longer they live so don't let the aliens survive.",
