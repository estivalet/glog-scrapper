  "description": "In <i>Treasure Quest</i>, the year is 1760, and you are captain of the pirate ship Zombie.  You have sailed to the Blood Straights, with the goal of finding a great treasure, either buried at land or sea.  The player will encounter shipwrecks and other pirate crews as they explore, and must gather vital clues to the location of the hidden treasure.  The treasure must be found before hurricane season begins, or the ship and all crew aboard will perish.<br><br>The player can travel by ship or smaller boat.  The player can also disembark on islands and walk.  The player states the direction they wish to travel, and for how many hours.  Ocean depth, tides, and wind direction play vital roles in movement, as the large sailing ship must tack into the wind, and cannot sail directly into the wind. The smaller boat can handle shallower water, and can be rowed in all wind conditions, but is much slower.  As well, the smaller vessel and all crew aboard will perish if caught in a small storm.  No vessel can survive a hurricane.  <br><br>If the player attempts to leave the game play window, they will be sunk by the British navy. The player has a total of 30 days until hurricane season arrives.  ",
