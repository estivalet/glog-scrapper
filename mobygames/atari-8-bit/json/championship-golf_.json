  "description": "<i>Championship Golf</i> is a 1 - 4 player top-down golf simulation.<br><br>The screen is divided into a top-down view of golf course, as well as a horizontal view showing the distance to the green.  Each player can choose their handicap, which determines how far their swing goes.  The player must choose their club, and the strength of their swing from 0 - 10.  The player chooses the direction of their shot from 0 - 360 degrees, and the movement of the ball is graphically displayed on the screen.  When the player lands on the green, gameplay changes to a large green circle representing the screen, and the player must choose the direction and power of their putt.\n",
