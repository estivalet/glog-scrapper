  "description": "Mostly written in Atari BASIC (with a hint of 6502 assembly), this game was <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,202/\">Brian Moriarty</a>'s first text adventure.  Its player controls a private investigator on the trail of extra-terrestrial burglars who have stolen the Declaration of Independence!  There are clues to be found in the &quot;maze of streets&quot; representing Washington D.C. and, of course, there is the upper dimension promised in its title to be traversed with the game's text parser interface.",
