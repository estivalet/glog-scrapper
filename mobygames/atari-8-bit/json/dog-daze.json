  "description": "<i>Dog Daze</i> is a 2-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>Two dogs appear n the screen, each controlled by a different player.  Fire hydrants appear on the screen, and the first player to reach the hydrant makes it that color.  Immediately a new hydrant then appears on the screen.  On the top of the screen is a counter, and for every successfully tagged hydrant, it moves towards that player.  The first person to take control of the counter is the winner.  If the player runs into a hydrant previously tagged by an opponent, they also lose a point, until the screen is almost filled by tagged hydrants.  Each player can throw a bone, and if hits an untagged hydrant, the player gains the point.  If the bone misses, it needs to be collected before it can be thrown again.  At the end of a timed section, a car will begin to come across the screen, and if a dog is hit, it's game over.",
