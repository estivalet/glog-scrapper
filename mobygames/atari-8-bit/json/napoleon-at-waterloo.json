  "description": "<i>Napoleon at Waterloo</i> is a real-time strategy game which covers the battle of Waterloo (1815).The player controls Napoleon Bonaparte's army and has to defeat the enemy.<br><br>At first glance, the game has the distinctive look of a wargame: a top-down map with abstract symbols representing the terrain and units. However, everything is in real-time and therefore the complexity has been toned down. The only thing the player does is giving move orders by choosing a unit and moving the cursor to the place it should move to. Those orders are not carried out instantly; each movement takes a certain amount of time depending on terrain and unit type. Battles are initiated automatically when a unit moves close to a hostile. Then they basically exchange blows until one unit lost all of its soldiers. The game also factors in fatigue and morale.<br><br>The time is measured with an in-game clock and a match ends after eleven hours (30 minutes in real-time). If the player has won a match depends on the reached score which is based on the casualties.",
