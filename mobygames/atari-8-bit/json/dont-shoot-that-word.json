  "description": "<i>Don't Shoot That Word!</i> is an educational game that plays like a shooting gallery game. A number of words move across the screen and the player has to shoot the correct ones down by hitting a bullseye located above them. There are two variations of the game: reading game and rhyming game. In the reading game the objective is to shoot the words that does not match the image being shown. After a word has been shot the letters will fall down and the player can earn bonus points for shooting them too. In the rhyming game words that match or rhyme with the image should be shot. Shooting the wrong word leads to a life being lost",
