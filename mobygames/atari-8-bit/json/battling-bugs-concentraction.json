  "description": "<i>Battling Bugs &amp; Concentration</i> is a series of two educational games for multiple systems.<br><br>In <i>Battling Bugs</i>, the player has two opposing colors of insects that march towards each other. When the bugs strike each other, opposing colors will eliminate each other. The player must quickly determine how many blue insects must be added or subtracted to equal the number of red bugs, so that in subsequent waves all insects will eliminate each other. The goal is to have no bugs left over on the screen for a score of 100.  Every bug that reaches the opposing edge of the screen is -10 points.<br><br><i>Concentration</i> is a 1-4 player tile matching puzzle, where each puzzle contains a graphical or textual depiction of a fraction.  The player must select two tiles using the letters A - T.  The player must then state whether the fractions are equal or different.  If the player finds two identical fractions, and correctly identifies them as such, they gain points, and the cards are removed.  The player loses points if they incorrectly identify different or same fractions.",
