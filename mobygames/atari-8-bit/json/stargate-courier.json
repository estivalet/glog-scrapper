  "description": "<i>Stargate Courier</i> is a 1-player arcade game for the Atari 8-bit computer.<br><br>The player controls a spaceship which can move in 8 directions and fire directly forwards.  Gameplay occurs in outer space and on an alien planet.  The player has a limited fuel supply, and fuel can only be acquired by landing on these alien planets.  On the alien planets, the screen scrolls vertically from above, and the player can cruise at either high or low altitude, but can only acquire fuel at a low altitude.  At low altitude, dangers including turrets and enemy fighters are present, but there are fewer dangers higher up. After acquiring sufficient fuel, the player can once again enter outer space.  Back in space, the player must destroy a select number of alien fighters as demonstrated in the top right of the screen.  After destroying these, a warp gate opens, which allows the player to progress to the next level.  A compass on the bottom of the screen shows the direction to the fuel planet or warp gate.  <br><br>",
