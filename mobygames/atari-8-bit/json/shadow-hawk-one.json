  "description": "<i>Shadow Hawk One</i> is a first person space shooter and strategy game.<br><br>The Galactic Empire has just conquered the Noble Free Space Confederation, except for a remote moon on the outskirts of the empire.  Using your warship's unmatched speed, you prey on the Galactic Empire's merchant fleet to gather raw materials to better your ship's weaponry, shielding, and missiles.  Your goal is to sack the Galactic Empire's merchants and destroying their warships.  <br><br>The player moves about the galaxy map by selecting a location.  The map shows the location of enemy warships, planets, bases, and locations to resupply.  The player can place beacons, which allows them to find enemy merchant vessels.  When the player destroys enemy merchant ships, they gain resources, which can be used to increase shield, hull, disruptor, or torpedo strength, purchase more beacons or torpedos, or repair vehicle damage.  Combat takes place from a 1st person point of view, where the player must line up enemy vessels in the center of their crosshairs to fire upon the enemy.  When the player's ship is destroyed, it's game over. The player receives a score and a rank at the end of their adventure based upon the number of enemy ships destroyed, ranging from ground pounder to starlord.  ",
