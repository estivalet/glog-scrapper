  "description": "Tube Baddies is an action-arcade game for 1-2 players.<br><br>The Tubular underworld has become so run-down that all the pipework is decaying and full of holes. Now the &quot;Big Inspector&quot; is coming to check on the condition of the underworld. Bip and Bop have to patch the holes fast and before the inspector arrives.<br><br>You play as the handyman Bip (the second player plays as Bop) and it is your goal to defeat all the Tube Baddies by shooting your stun gun at them and deflect them into Barny the Bucket, who is at the middle at the bottom of the screen.\nThe Tube Baddies will make holes in the pipes and new Tube Baddies will eventually come out of the holes, you can patch the holes by going over them and press the fire button.\nOccasionally, items will pop up, some are power-ups while others are power-downs (such as reversed controls).\nYou also have to be careful not to go into the chewing gums, as they slow you down.\nAfter every two levels you will get a score screen, telling you how well you did.",
