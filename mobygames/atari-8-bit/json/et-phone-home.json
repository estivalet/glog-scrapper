He has to search his neighborhood for pieces that the E.T. wants to build his transmitter.  Depending on the difficulty level, the player may or may not need all the pieces to complete the game. It is also possible to communicate telepathically with E.T. to get a reminder of which pieces he is looking for. As Elliott looks for the pieces, he is pursued by a number of men who are trying to stop him from completing his task.  ",
