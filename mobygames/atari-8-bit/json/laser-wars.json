  "description": "<i>Laser Wars</i> is a space-themed shooter for the Atari 400/800.<br><br>The Lizardmen have come and gone, swooping down from the skies to seek their prey, they have ravaged many of the great cities of Earth.  You are prepared for their next assault, armed with a weapon 1000 times more powerful than a laser, and an effective range of 100 miles, you will shoot down Lizardman craft as they approach.  This is the last great weapon to protect Earth and the city you protect.<br><br>The player can move their laser left and right, but only when enemy ships are on the screen.  Enemy warships will intermittently warp onto the field, and bombard the city in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  The player shoots a laser that streaks vertically up and down from the crosshairs, destroying any enemy vessel caught in its path, which will then fall to the ground creating a mushroom cloud.  The player city can survive 25 hits before being lost.  The goal is to maximize score by destroying as many vessels as possible.  There are a total of 9 levels of difficulty to play.  ",
