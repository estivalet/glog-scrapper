Your mission is to rid the mansion of ghosts before they get you.  The player controls a small character, whom must eat a series of dots within a maze.  In 2-player mode, 2 players play simultaneously.  Hunting the player are 4 ghosts, whom if come in contact will cause the player to lose a life.  The player starts with 3 lives.  There are 4 power pellets on each level, which when consumed, make the ghosts temporarily vulnerable.  Each level has progressively faster ghosts. <br><br>Has several unique features, including instant-hide, which causes a player to instantly disappear for 5 seconds, to save themselves from ghost attack.
