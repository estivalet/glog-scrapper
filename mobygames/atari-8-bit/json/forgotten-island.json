  "description": "<i>Escape from Vulcan's Isle</i> is a fantasy-themed adventure game with light RPG elements. <br><br>A navigator of great renown, you are swept up in a tropical storm, and shipwrecked upon an uncharted volcanic isle.  Exploring a nearby cave, you discover the diary of Alcemnon, a sailor who perished years before.  The pages speak of magical artifacts and frightening creatures present on the island.  Played from an overhead perspective via joystick, the player must explore the deep caverns and volcanic crevices of Vulcan Isle. The player must gather items to aid their escape from the island, including: a magic flute, a cloak of invisibility, and powerful spells.  A lone village on the island can sell resources to the player. Various enemies including flesh-eating Harrises, limb-wrenching Satyrs, and Winged Demons haunt the island to prevent escape. The player receives regular updates on their time and progress through the journey.<br><br>The game contains a combat system, and the player is warned when enemies are nearby. Monsters present on the map will move incessantly towards the player. When the player is engaged, they can choose to either flee or enter combat. The game rolls a random damage value for the player and monster based upon items collected and power-ups discovered. Battle success is based upon when the player stops the random dice roll.",
