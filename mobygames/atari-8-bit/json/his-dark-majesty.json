  "description": "In this homebrew top-down RPG tactics game, the action is controlled with a cursor, with which you can select the units.<br><br>Regarding the plot - an evil army has descended upon the land, bringing very hard, dark times. The king has been executed and his son is banished into prison since a decade now. Hope seems lost until someone frees the king's son and prisoners. It is time to claim back the land! <br><br>In-game, the first click reveals yellow tiles around the selected unit that tell where it can go in the current turn. The second click reveals brown blocks in proximity - these tell where or what can the unit attack. Click on a yellow square and the unit goes there. Click on a brown square and the unit may attack. <br><br>After you have done your moves, holding the fire button ends your turn and the AI makes its own. There are close range and artillery units, each one with different statistics like health, strength, shielding, speed. Lord units can make others stronger if they are nearby. <br><br>There are a variety of missions, like escaping from prison, open field battles, city siege, and more. Features include 23 levels, 26 different kind of units (swordsmen, bowmen, mages, catapults, beasts, etc), and a challenging AI player. Furthermore, there is a story line with cutscenes and dialogs, and a tutorial. Your progress gets saved automatically.",
