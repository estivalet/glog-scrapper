  "description": "<i>Diamond Mine</i> is a single screen maze game where the aim is to collect all the diamonds over various levels. You sit at the top of the screen and you must extend a pipe and steer it around the maze avoiding the walls to reach the diamonds. You have a certain length of pipe that can be used and this decreases everytime you extend your pipe. Also moving around the maze are bugs and if you touch one of these or touch the walls then your pipe length allowance decreases even more and your pipe goes back to you at the top of the screen. When you reach a diamond then your pipe goes back to you and you then start extending it for another diamond. When you pipe length reaches zero it is game over.",
