  "description": "Your civilization is under attack, and it's down to you and your <i>Laser Hawk</i> helicopter to put things right. Destroy the five bases belonging to Proc Irata. They have sent their full fleet of ships to intercept you - shoot to destroy, and avoid those bullets. The centres are increasingly well-defended, with bombs, missiles and meteors among the threats. Many upward-shooting ground targets are destructible, but beware of the trees they are interspersed with. You have limited fuel, but fuel stocks hang through the air - contact with these triggers a refuel.",
