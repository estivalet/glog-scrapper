  "description": "<i>The Mouse that Ate Chicago</i> is the fifteenth in series of monthly text adventures for multiple systems.<br><br>The greedy and warped mind of Professor Rainier Frankenfeld has led to the creation if an enlarging ray, which can make any object several hundred times its normal size.  As the professor prepares to enlarge a diamond, several mice scamper into the field.  Four mice, Sam, Maja, Puji, and Fiji have been enlarged to gigantic size, and begin to wreck havoc about Chicago.  The player, while out joyriding in their truck in the outskirts of Chicago, runs out of fuel.   It is around that time, that they start to notice the surrounding mouse-related devastation.  The player must use trickery to defeat the four mice to protect the inhabitants of Chicago.<br><br>All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.",
