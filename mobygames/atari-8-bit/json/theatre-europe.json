In your control are air and ground units. These are backed up by your ability to make strategic nuclear/chemical attacks.<br><br>As the Warsaw Pact commander your task is to break the lines of the NATO alliance, which you see is a powerful invasion force, poised on your border. Your first task is to take over West Germany.<br><br>As NATO commander your task is to stop the Russian invasion. Hold the lines on West Germany's border. You will achieve this by preventing the occupation of West Germany.<br><br>Your computer opponent can play in three different ways. Nuclear weapons can be disabled for a Beginner game, while the thought processes can be either rational or unpredictable.<br><br>Gameplay is turn-based and primarily strategic, but some scenes can be played out in optional action sequences.",
