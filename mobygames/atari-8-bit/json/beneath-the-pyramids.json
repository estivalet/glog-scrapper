  "description": "<i>Beneath the Pyramids</i> is a 1-player adventure/RPG hybrid set in ancient Egypt.<br><br>The year is 1932, and you have been sent by the British Museum to the plains of Giza in search for a priceless artifact in the Great Pyramid.  It is rumored that within a golden chamber lies a solid gold cat statue of the ancient cat goddess Bast.  Many adventurers have entered the Sphinx in the past in search of this treasure without success, and now it is your turn.  Beware, for at night the living dead walk the icy stone passages beneath the pyramids.  <br><br>At the beginning of each game, the player must purchase items to help them on their pyramid exploration.  The player can purchase weapons, including a rifle or a crossbow.  The player's purchases are limited by weight and cost, and they can not return to the bazaar later.  Essential survival items, including: lanterns, matches, roper, grapples, pickaxes, bandages, and protective wool coats can be purchased.  The Apple II version allows the player to barter with the shopkeeper to save several coins.  The goal is to enter the pyramid, and explore the numerous caverns and chambers to gather items and clues.  These items must be used to surpass a number of puzzles present with the pyramid.  A variety of treasures can be found during exploration as well.  The player encounters a variety of monsters which must be battled, and there are a variety of traps through the pyramid which can disable the player without the correct items.<br><br>In the Atari 400/800 version, gameplay occurs from a large scrolling top-down perspective.  Monsters and players move simultaneously, and monsters can be easily avoided, and monsters are always present on the screen.  In the Apple II version, the pyramid consists of a number of interconnected screens, and monsters will appear spontaneously.  In the Apple II version, movement is turn-based, and the player and monster take turns moving.  <br><br>The Atari version allows saved games, while the Apple II version does not.   <br><br>",
