  "description": "You control a mysterious 19th-century machine named &quot;The Eidolon&quot; through mysterious caves.   Collect and create fireballs and encounter strange creatures like 'Greps', 'Biter Birds', 'Bottlenecks', 'Rotoflies', 'Puffer Birds' , and 'Guardian Dragons'.   Each type of fireball you collect has different effects.  For instance Blue fireballs freeze time, and green fireballs transform one monster into another type.  A guardian dragon must be defeated at the end of each level.<br><br><i>Eidolon</i> is one of the progenitors of the first-person shooter genre, with full pseudo-3D panoramic graphics.  This was achieved with the use of Lucasfilm Games 3D fractal technology, also used in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/rescue-on-fractalus\">Rescue on Fractalus!</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/koronis-rift\">Koronis Rift</a>.",
