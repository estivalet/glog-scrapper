  "description": "<i>Space Cowboy</i> is an arcade game for the Atari 8-bit systems.<br><br>In the galactic year 7401, a free-roving private spacer, known as a Space Cowboy, landed his vessel on the feudal planet Dungeon.  Space Cowboy was looking for adventure; he was not expecting to be arrested on false charges as soon as he landed his ship.  Before being incarcerated in the cells of Castle Langour, Space Cowboy did manage to seal his ship so that it would open only to his body aura pattern.  For three years Space Cowboy was a restless prisoner planning an escape to his waiting ship, to lift off and find a more cordial planet.  Finally the moment to escape arrived and Space Cowboy broke out of the castle.  But, there was still the gauntlet ahead of him.<br><br>The player must move along the narrow ramparts of the castle, avoiding a number of lasers which fire from the left hand side of the screen.  The player must time their moves carefully to not get shot, and they are also at danger of falling off the ramparts.  The player starts with 10 stamina, and every time time they are hit or fall off a platform, they lose a point.  If the player loses all of their stamina, it's game over.  The game shows the player's speed and the distance to their awaiting space ship on the bottom of the screen.  ",
