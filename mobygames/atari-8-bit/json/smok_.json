  "description": "<i>Smok</i> is an adaptation of the classical concept of snake games for up to two players. The player has to guide a dragon through a board. The player must feed the dragon with the randomly appearing spiders to score points, however feeding the dragon makes it grow longer. The later the dragon will eat the spider, the more points he receives. The dragon loses a life when he bites its own or opponent's tail, eats an obstacle in the form of a head or a ball (choking) or hit the wall. ",
