  "description": "<i>Ziggurat</i> is the fourth part of the <i>Warriors of Ras</i> series of RPGs for multiple systems.<br><br>The famed Ziggurat of Ras, tomb of the wretched king whose reign of horror reduced the prosperous lands of Ras to poverty.  The Zombie King's soul lies trapped within the pyramid, destined to devour the minds of would-be looters.  You have come to the door of that dreaded pyramid in search of the Sapient Scepter of Sirocco, which has the power to break the spell of the evil king and return Ras to prosperity. <br><br>The player explores a number of randomized dungeon levels containing hallways and rooms, and most move progressively upwards seeking the desired item.  All commands including movement are via text commands. The player can return to the starting area to buy and sell goods, as well as store gold for future adventuring.  While exploring the dungeon, the player can teleport through the levels, and can also cleave their way through walls using a pickax. <br><br>Combat occurs on a separate map, where the player encounters multiple opponents. Combat areas resemble the player's location in the dungeon.  The player and enemies takes turns moving and attacking, and the player has a total of 13 different locations they can attack on enemies and 9 separate body locations to defend, but if vitals locations are lost, the player perishes. The player can aim their attacks, or flail randomly. They can also choose more forceful attacks. The player can throw items to cause increased damage, and numerous single use spells can be purchased and used.  The player can gain valuable items and weapons after combat, and will progressively level up and become stronger with successful combats. Magical items can be found in combat to give the player an edge.<br><br>Ultimately, the goal is to reach the top level of the ziggurat, and defeat the guardian mummy. The player must then return to the exit to claim victory.",
