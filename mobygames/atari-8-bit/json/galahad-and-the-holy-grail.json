  "description": "In <i>Galahad and the Holy Grail</i> Sir Galahad has been charged with finding the holy grail. This is done in a flip-screen style traversing over many screens, being chased by three evil knights, a moth, many spiders, a deadly bunny, and a dragon all trying to stop you from completing your quest.<br><br>The game is a derivative of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Adventure\">Adventure</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?company=Atari\">Atari</a>, released in 1980. Your character can only carry one item at a time, but there are a shield, sword, speed wedge, three keys, a holy hand grenade, and the titular Holy Grail to pick up. The shield defends you from taking any damage, the sword can face left or right and kills any enemies but the moth if you touch it with it. There are about 100 rooms.",
