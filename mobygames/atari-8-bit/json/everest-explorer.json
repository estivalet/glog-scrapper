  "description": "<i>Everest Explorer</i> is a tactical simulation of climbing Mount Everest for multiple systems.<br><br>Developed by experienced mountaineers, the player attempts to summit Mount Everest with a team of international climbers and local Sherpas.  The player starts with $230,000, and must purchase personnel, as well as tents, fuel, food, and oxygen tanks.  The player must choose the time of year for their ascent, which influences weather conditions, and plan ahead for the 2 - 3 week journey to transport supplies to base camp 1.  Gameplay occurs in daily segments, and each climber and Sherpa has individual health, and can be given specific daily tasks including transporting supplies and clearing ice falls.  A doctor accompanies the team, and can help keep local crew in the same camp healthy.  Each day, weather conditions effect the health of your crew, and random events such as avalanches can have devastating effects on the team.  <br><br>The team of Sherpas have morale, and if they are mistreated or experience a number of deaths, they may choose to abandon the expedition leaving the climbers to their own.  The goal is to move supplies to progressively higher base camps, eventually getting crew and supplies to camp 6.  From there, the player attempts to summit with at least 2 climbers, and then safely bring the entire crew back to camp 1 safely.  <br><br>",
