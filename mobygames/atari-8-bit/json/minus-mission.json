Within the vehicle is a number that can be increased or decreased by the player.  Creatures fall from the ceiling, each of which contains a subtraction question, and the player must set the correct number on the vehicle to shoot the appropriate approaching creature.  More creatures rapidly appear, and if any of them reach the bottom of the screen, it's game over.",
