  "description": "You play Shamus, a sort of detective and dungeon-crawling adventurer in one.  In a previous game, you managed to get your bad guy, but now he has escaped, and you must go into his underground lair to bring him back.<br><br>Getting through the game means surviving the traps and monsters spread throughout the dungeon.  You must also get past the wrong turns.  To get by the monsters, you must either avoid them, or use a weapon (limited shots).<br><br>Throughout the dungeon are treasure chests, cache's of useful things, such as keys and hints.",
