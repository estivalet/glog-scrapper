  "description": "<i>Attank!</i> is a 2-player tank game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>Played from a top-down perspective, each player controls 2 tanks, and tries to destroy the enemy vehicles.  Terrain is randomized, but includes tunnels that allow a player to warp across the field, heavy impenetrable forests, lighter forests, impassable swamps and large rocks.  Hidden mines can destroy tanks, and terrain can be destroyed if shot or run over.  The player can customize the number of hits each tank can receive, shell range, and tunnel configuration.  There are options for random bombings, that can destroy sections of the map.  There is also a nighttime option, where only tank position and shell strikes are displayed.  ",
