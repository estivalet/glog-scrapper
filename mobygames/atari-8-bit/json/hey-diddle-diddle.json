  "description": "<i>Hey Diddle Diddle</i> is an educational game for young children that teaches reasoning skills through the use of nursery rhymes. It is made up of three parts: storytime, storybook and rhyme game. Storytime and storybook displays all the rhymes accompanied with music and images. The difference between the two is that in the storybook the player decides when to advance in the reading. In the rhyme game, the player is presented with four or eight lines (depending on level) from a rhyme and has to put them in the correct order. The game can be played with a timer and the player's score depends on how fast the rhyme is solved. It's playable by one or two players.",
