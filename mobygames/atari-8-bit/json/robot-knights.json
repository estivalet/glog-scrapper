  "description": "The mad scientist Evil Otto has escaped into the past. You control a group of Robot Knights who have travelled back in time to hunt him down, before he can complete the monster he is creating.<br><br>Robot Knights is a platform game where you choose to control one of two types of knight. One carries a shield; the other a bow. The aim is to collect all of the objects (such as energy capsules) and defeat all of the fireball throwing creatures on the screen. The creatures may only be defeated by reflecting a fireball back at them. This may be done by blocking a fireball with the shield, or shooting it with the arrow. However contact with a fireball will reduce the player's energy, as will contact with one of the creatures. Once the player's energy is depleted, the game is lost. After each screen is completed, a door opens allowing the player to progress to the next room of the scientist's lair.\n",
