  "description": "<i>Divex</i> is an educational math shooting game for multiple systems.<br><br>The player controls a small space vessel which can travel horizontally on the bottom side of the screen, and fire vertically upwards.  The player can choose whether to do multiplication or addition questions, and these are displayed on the top of the screen.  Four yellow alien vessels begin to descend towards the player, and they are represented by a possible answer to the equation.  The player's goal is to shoot the correct ship, and then destroy the other vessels.  While this is occurring, fast moving red ships will drop towards the bottom of the screen.  If any ship reaches the bottom of the screen, it reduces the player's firing distance, as represented by a blue bar on the left.  The player faces waves of 4 yellow vessels at a time, and the player must shoot enough yellow vessels to fill the green bar on the left.  After each wave, a diagonally moving alien vessel will descend, which can damage the player.  After the green bar is filled, the player advances to the next more challenging level. ",
