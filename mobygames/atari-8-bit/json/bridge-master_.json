  "description": "<i>Bridge Master</i> is a 1-player bridge card game for multiple systems.  <br><br>Written in BASIC, this is a text-based bridge simulation.  Bidding features include the Blackwood convention, Stayman convention, pre-emptive openings, and recognition of demand bids and jump shift responses. The program plays the North hand as the player's partner and East-West as their opponents.  The player does not control their partner's gameplay.  The player can choose a seed value to shuffle their deck, allowing identical games to be played in the future.  After playing a specific hand, the player may replay the same hand with the option of switching cards with your computer opponents.   Game includes options to create and modify opponents.",
