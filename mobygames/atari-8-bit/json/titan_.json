  "description": "<i>Titan</i> is a 1 - 4 player strategy and arcade mining game for multiple systems.<br><br>The year is 2050, and The Solar Mining Authority, it its ever-expanding quest for raw material, has finally decided to entertain bids from different corporations for the exclusive mining rights to Titan, one of the moons of Saturn.  In an attempt to ensure maximum efficiency from the operators of the Titan concession, The Solar mining Authority has decided to permit four companies to operate on Titan using Probationary License Permits, for a period of one Earth year.  At the end of one year, the most efficient organization will win the sole mining rights for Dilithium 3 crystals, a valuable resource found only on Titan.  <br><br>Gameplay is in two distinct phases.  In the first phase, players must use their available resources to purchase mining equipment and supplies/resources for their employees.  Drill rigs can mine the earth vertically, while robominers skim the earth horizontally.  Meteor deflection shields protect miners, and refineries can help improve the value of the Dilithium 3 crystals once obtained.  Power plants provide energy for mining resources.  For employees, the player must carefully weigh resources spent on luxuries and payroll versus maximizing profit from the employees.<br><br>In the second phase, the player controls the location and area of digging for drill rigs and robominers.  Player from a side-view, the player must manually controls the area of the dig to look for resources.  ",
