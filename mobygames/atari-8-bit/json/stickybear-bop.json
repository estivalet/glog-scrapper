  "description": "<i>Stickybear Bop</i> is a 1-player carnival shooter for kids.<br><br>Based upon the Stickybear series of games for children, the player controls a small shooting device which can move horizontally left and right at the bottom of the screen.  The player shoots vertically upwards, and must hit a number objects or points.  Each level consists of 3 rounds, where the player has a limited number of balls.  In the first round, the player shoots objects that are moving horizontally across the screen, with smaller higher objects worth more points.  In the second round, 2 bears on the sides of the screen juggle objects, and the player has to shoot them as they are juggled.  In the final round, Stickybear drops objects from a balloon, and the player must shoot them as they fall to the ground.  After completing the 3 rounds, the player moves onto a more difficult series of challenges.  The player loses if they are unable to hit any objects on a level, if they are hit by a projectile from Stickybear's balloon, or if on later lives any of the dropped bags from the balloon hit the ground.
