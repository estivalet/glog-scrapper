Its role: to deter further acts of nuclear war between the empires of the galaxy. Should critical levels of nuclear activity be detected emanating from the surface of the satellites, the machine will activate and destroy both civilizations.<br><br>Marauding invaders, from the ZAGOS GALAXY, unaware of the danger from the doomsday machine, launch a nuclear attack against PHOLOS. XYLOS then launches a counter-offensive with hypnobeams against the ZAGS, slowing down the critical build-up of nuclear radiation.<br><br>YOUR MISSION: As the saviour of the galaxy, you must locate the legendary GOOD MEDIATOR to acquire the mythical TIME CRYSTAL, which endows the possessor with the power to psychokinetically dispatch any destructive elements to another time zone. Leave XYLOS, and seek out the planet far, far below... but, be prepared at any time to be recalled to XYLOS and PHOLOS to combat the ZAGS using your joystick controlled missiles.",
