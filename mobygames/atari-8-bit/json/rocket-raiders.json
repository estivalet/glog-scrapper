  "description": "<i>Rocket Raiders</i> is a 1-player arcade game for the Atari 8-bit system.<br><br>The player is in control of a futuristic city surrounded by a blue force field.  Alien bombs rain from above, and the player must shoot them out of the sky from the defensive turret located in the city before the bombs crash into the shield.  As the bombs crash, they destroy the shield and the underlying city.  Intermittently, alien spacecraft appear, which must be shot before they land in the city.  If the central turret is destroyed, the player can no longer defend themselves, and the aliens can land with impunity.  The goal is to survive as many bombs as possible.  ",
