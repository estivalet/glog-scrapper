  "description": "<i>Crypt of the Undead</i> is a fantasy-themed adventure game with light RPG elements. <br><br>You awake in a cemetery.  How you got there, you do not know.  The night is cold and damp, and the sun has just gone down.  You have 12 hours to escape the cemetery, or you will become a resident there permanently.  Played from an overhead perspective via joystick, the player must locate keys to explore the various crypts of the cemetery.  They must also collect gold to increase their power, and can find bagels to sustain their health.  Eventually, you must find the key which allows you to exit the cemetery. Various enemies including vampires, werewolves, and zombies haunt the corridors of the cemetery.  The player receives regular updates on their time and progress through the journey.<br><br>The game contains a combat system, and the player is warned when enemies are nearby. Monsters present on the map will move incessantly towards the player. When the player is engaged, they can choose to either flee or enter combat. The game rolls a random damage value for the player and monster based upon items collected and power-ups discovered. Battle success is based upon when the player stops the random dice roll.",
