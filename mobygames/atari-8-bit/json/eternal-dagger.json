  "description": "This sequel to SSI's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/wizards-crown\">Wizard's Crown</a> plays very much like the original. It's a fantasy RPG where you assemble a party of adventurers and explore a map.  In this game, the world is being invaded by Demons coming in from a portal to another dimension, and your job is to find the one item that can seal the portal, The Eternal Dagger.<br><br>Like <i>Wizard's Crown</i>, this game is notable for its detailed, tactical combat system. There was also a &quot;quick combat&quot; mode if you didn't want to spend the time in the tactical mode, allowing you to focus more on conventional RPG features such as exploration.",
