  "description": "<i>Rosen's Brigade</i> is a side-scrolling arcade game.<br><br>You and your men were on a secret bombing mission when the enemy struck.  Your fellow flyers are overcome by the enemy's vast number, but you, the ace pilot, manage to escape.  As you fly to freedom, your men are bailing out into the hands of the enemies.<br><br>The player controls a plane which can move in 8 directions and fire directly forwards.  Friendly soldiers will intermittently parachute from the top of the screen, and you may pick them up for bonus points.  On each level, the goal is to destroy all enemy vessels, and there are a total of 10 difficulty levels.  Each level contains a lake and a mountain to navigate, and there are progressively more difficult enemies, including: transports, helicopters, tanks, and boats.<br><br>The player starts with three planes, and when all are lost, it's game over.",
