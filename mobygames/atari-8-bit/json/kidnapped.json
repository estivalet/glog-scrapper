  "description": "<i>Kidnapped!</i> is an early text adventure for multiple systems.<br><br>The player has been kidnapped and placed on the 9th floor of an office building, with the goal to descend all 9 levels to win their freedom.  The player must solve numerous text-based puzzles to open the way to the next level down, but multiple dangers await the player on each level.  All commands are via VERB NOUN entry. \n Each level presents a unique challenge, with the items obtained on previous levels not carried over to the next.  Most mistakes are fatal, and frequent restarting is required.  No save or restore feature is available, and any death restarts the player on the level they died on.  ",
