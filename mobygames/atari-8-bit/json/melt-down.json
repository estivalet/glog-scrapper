You discover a leak in the cooling tower, and are tasked with maintaining a safe level in the tower to prevent a nuclear disaster.  You do this by carrying buckets of water from a sink at the bottom of a series of platforms and ladders, and dumping them into the top of the tower.  <br><br>Mutant radioactive mice crawl from both sides of the maze, and the player must jump over them.  The player receives bonus point for jumping over a mouse and each bucket filled into the tower.  There are 4 skill levels. ",
