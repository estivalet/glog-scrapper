  "description": "<i>Operation Market Garden</i> is a recreation of the largest daylight airborne operation in history on September 17, 1944. As commander of the Allied forces you will direct the American  82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the British 1st Airborne Division and the 30th Corps to their historical objectives.

The level of victory (5 levels) is determined by Allied points at the end of the game. The game can be played by 2 people or solitaire (computer as German), has four levels of difficulty and can be played as either intermediate level or advanced. Playing time is 10 hours.",
