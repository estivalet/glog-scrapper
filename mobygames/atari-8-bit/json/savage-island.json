  "description": "<i>Savage Island</i> is the only multi-part game in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Scott+Adams\">Scott Adams'</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Scott+Adams+adventure\">adventure series</a>, all of which have a very similar parser and interface.  At the completion of this game, players receive a password which allows <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/savage-island-part-two\">part two</a> to be played. The Savage Island games are also probably the most difficult adventures in the series!<br><br>The player begins trapped on a small remote island in the ocean, which is facing a hurricane and also has an active volcano. The player can cross a river, and will also need to explore a cave network. Items are often found by running through the sand with one's hands. <br><br>The island holds a great secret, which will not be discovered until both parts of the game have been completed.",
