You must jump from cloud to cloud, collecting everything you can, to reach the sun.<br><br>You must jump from cloud to cloud and touch any items or eggs to collect them. If an egg hatches into a dragon, you can kick the dragon to collect him. There is a bonus timer that counts down on the screen so don't delay.
