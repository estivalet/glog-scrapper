  "description": "<i>Galactic Chase</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/galaxian\">Galaxian</a> variant. The player controls a space ship with a simple task: kill all alien invaders. The ship is restricted to horizontal movement on the lower part of the screen - while the enemy formation sticks to the same movement pattern, occasionally one or more ships break out and attack the player directly. If they (or one of their shots) hits the player ship, one of the three lives is lost. Additional lives are earned after 7000 points are earned or after a set amount of levels is passed.<br><br>The goal of the game is to achieve a high score; the four kinds of enemy ships give a different amount of points. When they are attacking, their point worth is doubled. The three difficulty levels can be set before beginning a game or it automatically increases after ten levels have been finished. Level two makes enemies faster and level three the own shots slower. Multiplayer is a high-score comparison.",
