  "description": "<i>Star Trek III</i> is one of many Star Trek variants, but was not officially licensed from Paramount Pictures.<br><br>The player plays as captain of the USS Enterprise.  Your job is to investigate Omega VI, a poorly explored segment of the galaxy, which contains several Class M planets, several large stars and black holes, a star base, and even a pulsar.   Recently, this area has been invaded by Klingon vessels bent on subjugating it to their will.  Your job as captain is to explore all segments of Omega VI, send a landing crew to explore each habitable planet, and destroy all Klingon vessels present.<br><br><i>Star Trek III</i> is played through a variety of text-based menus, which allow the player to control the USS Enterprise's weapons, warp drive, sensors, and engines.  Graphical displays allow the player to determine which quadrants have been explored, their location within each quadrant, and the current damage status of their vessel.  The player must warp to each of the segments of Omega VI, in order to complete the prescribed mission. The III in the title refers to the fact this version of the game features quadrants in three dimensions rather than the usual two that other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Star+Trek+variants\">Star Trek</a> games use.",
