  "description": "<i>Battlefield!!!</i> is a 2-player text-based strategy war game for multiple systems.<br><br>Players control two opposing armies, with the offensive player's goal to score a set number of victory points, while the defensive player's goal is to prevent them from reaching that score.  All terrain and units are displayed via text on the screen, and includes hills, forests, swamps, and rough terrain, which effect troop movement rates and defensive and offensive capabilities.  Players can set the winning conditions, army sizes, troop setup, as well as choose from 8 separate terrains to play on.  During gameplay, the two opposing sides take turns issuing movement and attack commands, and the result of these decisions are then displayed onscreen.  Games can be saved in progress, and restored at a later time.  ",
