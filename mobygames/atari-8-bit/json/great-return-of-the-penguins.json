  "description": " <i>The Great Return of the Penguins</i> is an attempt to refresh <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pingwinek++Pingwinek+Idzie+do+Szko%c5%82y\"> the previous edition of the game</a>, titled <i>Pingwinek idzie do szko?y</i>. The main goal requires carrying safely a specified number of penguins from home to another igloo within designated time. To do so it's necessary to cover (by moving joystick in a direction of referred arrow) a hole in the ice each time a little penguin is close by. The hole remains covered for only 3 seconds. Completion of the task requires sending a few penguins at the same time, starting and finishing in different igloos. Following the corresponding arrows and releasing the penguins at the right time is the key to complete the level.",
