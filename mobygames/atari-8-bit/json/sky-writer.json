  "description": "<i>Sky Writer</i> is an educational action game for children.<br><br>You steer the plane &quot;Sky Writer&quot; and while you are flying, clouds with words in them are drifting by.<br><br>Your goal is to combine two root words to create a compound word that fits the description at the top of the screen. For example the description says &quot;Well-mannered guy&quot; then the answer would be &quot;gentle&quot; + &quot;man&quot; = &quot;gentleman&quot;\nFor each correct root word you score 10 times the number of the level you're at.<br><br>If you choose a wrong root word or if you get the correct root words in the wrong order your plane will crash. Your plane will also crash if it flies into a raincloud, which will appear from level 3 onwards.\nIf you run out of fuel your plane will also crash. There is no way to refill your fuel, so you better hurry.<br><br>The game has 8 levels and you can choose whether you want to start from level 1 or level 3 in the options menu.\nWhen you complete a level, you score 10 the number of the level you're at, multiplied by the number of fuel units you have left.\nShould you make it all the way through level 8, you score an additional 5 percent of your total score for each unused plane and you'll also receive a bonus message.",
