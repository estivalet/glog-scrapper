  "description": "<i>Berserker Raid</i> is a 1 - 2 player science-fiction themed strategy game for multiple systems<br><br>From time before human memory, great automated war machines were created by an unknown alien race.  These Berserkers, programmed to eliminate all life that they encounter, still roam the galaxy.<br><br>Gameplay occurs in a 10 system star cluster.  Each player has a home base, and can send out merchant ships to establish production bases in other systems.  The player's goal is to strengthen defenses and construct a fleet of their own vessels to counter the Berserker threat.  The player can create customized ships that will take a varying number of resources to produce or choose from 5 predefined vessels.  The player can possess a maximum fleet of 10 vessels.  Each base has a technology and productivity statistic.  Technology defines how advanced of ship a base can build, while productivity determines how fast it can build.  Each base also has a defensive rating to determine their strength against Berserker attack.  <br><br>At a varying interval, the Berserker fleet will appear, and begin to hunt for your home base.  The bases's missiles will weaken the fleet, and then the player must enter into ship-to-ship combat, which is a strategy affair where ships takes turns attacking and defending.  Only 3 ships can engage at one time.  Victory is obtained by defeating all of the Berserker vessels, and repossessing all of your original bases.  <br><br>The game comes preloaded with 10 scenarios, and a corresponding vignette is available in the manual.  The player can also create their own novel scenarios.,  ",
