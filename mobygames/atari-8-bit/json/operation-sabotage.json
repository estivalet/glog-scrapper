  "description": "<i>Operation: Sabotage</i> is a text adventure released for multiple systems.<br><br>It is the year 2101 and war has broken out between Earth and the distant planet Zekloke.  This alien power has established a large military complex on Mars which will soon become a great danger to Earth.  Hidden in the massive installation are several secret documents containing the plans for an incredible defense shield - strong enough to stop an entire fleet of spacecraft.  You are a special agent and have just succeeded in sneaking into the alien complex.  Your mission is to destroy this threat to mankind and return with plans for the powerful defense shield.  <br><br>All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles.  Numerous items not required to complete the main quest abound throughout the spaceship.  There is no save or restore feature. Various monsters are found at specific locations, which can be defeated in text-based combat. Combat consists of attacking the enemy, and choosing which weapon to do this. The player does not have hitpoints or statistics, but if they take a number of hits during combat, they are defeated.",
