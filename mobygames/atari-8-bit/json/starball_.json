  "description": "<i>Starball</i> is a side scrolling arcade game. The aim of the player is to escape of trapped prison by properly using the acquired items. The player controls the direction and the speed of the ball. Flip the ball from the obstacle causing considerable acceleration. With each passing second energy of the ball is constantly decreasing. To top up the energy the player has to get a diamond. The player must avoid closing barriers, fire or swamp fields. To get into evacuation area the player has to get through many closed doors. The correct order of using the found keys is the only way to access the final position. Except of the keys and diamond the player may find few other useful items, such as a time bomb, temporary resistance to fire, canisters and hammers.\n",
