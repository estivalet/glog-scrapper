  "description": "<i>Race in Space</i> is a 2-player space themed racing game for the Atari 400/800.<br><br>2 players individually control a small spaceship, which has the ability to go forwards and backwards.  The goal is to reach the top edge of the screen, while avoiding meteorites which fly in from the lateral directions.  If the player is struck by a meteorite, they return to the bottom of the screen.  For every lap cleared, the player is awarded one point.  The player with the most points at the end of an allotted time period is the winner.  The players can control several aspects of the race, including: gravity level, the color scheme, whether the players are represented by rockets or saucers, and the presence of comets as hazards.  ",
