  "description": "<i>Astron IX</i> is a 1-player side-scrolling arcade game for the Atari 8-bit computer.<br><br>The player controls a spaceship that moves in all directions, and can fire in 8 directions.  The ship has inertia, and takes time and energy to slow down.  The spaceship needs to be navigated through a number of tight caverns while combating enemy creatures.  The player has limited firepower, men, and shields, but more can be picked up as the caverns are navigated.  Caverns consist of a number of interconnecting scrolling caverns of varying design.  Dispersed throughout are docking stations, which allows the player to equip acquired items to their ship.  The goal is to navigate the entirety of the caverns before time runs out.  ",
