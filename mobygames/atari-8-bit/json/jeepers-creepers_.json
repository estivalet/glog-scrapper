  "description": "<i>Jeepers Creepers</i> is an arcade game for the Atari 8-bit system.<br><br>The player controls a small insect which must travel around the lines of a board trying to fill in all the squares. Hunting the player are yellow wasps, which if they catch the player, causes them to lose a life. If the player surrounds an insect square, a wasp-eating beetle will be released which will hunt down some of the wasps which chase the player. When the player surrounds a key, it transports them to a random level. When the player has filled in all boxes on a level, they advance to the next level. The player has a total of 3 lives, and if all are lost, it's game over. ",
