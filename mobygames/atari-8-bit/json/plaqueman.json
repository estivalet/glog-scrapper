  "description": "<i>Plaqueman</i> is an educational action game about dental care. The game is a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> where the player moves a toothbrush around a maze full of teeth. The aim of each level is to move over the teeth so that they change from yellow to white. At the same time the player is chased by three blobs which represent plaque. As the plaque moves past yellow teeth, black dots appear that indicate tooth decay. These have to be drilled and filled which is done when holding down the fire button and moving over them. Teeth that are too decayed might drop out and will then appear at the bottom of the screen. When the entire row is full of teeth the player loses the game. The game is also over if all three lives are lost which happens when the player is caught by one of the plaque blobs. To become temporarily immune to the plaque the player can pick up tubes of fluoride tooth paste which also halts teeth decay. ",
