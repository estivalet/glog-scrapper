  "description": "<i>Armor Assault</i> is a turn-based strategy game which is about tactical tank battles between NATO and Soviets. However, this is not a wargame as each side has only six tanks to manage. The rules are relatively simple: in each round, orders are issued to the tanks and then the orders of both sides are performed simultaneously. Options include movement, setting mines or fire. The latter comes in two variants, either direct fire or opportunity fire which gets triggered when an enemy tank moves by during the movement phase - each tank is restricted to one type per round. The terrain plays a role because it changes the movement costs and can provide cover.<br><br>The game comes with six tank types (can be chosen before a match) with certain advantages and disadvantages and twelve scenarios with different victory condition (mostly to conquer or destroy a certain target). The editor can be used to create more maps and tanks.",
