  "description": "<i>Minidash</i> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> clone created for the &quot;NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014&quot; competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. <br><br>The player controls a character who digs through the ground, collecting diamonds. The player goes to the next level if he collects all the diamonds (in which case he receives a score bonus), or if the timer runs out. Apart from the diamonds, the map can have boulders or brick walls in it. More and more of these elements appear on every new level, in a random layout. Boulders and diamonds are affected by gravity, and crush the player if they fall on him, transporting him back to the starting position and taking away a life. Boulders can also be pushed left and right. ",
