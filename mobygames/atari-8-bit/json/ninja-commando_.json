  "description": "Players take control of a ninja and must guide him safely through various side-scrolling levels, jumping over pits, dodging obstacles and defeating other ninjas. In every stage, there are numerous doors that constantly spawn new attackers, although there are never more than four enemy ninjas onscreen at the same time. At first, the player's ninja can only defeat his enemies by jumping on them. Defeating three enemies in a row gives access to additional ranged weapons: shuriken, bombs, a flamethrower and a rifle. Apart from other ninjas there are also indestructible, moving obstacles and other enemies including golems, worms and birds. \n",
