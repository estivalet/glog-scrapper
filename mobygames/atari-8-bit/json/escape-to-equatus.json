  "description": "<i>Escape to Equatus</i> is a 1-player educational arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>Many light years ago in a distant galaxy, the planet Mathema collided with a meteor.  The planet was completely destroyed, but for a small band of Mathmen who escaped aboard the giant robot ship Metrica.  While searching for a new home, the Mathmen landed within a crater of the moon Equatus.  As they were exploring, an Equacion battlecruiser attacked, roaring across the mouth of the cavern expelling a mathematical problem, and unleashing a lethal number line that plummeted towards the Mathmen.<br><br>The player controls a Solutus fighter ship tasked with defending the stranded Mathmen as they await rescue.  As the numbers streak towards the player, the spaceship must be maneuvered horizontally to shoot the correct digits before they reach the Mathmen to answer the question displayed at the top of the screen.  Every incorrect answer causes Mathmen to perish, and after three incorrect answers, it's game over.  There are 4 levels of difficulty, allowing for more difficult questions, and the numbers descend faster.  <br><br>\n",
