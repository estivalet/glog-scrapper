  "description": "<i>The Dungeon of Danger</i> is a text-based roleplaying game released for multiple systems.<br><br>The player starts on a random location in a dungeon a number of levels down, with the goal to escape to the surface.  Each level of the dungeon is divided into an 8 x 8 grid, where different rooms contain passageways, combats, stairs, rogue encounters, or other surprises.  On each level, the player must find an enchanted key, which allows them to unlock the staircase to the next level up, to eventually escape the dungeon.  The player can also find a map which shows the layout for that level of the dungeon.  Two levels of difficulty are available to challenge the player.<br><br>Combat is entered randomly as the player moves between rooms.  This is turn-based, where the player take turns striking at each other, and the player can choose to try to flee between combat rounds.  The player replenishes health when moving up a dungeon level or by finding a magic potion.  ",
