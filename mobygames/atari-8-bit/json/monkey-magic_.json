  "description": "Based on the original television series that ran from 1978 to 1980, the player controls Monkey as he makes his way through four levels and rescue the princess from the evil dragon. In the first level, the player rides a cloud, and must use lightning bolts to destroy three waves of flying creatures. In the second level, the player must collect all the fruit while avoiding or jumping over creatures. Vines and ladders must be navigated in order to get some fruit. The third level has the player navigating a steep cliff. Four birds drop rocks onto the path, causing it to crack. The player must jump over these cracks. Finally, in the last level, the player must defeat the dragon by throwing spears at it, while avoiding its fire.<br><br>The C16 version has just the first level with you riding a cloud shooting waves of creatures.<br><br>",
