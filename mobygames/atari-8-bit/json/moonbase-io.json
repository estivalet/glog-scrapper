  "description": "<i>Moonbase Io</i> is a space shooter where you are a fighter pilot who has to defend the moons of Jupiter. Part of the game is a vertical scrolling shooter while part is a fixed screen shooter more similar to Space Invaders. The game code comes on either disk or cassette, but the disk version still comes with a cassette that contains speech and sound effects. For the cassette version, a single cassette contains both the code and the audio.",
