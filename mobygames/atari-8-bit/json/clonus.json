  "description": "<i>Clonus</i> is a graphical adventure game for Atari 400/800.<br><br>The player has arrived in the far flung future from the present day via a time gate. Unfortunately, as they emerge into the future city of Clonus, the gate behind them closes, and they are stuck in the future.  A top-down scrolling adventure game, the goal is to seek out the Key of Time, which allows the player to gain access to the Time Chamber, and return to the present day.  The city has an arena where the player can battle a gladiator, a casino to make money, and a clone store to sell body parts.  There are various warp chambers throughout the city, which take the player to special locations.  One of these will take the player to the Crystalware offices, whom created the game.  Here, the player can find the Key of Time.<br><br>Several zones have wandering monsters which will attack the player.  When the player encounters a monster, they will lose 10 units of energy in their defeat of the creature.  The player starts with a total of 100 energy units, and when all are lost, it's game over.  \n",
