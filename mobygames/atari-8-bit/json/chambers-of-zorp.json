  "description": "<i>Chambers of Zorp</i> is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>The planet of Zorp is in grave danger.  Only you, the space physician, can prevent a deadly epidemic.  Infectious single-celled organisms have propagated in chambers beneath the planet Zorp.   Equipped with a nimble probe vehicle, you can fire hypervaccine into the chambers to eradicate the creatures.  Unfortunately, the organisms sense your presence when you enter their chamber, and rapidly begin to multiply and mutate into aggressive predators.  Can you save the planet from peril?<br><br>The player moves a small vehicle, which can move in all directions, and shoots two streams of bullets forwards.  The player moves between chambers, and has 99 time units to eradicate the dangers in each chamber.  At the beginning of each stage, a number of alien eggs appear, which begin to hatch if the player can't shoot them in time.  These creatures begin to assault the player.  \nThere are three levels of difficulty: intern, doctor, and surgeon.  The player starts with 3 probes, and when all are lost, it's game over.  ",
