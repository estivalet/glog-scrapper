  "description": "<i>Wordman</i> is a vocabulary game for multiple systems.<br><br>A set of 5 concentric rings contain a number of words, but they are missing the first letter.  A letter travels around each ring, starting on the outer ring, and as the letter passes a partial word, the player must indicate if this forms a true word or not.  If the player is correct, the word is crossed out, and if a word is missed, the player must travel around the whole circle to try again.  The letter is constantly changing as it passes each word.  When a circle is completed, the player moves to the next inner circle.  The border slowly moves towards the border, and if the player is to slow, they will lose.  The game tracks the number of successful hits and misses.  ",
