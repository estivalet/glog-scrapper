  "description": "<i>Caverns of Khafka</i> is an action game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?gamegroup=Indiana+Jones\">Indiana Jones</a> movies. The cover features gold, pharaohs and a tan pants clad protagonist missing only the trademark hat. The plot is familiar; facing the treacherous caverns of rolling boulders and deadly insects, you set out on a search for the five seals to unlock and raid the king's chambers. Be prepared for a trying time as the tools at your disposal include only your trusty grapple-action whip and gravity defying jump. <br><br>While the original C-64 version features large sprites and 8-way scrolling the Atari XL version has levels that fit on one screen, a smaller player sprite reminding of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=lode-runner\">Loderunner</a>, and different soundtrack.",
