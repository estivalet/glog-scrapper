  "description": "<i>Boing!</i> is an arcade game for multiple systems.<br><br>Bouncing Barney is bouncing on a trampoline, but he has trouble staying on.  If he bounces to the left of the trampoline he goes to the right, and vice versa.  The player must move the trampoline horizontally beneath Barney to try to keep him from falling off of the trampoline.  The more bounces Barney gets, the higher he goes, and the more difficult the game becomes.  There is a total of 10 difficulty levels, with the goal to maximize Baerney's bounces.",
