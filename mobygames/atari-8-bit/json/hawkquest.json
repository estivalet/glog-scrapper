  "description": "The follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/laser-hawk\">Laser Hawk</a> takes a wider view of the universe. Your aim is to take over several hostile planets, such as the verdant Xavier and militaristic Cytron.<br><br>Gameplay takes a wider range too, eschewing the side-view blasting of its predecessor. There are two distinct gameplay styles. First you must fly up the screen <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/xevious\">Xevious</a>-style, destroying the force field towards the end of the level (fail to do this and you must replay the whole level). You must face waves of enemies as well as ground installations. There are many hidden targets to shoot; these release white flags which when collected award extra lives, a short-term shield, or a points bonus.<br><br>Once you reach an accessible base, you must enter it on foot, in a section with similar gameplay to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?quickSearch=5013442533543\">Gauntlet</a>. Keys, weapons and bonus items are hidden in hatches on the wall, which are activated by touching them (most are empty, however). Blasting through walls (using a different weapon to your main one) is a large part of progression on these.",
