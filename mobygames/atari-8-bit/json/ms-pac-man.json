  "description": "In 1981, a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i>.  This sequel continued on the &quot;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&quot; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.<br><br>Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.<br><br>Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.<br><br>Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &quot;Junior&quot;.",
