  "description": "<i>King Arthur's Heir</i> is a black and white fantasy-themed adventure game with light RPG elements. <br><br>After accomplishing many great feats of chivalry, you have risen to become the right hand of King Arthur of the Britons.  He has declared you his heir over his own relative Mordred.  To prove yourself worthy, you must locate the Scroll of Truth, which has been hidden by the wizard Merlin, and return it to Camelot.  Played from an overhead perspective via joystick, the player explores the medieval British countryside.  The player can visit various British towns, and must collect gold and other resources to become more powerful.  Various enemies including dragons, the Devil, the giant Gogmagog, the Black Wizard, and others will attempt to stop your progress.  The player receives regular updates on their time and progress through this journey.<br><br>The game contains a combat system, and the player is warned when enemies are nearby. Monsters present on the map will move incessantly towards the player. When the player is engaged, they can choose to either flee or enter combat. The game rolls a random damage value for the player and monster based upon items collected and power-ups discovered. Battle success is based upon when the player stops the random dice roll.",
