  "description": "<i>Dog Daze Deluxe</i> is a 2-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>A version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/dog-daze\">Dog Daze</a> with improved graphics and sound.  Two dogs appear n the screen, each controlled by a different player. Fire hydrants appear on the screen, and the first player to reach the hydrant makes it that color. Immediately a new hydrant then appears on the screen. If a target is not tagged fast enough, a car will drive across the screen, and if his a dog, it's game over.  On the top of the screen is a counter, and for every successfully tagged hydrant, it moves towards that player. The first person to take control of the counter is the winner. If the player runs into a hydrant previously tagged by an opponent, they also lose a point, until the screen is almost filled by tagged hydrants. Each player can throw a bone, and if hits an untagged hydrant, the player gains the point. If the bone misses, it needs to be collected before it can be thrown again. ",
