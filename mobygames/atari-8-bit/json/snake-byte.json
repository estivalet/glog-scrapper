  "description": "The object of <i>Snake Byte</i> is to guide your snake to the apples that appear on the screen. Gobble up an apple, and another appears. Your snake also grows longer. Gobble up ten apples without hitting a wall or any part of your own ever-growing body, and a door to the next level opens. Thread your way through the door and you start over again, this time on a more complicated screen. As you move from level to level, the obstacles become more difficult.<br><br>As you play, bars on each side of the display inch toward the top of the screen. Should they complete their journey before you've eaten an apple, you are penalized: Three more apples are added to the total you must eat before completing the level.",
