  "description": "<i>Megalegs</i> is a 1-player <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Centipede\">Centipede</a></i> clone for the Atari 400/800.<br><br>The player controls a small character which can move horizontally at the bottom of the screen.  The player can fire rapidly vertically towards the top of the screen.  A large centipede starts at the top of the screen and moves horizontally in rows towards the player.  The centipede breaks into segments when shot, and the player moves to a more challenging level every time a centipede is destroyed.  Further complicating the player's task are Dweebs which fall directly towards the player, and Squirtles which hop about the screen.  If the player is struck by any of these enemies, they lose a life.  The field regularly fills with mushrooms which serve to block the player's firing and monster movement.  The player starts with 3 lives, and gains an additional life every 10,000 points.  ",
