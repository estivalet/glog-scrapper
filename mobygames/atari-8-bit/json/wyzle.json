  "description": "<i>Wyzle!</i> is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>The player controls a small spaceship with limited fuel on a small horizontally scrolling level.  Gravity invariably pulls the ship downwards, while upwards thrust uses limited fuel.  The ship is armed with horizontally firing cannons, and can also drop bombs.  Fuel depots refuel the ship if destroyed.  The player starts with 4 ships, and it's game over if all are lost.  The goal is to destroy as many enemy installations as possible.",
