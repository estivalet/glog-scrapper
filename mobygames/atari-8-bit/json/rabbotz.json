The player is armed with a limited number of mines they can release, and if the rabbotz step on them, they are destroyed.  The player can move in the cardinal directions, and must be careful to avoid their own mines.  Smiley faces appear, which provide bonus points if gathered.  The player earns more mines by stepping in the house icon, which moves each time mines are collected.  There are 9 levels of difficulty, and player can define whether they start with 1 - 9 lives.  ",
