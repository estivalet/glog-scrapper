  "description": "<i>Hexapawn</i> is a basic board game designed for 1-person versus computer play.<br><br>Played on a 3 x 3 board with 3 computer-controlled pawns on the top of the screen and 3 human-controlled pawns at the bottom.  The pawns can move forwards, and an opponent's piece on the diagonal.  The player wins by moving one of their pieces to the back row, taking all of the computer's pieces, or preventing the computer from moving.  The computer wins by doing the same.  The computer will only make the same mistake once, and every game it becomes progressively more difficult to beat, until ultimately it becomes unbeatable.  The human player always goes first, and in a perfect game the first player always loses.  ",
