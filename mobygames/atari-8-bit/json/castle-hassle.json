  "description": "<i>Castle Hassle</i> is a action adventure game, combining elements and puzzles from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/action-quest\">Action Quest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/ghost-encounters\">Ghost Encounters</a> into one game.<br><br>Played from a top-down perspective, the player controls a small ghost within a haunted mansion of 60 rooms, who is tasked with collecting 40 treasures.  The ghost is armed with a small gun, which can fire in eight directions that can be used to defeat enemies and solve puzzles. The ghost can further transform into useful objects such as: magnet, hammer, shovel, key and a torch which can be used to solve some of the puzzles.  Each room has a name, which might provide a hint, and the player has a limited time to gather the treasure in each of them.  The game is divided into ten levels and a bonus score will be given after each based on an overall timer. The player starts with 10 lives, and if all are lost it's game over.  At start the player can select between 3 difficulty levels: child, teenager, and adult, which influence the time available in each room.  ",
