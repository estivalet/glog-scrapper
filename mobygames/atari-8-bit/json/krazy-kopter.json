  "description": "<i>Krazy Kopter</i> is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>You are involved in a war with a neighboring country, which has captured 2 of your top secret agents.  They have effected their escape by hijacking a green army truck and are desperately trying to navigate their way home. You have been scrambled in your helicopter to aid their escape by eliminating the fleet of cars in pursuit.  <br><br>The player controls a helicopter that moves in all directions, and can drop bombs. The player must destroy any cars that appear before they can leave the bridge.  A car when hit often immediately reverses direction.  If a car escapes, hostile forces are alerted, and the player will be shot down by a missile.  If the player shots the green army truck, they are also destroyed.  There are 3 levels of difficulty.  Level 1 has navy missiles.  Level 2 adds anti-aircraft rockets, and level 3 further adds zig-zagging UFOs.  The level progresses after destroying 75 cars.  The player starts with 9 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.  ",
