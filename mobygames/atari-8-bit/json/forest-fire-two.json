  "description": "<i>Forest Fire Two</i> is a game for one or two players.<br><br>The player's job is to stop a rapidly spreading forest fire.  The nearby countryside is displayed on an 18 x 9 grid, which includes, woods, dry brush, lakes, your fire tower, a fuel depot, the governor's mansion, and a supply base. Each turn, the player is able to drop fire retardant, set up a ground crew, and dig a fire break.  The goal is to minimize property damage to the surrounding countryside.  The player takes a significant financial hit if the governor's mansion burns down, and if the fuel depot catches on fire all nearby areas ignite.  If the supply base burns, then resources to fight the fire become more scarce.  Wind conditions will effect the direction of spread and the speed of the fire.<br><br>The player can select stable, unstable, or very unstable wind patterns, and can also start a game with a fire caused by a mild, moderate, or severe thunderstorm.  Terrain options include wide open, country, and congested.",
