  "description": "<i>Ghost Encounters</i> is a puzzle game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>This is the sequel to <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/action-quest\">Action Quest</a></i>.  Played from a top-down perspective, the player controls a small ghost within a haunted mansion, who is tasked with collecting a number of treasures. The ghost is armed with a small gun, which can fire in 8 directions, and can be used to defeat monsters and solve puzzles. New in this game, the ghost can further transform into useful objects, including: a shovel, a torch, a key, and can make itself thinner.  Each room has a short description which might provide a hint, and the player has a limited timeframe to gather the treasure on each level before turning from white to dark and losing a life.  The player starts with 10 lives, and if all are lost it's game over.",
