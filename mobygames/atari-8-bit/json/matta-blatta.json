  "description": "<i>Matta Blatta</i> is a simple side-scrolling shoot-'em'-up. The player controls a space ship traveling down a long corridor against endless waves of erratically-moving enemies. Each wave consists of a different type of enemy with a different movement and firing pattern. There are two types of power-ups that appear; one will increase the ship's firepower and movement speed, while the other will grant a temporary shield.",
