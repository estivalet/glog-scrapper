  "description": "<i>Rush Hour</i> is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>The player controls a car that must travel across 6 lanes of traffic and a railroad track in order to reach the fuel pumps on the far side.  The vehicle will always travel horizontally within lanes, but can be steered left and right.  There are 4 fuel pumps, and the player must navigate a vehicle to each of these.  After doing this, the game becomes more difficult with thicker traffic.  The vehicle has 2 speeds.  The player starts with 3 cars, and it's game over if all are lost by hitting another vehicle.   There's limited fuel to compete each level.",
