  "description": "<i>Lunar Lander</i> is one of many variants on a moon landing theme.<br><br>The player controls a small lunar modules, whose goal is to land on one of the few safe flat plains on the moon's surface.  The player has limited fuel, and receives points for each successful landing they make.  The player controls vertical and horizontal thrust, with gravity continuously pulling the vessel downward.  The player is awarded points based upon the difficulty of each landing site.  If the player makes contact with the ground too fast or on uneven terrain, their lander is lost.  <br><br>In the TRS-80 version, the screen zooms in as the player closely approaches the ground.  The player starts with 5000 fuel, and must make as many landings that they can with this.  In the Atari version, the screen is fixed, and the player has a total of 5 landing attempts to maximize score.  \n",
