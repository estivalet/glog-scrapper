  "description": "<i>Math Mileage</i> is an educational game that mixed racing with mathematics. The player is driving a formula racing car from a top down perspective and has to reach a goal in the shortest and fastest way. The road has a number of forks and over each branch there is a sign with a mathematical operation which changes the mileage when driving through. For example if the goal distance is 20 miles the player has to choose two +10 branches. The goal has to be reached exactly and if the mileage is larger than the goal the player will be rerouted and need to go through a branch that either subtracts or divides the mileage.<br><br>There are three skill levels. The easiest one has only two operators: +1 and +10. The two later levels have both additions and multiplications. Level 2 has always the same addition operation (+10) while on level 3 it is randomly selected from between two and nine. The multiplication operation is random on both levels from between two and five. Additionally there is an option for night driving. It differs in that the equations are not spelled out meaning that the player has to keep track of the mileage in his head.",
