  "description": "<i>Golden Gloves</i> is a boxing game viewed from a fixed side perspective. The game features single matches that can be played by one or two players or by two AI driven boxers. It's possible to choose between three and ten round matches and to impose a handicap on one of the boxers. The game is entirely played with joysticks where jabbing is done by pushing the button while hooks, blocks and ducking is done by pulling the stick. For each punch landed the player earns points. A normal punch is worth two points while a punch that forces the opponent back is worth five points. After a knockdown the player earns ten points and one point for every second that the opponent is down. If the opponent doesn't gets up, the player will win the match.",
