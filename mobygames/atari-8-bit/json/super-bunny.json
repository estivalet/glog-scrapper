If they get the carrot they are transformed into Super Bunny and must begin their journey back across the screen. In this super powered form the player can take revenge and defeat the critters standing in their way.<br><br><em>Super Bunny</em> is similar to &quot;cross the road&quot; games such as the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Frogger\">Frogger</a> and Activision's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Freeway\">Freeway</a>.<br><br>The original box came with a complete &quot;Super Bunny&quot; comic book written and illustrated by air-brush artist <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?developer=Martin+Cannon\">Martin Cannon</a>, staff artist at Datamost.",
