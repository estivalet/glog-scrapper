  "description": "<i>Planets</i> is a simple two-player game created for the &quot;NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014&quot; competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. <br><br>There are two planets on the screen, with a random size and position. Each player uses a joystick to control a cannon on the surface of his planet. The cannon can be moved along the surface of the planet, and a missile can be launched with the &quot;fire&quot; key. Missiles are affected by gravitational pull as they fly. A missile digs a hole in the planet when it strikes. The cannons cannot be moved over a hole in the planet's surface. A player wins if he destroys his opponent's planet by managing to fire a missile into its center. ",
