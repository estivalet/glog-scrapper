  "description": "<i>Wizard's Revenge</i> is a text-adventure for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>You have made a powerful wizard very angry.  As punishment, he has placed you in a strange land.  Your goal is to escape from there and return to the normal world alive.  The wizard has placed many traps and a few hints in your way to make things challenging for you.  The player has limited health, and starts at 50%.  Smaller injuries deplete health leading to death, while major injuries lead to instant death.  There is a basic combat system for monsters found throughout the land.  There are numerous dead ends and ways to die, including: poisonous snakes, rock slides, spike traps, cave bats, and consuming too much water.  The player must explore caverns and forests to escape to freedom.  <br><br>All commands are via VERB NOUN entry. The player can ask for help at any time to get advice on specific areas. There is no save or restore feature.",
