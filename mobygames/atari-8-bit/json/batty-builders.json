  "description": "<i>Batty Builders</i> is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>The player controls a small man on the bottom of the screen who can move horizontally, as well as a small distance vertically.  Blocks drop off a conveyor belt from above, and the player must position themselves under the falling blocks and catch them in outstretched arms.  If the player is not positioned in the center of the blocks or do not time their arms properly, they are crushed by the falling block and lose a life.  After catching a block, the player needs to throw it up into the gaps in the wall in front of them.  After completing the first wall, higher difficulties have rolling obstacles that the player must avoid while catching blocks.",
