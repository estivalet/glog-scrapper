  "description": "<i>Moogles</i> is an arcade game where the goal is to guide the eponymous moogles to the single exit of a maze.  The moogles will follow the arrows placed within the maze, and the player must quickly rotate these arrows to guide the moogles.  If two moogles come in contact, then the player loses a life.  The player is awarded bonus points based upon how quickly they can free the moogles from a maze.  Later levels have moogle tunnels, which allow the creatures to cross paths without coming in contact. On higher levels, moogles will move faster, increasing the challenge. The player starts with 3 lives, and if these are lost, it's game over.  ",
