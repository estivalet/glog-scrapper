  "description": "The game is a homebrew homage to various games and Atari-related themes. Development began in 2013 as <i>GTIA Blast!</i>, a tech demo that displayed the potential of the GTIA chip's rarely utilized graphics mode. Later it evolved into a complete game, and during development it took usage of the other graphics modes, thus was renamed to <i>AtariBlast!</i>.<br><br>It has vertically and horizontally scrolling levels themed after classic shootemups. Features include difficulty settings, level passcodes (in a Simon Says fashion), health bar, destroyable background elements, many different powerups with a limited timeout, and numerous bonuses. Multiple versions exist with different music.",
