The player is given the task of defeating four enemies for Yoturni, Wizard King of Drindisti:\n<ul>\n<li>The Glass Wizard. He lives in a cavern with apprentices and magical glass creatures. The player needs to make his way through a glass maze and also recover a treasure, the Book of Spells.</li>\n<li>The Illusionist. The player needs to return with his staff as proof of his death. The level he resides on is said to be incomprehensible and confusing, which is why there are no room numbers displayed. </li>\n<li>The High Priest. The leader of a temple where a creature known as the Demonmaster is worshipped.  </li>\n<li>The Demigod. He is found in the Realm of Mist, where again no room numbers are displayed because of the fog that covers the place. To find his target, a Sage which lives here may provide help to the player.</li>\n</ul>",
