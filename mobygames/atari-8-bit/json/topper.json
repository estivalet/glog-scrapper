  "description": "Poor Topper the Turtle. He just wants to liven up things by painting his tiles. But some tiles try to resist, there is dynamite trying to blow up tiles and rabbits trying to stop him (they haven't forgotten that race).<br><br><i>Topper</i> is strongly influenced by, and a variation of, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Q%2abert\">Q*bert</a>. You control Topper by moving the joystick in diagonal directions to jump from tile to tile. You must land on each tile to change its color. But the tiles do not want to be painted so some will blink out, causing you to fall and lose a life if you are standing on them or were jumping to them. Every four levels, the difficulty increases. You will later encounter dynamite that will pop from tile to tile. If you land on a tile with dynamite, it will explode and you lose a life. Further along, you will also have one or more rabbits that, if they are on the same tile with you, will cause you to lose a life. After all lives are lost, the game is over. In a two player game, play alternates.",
