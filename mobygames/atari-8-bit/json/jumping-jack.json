  "description": "Reaching the tops of 20 screens is the aim of Jack's life. The ledges go right across the screen, with gaps emerging at random intervals, through which Jack must aim. He can move along each ledge, and must avoid holes which open, as they can cause him to drop further. Later levels add aliens, snakes and all manner of other hazards, as well as an increasing number of holes. The control combination is unusual, and only comfortable on earlier Spectrum models - the game has no joystick mode.",
