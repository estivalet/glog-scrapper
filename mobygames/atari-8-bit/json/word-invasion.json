  "description": "<i>Word Invasion</i> is a 1-player word game for multiple systems.<br><br>The player controls a multi-tentacled alien while 4 columns of worlds quickly shift towards the player.  The player is told they need to find a pronoun, noun, preposition, adjective, or adverb, and must quickly shoot the correct item.  If they hit the correct word, the word disappears.  If they shoot an incorrect word, a new row quickly filters towards the player.  If the words reach the alien, it's game over. The player receives a point for each successful hit, and the goal is to survive as long as possible over 3 rounds",
