  "description": "The <i>Sesame Street</i> Muppets invite a child player for a spin on the <b>Letter-Go-Round</b>!. By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel, children practice recognizing and matching letters, simple spelling and word formation.<br><br>There are several types of game:<br>\n - Upper case matching; <br>\n - Lower case matching; <br>\n - Mixed case matching; <br>\n - One little word; <br>\n - What's missing?; <br>\n - Spell the secret word. <br><br>At the start of each game, one of Muppet pets brings out a letter to match or word to spell and drops it on the seesaw. A letter appears on each ferris wheel bucket and as the Letter-Go-Round spins, child player should find the right letter to match or complete a word. Child may choose and try any letter, because there is no time limit to play. When a match is made or a word is completed, Muppet pets will dance and cheer a child player to the next round of play.<br><br>The game is recommended for 1 player aged 3 to 4.",
