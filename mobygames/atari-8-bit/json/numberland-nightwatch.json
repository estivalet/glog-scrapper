  "description": "<i>Numberland Nightwatch</i> is a 1-player educational game for the 8-bit Atari.<br><br>In a distant region of the kingdom of Numberland is a small outpost of scholars, gathered together in a castle to ponder mathematical problems.  The king has charged them with solving a baffling mystery.  When night falls, and the kingdom is quiet, a strange phenomenon begins.  Numbers form in the atmosphere and fly across the sky.  They take with them some of the kingdom's valuable energy.  To stop them, you've built a generator and a pulsar, and now you have to bring the menacing numbers under control.  <br><br>As a number speeds past, you can grab it with your generator.  Then, race to the pulsar at the left, and set up a factor of one of the invaders.  As the number flies past the pulsar, fire the factor at the number, and repeat until all factors have been exhausted.  <br><br>There are 6 levels of difficulty. ",
