  "description": "<i>Impact</i> is a 2 - 4 player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer.<br><br>Each play controls a skimmer, which can move in all directions, and has inertia.  Each skimmer is armed with a bumper, which will temporarily enact a forcefield around their vessel.  If the player hits an unshielded vessel, they'll destroy it.  After the shield expires, that vessel is temporarily defenseless until the shield can recharge.  If 2 unshielded vessels collide, both are destroyed.  Each player starts with the same number of vessels, and the last player standing is the victor.  Players can set a timed game, and can give different players a handicap, allowing their shields to last longer.  There are 17 different game boards to choose from.  ",
