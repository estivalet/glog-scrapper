  "description": "<i>Volleyball</i> is a 2-player arcade volleyball game for the Apple II.<br><br>There are two servers on the far sides of the screen who can move left and right, as well as inner court players whom can do the same.  Players serve, and the opposing team has two bounces to try to return the ball over the net in the center of the screen.  If the ball hits the ground, either the serving team gains a point, or the opposing team loses their serve.  Game play continues until one team has 21 points.  The score for each team is displayed on the bottom of the screen.",
