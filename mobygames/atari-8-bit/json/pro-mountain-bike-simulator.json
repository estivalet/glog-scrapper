  "description": "<i>Pro Mountain Bike Simulator</i> allows you to ride over a course with various obstacles against a friend or the computer in the day or at night. The game is split screen and is viewed from the side and scrolls from left to right when you move your bike. You press right to move your bike, move up or down to steer and to change gears you hold down the fire button and press up or down. Certain obstacles like logs and holes can't be ridden over so you press fire to get off your bike and push it. Hitting an object throws you off your bike and wastes time and the winner is the person who finishes the course in the fastest time.<br><br>Included with the game was a course editor which allowed you to place obstacles as well as remove them on the course. You could also change the background objects as well.",
