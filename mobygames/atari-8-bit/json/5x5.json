  "description": "<i>5x5</i> is a puzzle-board game, based on the Polish TV game show <i>5×5</i>. The player's task is to guess a five letter password in five attempts. The final goal is to guess sixty passwords or earn 25000 in cash with less than 20 failed rounds. \nAfter typing each password the game shows the result in the lower row. A letter guessed correctly remains at the right place, a letter that appears in the password but at a different position is highlighted.\n<br>The game includes a total of about 500 passwords. Increasing the number of passwords is possible by using the game add-on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5x5-edytor-hase\">5x5 Edytor hase?</a>.",
