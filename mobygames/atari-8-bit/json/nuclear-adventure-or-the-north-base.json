To fulfill it he has to find the launching terminal. The task is not that easy as the base is a big labyrinth full of American soldiers. Enemies can be killed by shooting. Ammo can be bought in a shop but player can't spend much. There is a terminal in every room. It can be used to make contact with some people to gain information. Player has to get their number before contacting them. Some institutions or people can be contacted through a phone that player has to find. There are also characters that can be contacted only through Ministry of Defence terminal. In the end he has to find the Rocket launching terminal and hack it. Then he has to escape.",
