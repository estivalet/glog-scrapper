  "description": "<i>Commbat</i> is a two-player combat strategy game that is played via two separate systems connected by modem.<br><br>War has been declared between two nations regarding the mining rights of the third planet of the Deneb star system.  In accordance with Galactic Law, this issue shall be settled in single combat between the supreme champions of the governments in dispute.  Combat will occur within a designated space unbeknownst to both parties prior to the battle commencing.  Both sides will be given equal resources and troops, and battle will continue until one side concedes or is destroyed.  <br><br>A limited number of tanks, aircraft, ammunition, and nuclear missiles are available for each side, so resources must be carefully guarded.  The battle map consists of 6 separate screens, and vehicles can move in 8 individual directions. Graphic display is entirely text-based, and units and bases are represented by individual letters on the map.  Players load a limited number of mines, rockets, lasers, and shells onto their eight remote controlled tanks.  These tanks are then deployed into the field.  If they are damaged, they can return to the home base for repairs.  The ultimate goal is to destroy the enemy's base.<br><br>",
