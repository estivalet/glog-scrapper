  "description": "<i>Ogre</i> is a 2D turn-based strategy game, and a direct computer conversion of Steve Jackson's board game of supertanks going against conventional infantry with howitzers. It plays exactly like the board game - on a hex-based board one player controls ordinary military units (soldiers, tanks etc.), and defends against the second player, who controls a supertank named &quot;Ogre&quot; - Ogre is very powerful, and can easily destroy normal weaponry and ground forces.",
