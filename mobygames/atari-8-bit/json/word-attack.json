In this game, the player controls a small gnome who moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen.  A definition appears, and the player must shoot the appropriate definition with their hat before the timer on the right runs out.  As the player answers questions, the timer begins to drain quicker.  Every 5 correct answers in a row, the player advances a level, and the player receives 100 x the current level in points for each correct answer.  After all time has expired, the player receives a final score.  <br><br>",
