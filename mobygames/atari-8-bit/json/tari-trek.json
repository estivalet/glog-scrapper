  "description": "<i>Tari Trek</i> is a 1-player Star Trek themed turn-based strategy game for the Atari 400/800.<br><br>The player controls the USS Enterprise, as they travel through a large 8 x 8 galaxy map to destroy all Klingon warships.  All commands are via text input, and there are a total of 9 different difficulty levels. The player's goal is to warp between sectors to find and destroy enemy vessels.  The player is armed with phasers and torpedoes to engage Klingon vessels, and will also take ship damage from alien vessels during battle.  The player has limited energy to travel and engage in combat, as well as a limited time period, and if either are depleted, it is game over.  Thus, the player must carefully manage travel times versus energy cost, as well as the time and energy spent engaged in battle and repairs in order to destroy all Klingon vessels.  <br><br>",
