  "description": "<i>Battalion Commander</i> is a real-time tactical (platoon/company level) simulation of modern warfare. The player is put in the role of a lieutenant colonel in charge of an entire armored battalion of either U.S., Soviet, or Chinese army. A combination of 5 scenarios and 40 maps of varied terrain (rivers, hills, minefields) is available, as well as infantry, tanks, APCs, artillery, assault guns, and other units.<br><br>The commands are issued by pointing a spot on the map with the cursor (using the joystick) and then pressing a key combination selecting which company/platoon has to perform what action (these include fire support, smoke screen, laying bridges, digging in, etc.). A handicap can be chosen for either side to adjust difficulty.",
