  "description": "The player is guarding four full picnic tables while armed only with a fly-swatter and an occasional can of bug spray. Ants soon crawl on-screen and, in character, attempt to carry the food away. Spiders that lay delaying webs show up on round two, and can sting player, paralyzing him, if he isn't careful. A flying wasp, which also stings,  appears at random. Points are awarded for swatting any of these marauders. Each round lasts a minute and a half and, at the end of each round, bonus points are awarded for any remaining food. As soon as all food is pushed off of the screen, or a round ends with no food still on any of the tables, the game ends.",
