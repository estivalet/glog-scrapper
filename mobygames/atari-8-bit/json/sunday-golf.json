  "description": "<i>Sunday Golf</i> is a simple 1-4 player golf game which contains one 18-hole golf course.    <br><br>Utilizing a birds-eye view of the golf course, the player chooses their club and the direction of their shot.  The choice of club has no effect on a swing other than distance, and all shots go straight in the direction prescribed, with no wind or other factors affection play.  Hazards including sand traps and water are present.<br><br>When the player lands a ball on the green, gameplay shifts to a 2-dimensional side-view, where the player must select a shot strength between 1 and 50.  Greens have hills, which can influence how much strength is required, and the player will overshoot the hold if too much strength is directed.  Score is maintained throughout all 18 holes.",
