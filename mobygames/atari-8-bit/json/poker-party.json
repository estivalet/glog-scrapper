Each player starts with $100, and each computer opponent has a name and a different play personality.  The ante initially starts at $1 and increases with each deal that no one opens.  The cost to raise, bet, and fold increases with each game.  Three rounds of betting are permitted before and after the draw.  When a computer opponent or the player runs out of money, they are eliminated from the game.  ",
