  "description": "Somewhere between Never Never Land and next Thursday lies a jungle orchard of fruit ripening beneath the peppermint sun.  It's the perfect place for the “Hungry' to gobble up fruit, but care must be taken to avoid the killer bugs which infest the orchard.  <br><br><i>Tutti Frutti</i> is a 1 - 2 player game, where the player controls a set of jaws whose goal is to gobble up fruit. Each stage contains different fruit, trees, and intermittently spawning bugs.  The goal is to eat all the fruit within the allotted time, by moving overtop the fruit.  Trees merely create barricades to movement.  Killer bugs will spawn, and follow the player for a limited time period. If they contact the player, a life is lost.  If the player eats all the fruit, they will advance to a more challenging stage.  <br><br>The player starts with a total of 3 lives, and when all are lost it's game over.  The player has options to control the speed of the bugs, and the forest thickness at game setup.",
