  "description": "The goal is to collect all the keys on each level to open up the exit. This is a puzzle platformer game, and this is meant literally: the world has to be manipulated like a sliding tile puzzle in order to be able to reach the keys. Each tile is about one screen big, with floors where you can walk, and a number of exits. <br><br>Holding down the fire button brings up an overview of the level where you can manipulate tiles to join the appropriate corridors. Some places require tricky workarounds to be able to enter. <br><br>There are some hazards, like falling into a pit that joins to nowhere, or touching a cactus. These result to teleport you onto the starting point, but you have endless lives. The levels also can be accessed via a password system.\n",
