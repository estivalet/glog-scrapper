  "description": "<i>The Time Machine</i> is the second in the <i>Mysterious Adventure</i> series of  text adventures by Brian Howarth.  You are a newspaper reporter, come to investigate the eccentric professor who lives all by himself out on the moors. You start the game in a swamp and must find your way to an old manor house.  When you get there, you find the place deserted though.  Ultimately you must rescue the professor by finding 3 missing prisms which control his time machine, which are lost in time.  Items found in one destination sometimes have to be used in another.<br><br>As the other games in the series, the game uses an interpreter similar to the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus also has the same limitations - a basic 2-word parser, limited vocabulary, and brief descriptions. Illustrations are included in Spectrum, C64, Dragon and Oric ports.",
