  "description": "<i>Fred</i> is a platform game, where the player controls a caveman, walking horizontally through the levels. Like in nearly every platform game, there are hanging platforms for the caveman to jump on, though sometimes parts of the platforms give way. Climbable ropes also appear. <br><br>There are enemies on the way, such as birds and frogs; Fred can defend himself by tossing rocks that travel in an arc, though ammunition is limited, but Fred can pick up new rocks along the way. Another weapon is the spray can; when found, Fred can spray in front of himself, killing enemies this way. Contact with an enemy or a hazard (such as a cactus) costs a life and sends the player back to the last checkpoint. <br><br>Weapons can also be used to crack open jugs found along the way. There are pick-ups to find inside, such as rocks, ammunition for the spray can, a cap that protects from a single loss of life, or shields that make Fred immune to all dangers. <br><br>The game was originally released in 1990 as part of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/misjafred\">compilation</a>.
