  "description": "<i>I. Q. Baseball</i> is an animated baseball trivia game for 1 - 2 players.<br><br>Played on an animated baseball field, the player can compete against the computer or another human.  Every time a pitch is thrown, the player is asked a multiple choice question related to baseball. If the player is batting, and answers an answer correctly, there is a chance they'll successfully score a hit, or potentially a run.  If they are wrong, they'll strike out.  There is a small chance of getting out even with a correct answer.  If competing against the computer, the player must answer questions while pitching, to try to strike their computer opponent out.  Each game involves 9 innings, with 3 outs per inning.",
