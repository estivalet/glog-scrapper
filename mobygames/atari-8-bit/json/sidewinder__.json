As a pilot the player must escape through the caverns guarded by an enemy security system. The advanced Sidewinder technology costs a lot of fuel consumption. To refuel the helicopter, the player must shoot the fuel pods scattered in various places throughout the caverns. To advance to the next level, the player must reach the landing pad at the far end of the cavern.",
