  "description": "<i>Space Rescue</i> is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems.<br><br>The year is 2086.  just a few months ago, the United States launched an exploration party to search the planet Arcturus II for any signs of life.  Our radar, however, just picked up a huge meteor storm headed straight for that solar system which threatens the lives of all the people there.  You are their only hope for their survival.<br><br>The player controls a small orbiting mother ship, which launches a rescue vehicle towards the planet's surface.  The mother ship moves left and right, while the player chooses where to launch.  Then, the rescue vessel descends, and the player must move the vessel left and right to avoid touching any of the asteroids, and landing on the awaiting landing pad.  <br><br>There, one member of the exploration party gets into the vessel, and the player must navigate the vessel back up through the now altered asteroid field and dock with the mother ship.  The player's goal is to rescue all 6 awaiting members of the exploration party.  The player has 3 rescue vessels, and if all are lost it's game over.  ",
