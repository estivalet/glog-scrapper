  "description": "<i>Jumpman Junior</i> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Jumpman\">Jumpman</a> and features similar gameplay with all new levels. As Jumpman, your goal is to disarm all of the bombs on the level before time runs out. Each level consists of a variety of platforms, ladders, and ropes you will need to jump and climb to reach the bombs. To make the game more challenging, a bullet will fire on the screen from time to time which will cause Jumpman to lose a life if hit. Each level has a different theme to it, and a few also have additional dangers as well. You will encounter deadly fires, the bouncing hellstones, moving ladders, disappearing platforms, and more.",
