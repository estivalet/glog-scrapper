  "description": "Your task is to eliminate all robots in a level by deactivating their RGB components. To deactivate a component, shoot at the robot with a missile that has the colour you want to deactivate. For example, to deactivate a red robot, shoot at him with a red missile; to deactivate a cyan robot, shoot at him with a blue missile and than a green missile (or vice versa); to deactivate a white robot, shoot at him with red, green and blue missiles consecutively in any order. You can change your missiles' colour at the recalibrators or by picking up certain bonuses. There are 8 levels in the game with increasing width and complexity, including the single-screen introductory level 0. When you run out of energy, the game is over.",
