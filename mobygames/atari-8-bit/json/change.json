  "description": "<i>Change</i> is a puzzle/arcade game. The protagonist is Tuptacz, whose plantation has been invaded by alien creatures known as Spheres. To save the farm from destruction, Tuptacz must repair the forcefield on each of the forty-eight levels by arranging the generator's elements in the right order. To complicate matters, he is allergic to the plants grown on his plantation and can only walk upon designated paths. <br><br>Each level is a mazelike path around which our hero can move, with the occasional crossroads. At will, the hero can rotate, by 90 degrees, the square section that he's in. The goal on each level is to rotate the elements until the maze forms a closed loop without blind alleys. The hero can walk through thin walls to accomplish his goal.  <br><br>A deadly, roving sphere on each level must be avoided; colliding with it kills instantly. Every level also has a time limit. Going over this limit, or going off the edge of the screen, kills the hero as well. ",
