  "description": "It is May 8, 1941 and you are Captain of the mighty German battleship Bismarck the single most powerful ship in the Atlantic. Hitler has given you the nearly impossible task of fighting through the British Home Fleet and sinking enough convoys to force Britain to surrender. Your level of victory will be determined by how many merchant ships and battleships you can sink. Your decisions will determine the fate of the Bismarck.",
