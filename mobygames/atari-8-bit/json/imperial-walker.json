The goal is to shoot down menacing spaceships which harass the walker.  The player has 30 seconds, and is awarded 10 points for every space ship shot, but loses 1 point if their shot misses, and loses 10 points if they are shot in the neck.  In a 2-player game, 1 player additionally controls the space ship.  <br><br><i>Auto Race</i> - The player controls a small car which must navigate a series of twisty passages.  The player can turn left or right, and has a total of 4 speeds.  If their vehicle strikes a wall, it is game over.  The player gains points dependent on how far and fast they travel.  There are 4 difficulty levels of tracks.<br><br><i>Laser Nim</i> - Based upon the game <i><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/android-nim\">Android Nim</a></i>, the player controls 3 robots, who can selectively remove 1, 2, or 3 robots from a series of 2, 4, or 5 robots.  Each player takes turns removing robots, with the winner being the player whom removes the last robot.<br><br><i>Gunfight</i> - A 1-player versus computer or 2-player game, where two cowboys attempt to shoot each other.  Each cowboy has 5 shots per round, and the 1st player can only shoot right, and the second player can only shoot left.  The fighters move on a cactus-infested field, and the player gains a point if they shoot their opponent.  Best out of 11 is the victor.  <br><br><i>Snake &amp; Shake</i> - The player controls a snake that progressively elongates every time it collects a pellet on the field.  The player is awarded 10 points for every pellet collected.  The player is destroyed if they run into a wall or into their own snake.\n",
