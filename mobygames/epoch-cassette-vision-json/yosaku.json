  "description": "<i>Yosaku</i> is an action game where the player takes control of a lumberjack who has to cut down two trees. The game is viewed from the side and the player can move left and right while using his axe to chop away at the trees. The player is not alone as various violent animals interrupt him during his work. These include pigs that rush across the screen, birds that drop eggs from above and snakes that attacks from beneath the ground. If contact is made with the animals the player loses one of his initial six lives. To defend himself the player can jump away from the animals or he can use his axe to kill them. The player also has to watch out for branches falling from the trees. Points are earned for hitting the trees. To fell a tree a number of hits on each side of it is needed. Once both trees are cut down the game continues with two new trees.",
