  "description": "Poor little mice, doomed to run around in a maze and escape as quickly as they can. As if that's not enough, the owners of this maze pit you against a friend to see who will escape first. And then the diabolical owners take it one step further and add a cat to the maze mix - forcing you not only to escape first, but escape alive!<br><br>There are 4 maze types:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Maze:</b> A straight maze run.</li>\n<li><b>Jailbreak:</b> The maze is a grid with hidden passages.</li>\n<li><b>Blind-man's-bluff:</b> The maze is invisible and no walls can ever be seen.</li>\n<li><b>Trailblazer:</b> The maze is invisible but the rats leave a trail on their path.</li>\n</ul><br>\nThere are also a few game modes:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Regular Maze:</b> Two players race each other out of the maze.</li>\n<li><b>Cat and Mouse:</b> The computer controls a cat that chases the mice. There are 4 different speeds for the cat.</li>\n<li><b>Paranoia:</b> Neither mouse can leave the maze until the other one is caught by the cat.</li>\n<li><b>Double Paranoia:</b> There's no cat and neither mouse can leave the maze, allowing the players to practice or experiment play modes.</li>\n</ul>",
