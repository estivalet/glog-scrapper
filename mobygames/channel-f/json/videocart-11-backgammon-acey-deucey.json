  "description": "The original game of backgammon for the first 2nd-generation console of 1977.  Players take turn rolling dice and then moving their pieces around the game board.  Blue &amp; Red each have to move all their pieces off the board to win, and are competing against each other and against lady luck herself.  <br><br><i>Acey-Deucey</i> is another way to play Backgammon where the starting position is different.  Instead of starting the game with numerous pieces arranged at places around the board, you start with all your pieces at the starting line.  It makes for a longer game, although just as strategic and challenging.",
