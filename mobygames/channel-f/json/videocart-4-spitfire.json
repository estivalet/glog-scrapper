  "description": "<em>Videocart-4</em> features the action game <i>Spitfire</i>. This is an aerial dogfighting game that pits the Red Baron against the Blue Max. The goal is to try to shoot down your opponent to score a point, and the player with the most points wins. Viewed from the side, your bi-planes have the freedom to fly anywhere on the screen; the screen wraps, so if you fly off of one side you will appear again on the other side. You can also hide just off screen to attempt to sneak up on an opponent; be careful, even though you may not be visible you are still vulnerable to attacks! The game can be played by two players against each other, or one player against the computer. When playing against the computer, the computer's skill level will vary throughout the game; the more times you are successful in shooting down the computer, the more its skill level will increase! However the more the computer shoots you down, the more its skill level will decrease.",
