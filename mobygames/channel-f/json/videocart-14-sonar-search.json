  "description": "<i>Sonar Search</i> features the basic gameplay idea of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Battleship\">Battleship</a>, but with a unique twist. Instead of trying to randomly guess what grid an opponent's battleship is on, after the player takes a shot, the player will hear a  sonar ping noise. The shorter the noise, the closer the player is to hitting a target.<br><br>In the 1 player game, the player has a limited number of chances to sink the enemy fleet of ships, while in the 2 player game,  players take turns trying to sink their opponents ships before  having their own ships sunk.",
