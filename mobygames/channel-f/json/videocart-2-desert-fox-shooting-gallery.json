  "description": "<em>Videocart-2</em> features two game programs:\n<ol>\n<li><b>Desert Fox</b>: In this game you control one of two tanks engaged in a battle. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting your opponent. On the game screen there are two barriers (located in the upper left and bottom right corners) and five mines (located in the middle of the screen). The tanks can not shoot through the barriers or mines making them ideal for cover. The tanks can drive through the barriers, but attempting to drive through a mine will cause your tank to explode awarding your opponent a point.</li>\n<li><b>Shooting Gallery</b>: In this game you control a rifle on the left side of the screen and need to hit a target on the right side of the screen. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by hitting the target with as few misses as possible. You can play with no time limit at an average speed, or increase the challenge by adding a time limit and increasing the game speed. This game can also be played by two players to see who can score the most hits.</li></ol>",
