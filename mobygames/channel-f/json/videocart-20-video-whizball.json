  "description": "<i>Video Whizball</i> is a game where players control paddles that have to protect a goal from being entered by whizballs. To protect their goal, the player's paddle can fire missiles which can be aimed straight or angled up or downward. Missiles that hit whizballs can help propel them to start going in an opposite direction. If one of the missiles or whizballs hits the player's or the opponent's paddle, it will temporarily disappear leaving the respective goal undefended. The game is won when either one of the players gets to a previously selected score.<br><br>The game contains 72 game variations of this basic premise. Variations include having from 1 to 4 whizballs, and 6 different game types:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Basic</b>: each whizball is worth only 1 point;</li>\n<li><b>Basic Plus</b>: players can guide the missile shots into the whizballs;</li>\n<li><b>Bonus</b>: whizballs can be numbered 1 through 4 and are worth that many points each;</li>\n<li><b>Bonus Plus</b>: adds guided missiles to the Bonus game type;</li>\n<li><b>Super Bonus</b>: whizballs increase in value from 1 to 9 points the longer they stay in play;</li>\n<li><b>Super Bonus Plus</b>: adds guided missile shots to the Super Bonus game type.</li>\n</ul>",
