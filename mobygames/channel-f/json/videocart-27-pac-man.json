  "description": "An unauthorized version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/pac-man\">Pac-Man</a>. <br><br><i>Pac-Man</i> is a game where the eponymous Pac-Man goes around a maze in the cardinal directions munching pellets as he goes. The goal is to eat all the pellets found on the maze. While trying to do this, Pac-Man is harassed by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) who constantly chase him around the maze. If the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he will lose a life.  Pac-Man starts with three lives and if he loses all of them the game will end. <br><br>Pac-Man is not completely defenseless as on each maze, there are four power pellets, that when Pac-Man consumes them, will cause the tides to turn, as Pac-Man will be able to temporarily chase the ghosts to eat them and temporarily send them back to the middle of the maze from whence they came. Pac-Man can also eat randomly appearing fruit to earn bonus points.<br><br>This version of <i>Pac-Man</i> retains the intermissions found in the original game.",
