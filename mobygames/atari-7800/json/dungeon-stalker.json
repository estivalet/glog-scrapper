  "description": "Dungeon Stalker is a top down third person dungeon crawler that is a homage to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Night+Stalker\">Night Stalker</a>. <br><br>Your task is collect treasure and fight enemies until you earn enough points to move to the next dungeon level and destroy its evil wizard.  You will encounter a variety of creatures and obstacles along the way, including spiders, bats, snakes, skeleton warriors, and demon bats. When you have earned enough points to move to the next level, you must face the wizard.<br><br>To defeat these enemies, you must use your arrows sparingly. Once you deplete your quiver, another will be placed randomly in the dungeon. A sword will sometimes appear in the dungeon, and collecting it will give you twenty seconds of invincibility. At the beginning of the game (below 37,500 points), you can use the bunker as a safe harbor from enemies.<br><br>Dungeon Stalker has four skill settings.",
