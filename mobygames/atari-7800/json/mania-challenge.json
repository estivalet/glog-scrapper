  "description": "<i>Mania Challenge</i> is the sequel to the wrestling game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/mat-mania\">Mat Mania</a>. The gameplay and features (including the moves of the wrestlers, except for the addition of a drop kick) are completely identical. The most important addition is a versus mode against another human players. The unnamed wrestler protagonist from the original version is now called Dynamite Tommy. In the versus mode he only can fight a clone character with identical moves known as Hurricane Joe.<br><br>In the single-player mode the roster from the original game has been made smaller. Dynamite Tommy has to fight Insane Warrior, Golden Hulk and Hurricane Joe (except when continuing a two-player game in single-player as Joe, then Tommy is an opponent). The three other wrestlers Karate Fighter, Coco Savage and The Pirania are no longer available as opponents. After completing the game all three of them can be fought again in an endless loop.<br><br>The later released Atari 7800 version has some differences in the graphics and includes different difficulty levels for the single-player mode.",
