  "description": "<i>Soroban Gu</i> is a puzzle game. Gameplay involves moving blocks in horizontal and vertical lines to create chains of 3 or more. The player can combo chains by moving blocks into a currently fading chain to multiply points. New blocks appear in intervals with markers appearing on the field. If there are blocks currently occupying that space, the player loses health and a new block will not spawn in that location.",
