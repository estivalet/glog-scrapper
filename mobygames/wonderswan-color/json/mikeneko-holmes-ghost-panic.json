  "description": "<i>Mikeneko Holmes: Ghost Panic</i> is a mystery game based on popular <i>Mikeneko Holmes</i> novels by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,630169/\">Akagawa Jir?</a>, a Japanese mystery novel writer. The protagonist in this mystery story is none other than Holmes, the cat, not Sherlock, who got involved in a murder incident in an old castle somewhere in southern part of Germany, which is nowadays used as a sightseeing hotel. Ancient legends about witches, demons and strange phenomena are well known in the area, which adds a touch of supernatural to be feared of, if any of it true.<br><br>This game is made to play as a sound comic, meaning the artwork is made as an interactive comic book which progresses the story, yet allowing the player to enter choices which will take the story in a different direction and lead to one of several different endings.",
