  "description": "<i>Star Hearts</i> is a WonderSwan Color exclusive fantasy action role-playing game set in the fictional world of Uras, which has a large floating fortress in the center. The protagonist is selectable by the player at the beginning of the game, either the boy or the girl depicted on the front cover, together with some input such as the name, date of birth, and a blood type. The story starts with the player character about to become the new village chief. The ceremony gets interrupted by a bunch of attacking monsters and the hero barely escapes with their life. <br><br>The game uses a 3/4 view where the player moves in a vertical and horizontal way, can interact with other NPCs and fight enemies on the screen using projectiles or blunt weapons. Fighting is done in real-time, and after battling many weaker enemies, one will usually face a boss. While the player starts the game alone, they will get a pet companion, choosable out of four different types, in the middle of the journey. Leveling up is not done through gaining experience from combat, but instead by finding fairies scattered around the land.",
