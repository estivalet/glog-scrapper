  "description": "<i>Robix</i> is a fixed screen platform game where the player takes control of a small robot. The robot's task is to retrieve broken computers that are scattered around each of the game's levels. The robot can walk left and right, climb stairs and make a short jump forward which is needed to overcome the many obstacles and pitfalls that are in its way. Among these are gates that open and close and floors that appear and disappear. Any contact with one of the obstacles or falling from a height causes the robot to lose one life. The player starts with three lives and when all used up gets a score based on the number of computers that have been collected. An extra life is earned upon the completion of a level.",
