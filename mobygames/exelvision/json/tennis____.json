  "description": "<i>Tennis</i> is a computer recreation of the sport similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/tournament-tennis\">Match Point/Tournament Tennis</a> from the year before. Like that game it uses a third person perspective viewed from a rear camera. The controls are simple with directional keys used to move the player around the court and a single button for hitting the ball. <br><br>Various options exist. There are three different courts with different colour schemes (blue/red, blue/blue and red/blue). There are three difficulty levels (debutant, amateur and pro) and the game can be played by either one or two players. There is also a demo mode showing off two AI players competing. The game can only be played in single matches but it is possible to choose the number of sets: three or five. ",
