  "description": "<i>Car Crash</i> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?game=Head+On\">Head On</a>. The player controls a car that races on a circuit consisting of five lanes. The circuit is full of dots that have to be collected to complete a level. The car moves automatically clockwise and it is only possible to change lane in the the middle of each straight. From the opposing direction comes a jam car that attempts to crash into the player's car. If it succeeds the player will lose one of three lives. <br><br>The game can be played by one or two players. There are two variants of the two-player mode. In both the players take turns attempting to collect the dots either against an AI driven jam car or having the second player taking the role of the jam car. The speed of the player car can be chosen before a game: twice the pace of the jam car, same pace or half the pace. It is also possible to select a difficulty level from one to nine. ",
