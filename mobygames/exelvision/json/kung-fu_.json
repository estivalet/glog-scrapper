  "description": "<i>Kung-Fu</i> is a martial arts game featuring one-on-one fighting for one player against an AI opponent or between two human players. The game is seen from a side view perspective and consists of single matches that are each made up of three rounds. Each round lasts ninety seconds and the goal is simply to have the highest score at the end of the third round. Points are earned each time the opponent is knocked down. It is possible to do four different attacks each corresponding to one of the directional keys on the keyboard (or joystick). There is one punch attack and three different kicks. Movement is limited to moving in two directions, advancing and retreating.",
